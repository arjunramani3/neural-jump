Trading Active on the Downturn
For the first time since the advance in prices got underway, trading was more active on the downturn in Saturday's late dealings than during the period of market recovery earlier in the session. In the first half hour, when prices were above Friday’s finish, only 480,000 shares were traded in, while in the final half hour, when prices were on the downgrade, volume totaled 950,000 shares. Stocks gave way rather easily, and there was a scarcity of nearby bids in some issues.
Heaviest Volume Since 1930
Trading in stocks last week reached 26,275,167 shares, a daily average of 4,379,194 shares, and the heaviest volume since the week ended June 30, 1930. The broad markets of April, and so far this month, have put many brokerage houses emphatically in black figures. The latter were welcome after March, when only 20,075,557 shares changed hands dn the IS trading sessions. Last week’s trading volume was about 30% higher than the total for the entire month of March.
Heavy profit-taking came into both the stock and bond markets in the closing session of the week, and finally brought about the long waited reaction in the stock market. After holding steady in the face of selling through the first hour and a half of trading, the list turned downward in the last half hour, slipping off fast in an active market.. Losses ran to 3 points or more in some of the active stocks. Trading volume totaled 2,090,000 shares, a big Saturday market.
Selling came into the second-grade rail bond group, which has had an extremely sharp raise, and made for considerable price irregularity. A number of junior carrier bonds set new	‘	*
previous held up. Renewed a feature of the foreign department.
Irregularity in the markets reflected the cross-currents in the news. Weakness in the dollar in the foreign exchange markets brought serme buying into stocks. On the other hand, the British cabinet’s objections to the American tariff truce proposals, and the prospect that there might be more international dissension before the London Economic Conference in June, had a dampening effect. Favoring business news, particularly on the steel industry, and the sharp upturn in railroad traffic, nourished special groups of stocks.
The commodity markets did not take their guidance from the sharp upswings in commodities in the foreign markets. Wheat had a mixed opening, despite higher prices in Liverpool, turned weak, rallied and then dropped sharply. Cotton opened up almost SI a bale, then worked lower, closing up 1 to 7 points.
In London, stocks moved generally higher. The Baris bourse was closed, following the usual custom of only five days of trading during the summer period.
Secretary Ickes and the Cement Industry
The cement industry, most units of which have been operating at a loss for the past two years, received an assault from an unexpected quarter when Secretary Ickes charged the industry with price-fixing agreements in a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission. The Secretary’s move followed his announcement that 10 companies had submitted identical bids on cement for Boulder Dam.	’
Coming so soon after President Roosevelt’s speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce, in which the President urged industry to co-operate to bring order out of chaos, the Secretary’s complaint has a peculiar ring. Cooperation by industry means, among other things, co-operation to tabilize prices. Cutthroat competition from minorities in industries, as the speech, has been o ne tors in upsetting the
highs, while others slid under their best prices. High-grade rail issues and Government bonds were steady, heaviness in German obligations was
out in his fac-

President pointed of the major industrial apple-cart.
The Administration's moves on currency have been designed with an eye to bringing about an advance in domestic prices. With wheat up around 50% since March 3, and similar gains scored by other commodities, it is hardly surprising that cement companies are asking 8.4% more for a barrel of cement now than they were two months ago.
The Loew’s, Inc., Report
The report of Loew’s, Inc., for the 23 weeks ended March 16 was about in line with previous estimates, with net income equal to $1.04 a share on the common. The period is the best of the year for the company, as it includes the winter season, when movie attendance is at its height. During the summer months, there is always a seasonal falling off in motion picture company earnings. This was peculiarly severe last summer, with more than the normal number of summer theatre closings and a greater than seasonal decline in attendance. If the current betterment in general busmess holds, the motion picture companies can look forward to a better summer this year than last.
Motor Sales Prospects
Seasonally, motor sales should taper off in May after a peak on the seasonal spring upswing in April, but various factors, particularly the bank holiday, will prolong the spring sales season this year, according to motor trade circles. The sharp pickup in motor sales in the final week of March and throughout April did not fill the vacuum caused by the bank holiday, and so far in May motor sales have held up well in comparison with the early April figures. It is quite possible now that the motor sales season will extend well into June.
Last year, the delay in bringing out the new Ford models held back the seasonal spring upturn in the motor business, and sales didn’t reach their peak until June. In the three previous years, however, April saw the peak In the normal upturn in new car registrations.
Union Pacific Dividend Meeting
The chief dividend meeting on the calendar for the coming week is the session of the Union Pacific directors, scheduled for Thursday morning. A good deal of uncertainty surrounds continuance of the present payment of $1.50 quarterly. In the first quarter, Union Pacific’s net operating Income fell to $762,795, only about a third of the total for the corresponding period of 1932. While the road, in common with other carriers, has had a pick-up in business over the last five weeks, its operating income still is below that of the like period of 1932.
Union Pacific is well fortified to continue dividends at the current rate. Last year, the company reported net income equal to $7.49 a common share, and carried small balance to profit and surplus account after payment of common dividends. The road was in impregnable financial shape at the end of 1932, with
