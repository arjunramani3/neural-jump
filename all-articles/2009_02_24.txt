Stocks rebounded from Monday's losses and financial stocks soared after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a Senate committee that nationalization of major U.S. banks isn't needed.
The day after falling 251.89 points to a nearly 12-year low, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 236.16 points, or 3.3%, to close at 7350.94.
Citigroup and Bank of America, both pummeled last week amid speculation of possible government takeovers, jumped more than 20%. J.P. Morgan Chase rose 7.7% after announcing it would cut its dividend to preserve capital.
Only one of 30 Dow components fell; Microsoft slipped 0.2% after issuing a downbeat outlook for the rest of its fiscal year ending in June.
Still, traders remained on guard against a possible renewed round of selling. The Dow's rebound was its biggest since Jan. 21, the day after a 4% drop, and further declines followed. The rebound after a bigger loss on Nov. 20 lasted longer, but also faded. "I feel better now than I did three weeks ago, but this is still a bottoming process that's playing out," said Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx, a New York brokerage.
The S&P 500 rose 29.81 points, or 4%, to 773.14, erasing all the previous day's 26.72-point drop. All its sectors posted gains, led by financials, up 12.3%.
The rally began modestly in the morning even after an index of home prices showed its biggest decline in its 21-year history in the fourth quarter, and picked up speed in the afternoon.
In almost a mirror image of Monday's trading, New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks that rose outpaced those that fell by a ratio of about 6 to 1. Trading volume Tuesday was higher, as 7.1 billion shares changed hands.
Outside the financial sector, Home Depot was up 11% on a strong earnings report that bolstered hopes for retail stocks. Other retailers also posted gains.
Oil snapped two days of losses to rise nearly 4% to $39.96 a barrel. Gold slipped for the second consecutive day, falling 2.6% to $969.10 a troy ounce.
