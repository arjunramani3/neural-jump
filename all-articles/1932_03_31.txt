Union Carbide Felt Steel Conditions—(UN)
While total sales of all products by Union Carbide showed a decline last year from 1930, tbe company felt the unsatisfactory conditions In the steel Industry acutely through a reduced volume in ferro-alloys and other products connected with steel. The organization has developed new uses for products which assure a good Increase In activity when conditions return to normal. The first plant of its kind for synthetic production of butyl alcohol and butyl acetate was put in operation by Carbide last year.
Short covering caused advances in the early dealings yesterday, but after this demand had been satisfied It became evident that there was a thin market for most issues. Increased offerings in the late forenoon and early afternoon caused reactions, and while feeble technical rallies occurred at times, the trend waB downward during the remainder of the session. A factor which brought selling into the general- list was weakness in the utilities which drove that group to a new low in the averages. Another factor was weakness in the railroad list, led by Atchison. There was evidence that short covering in anticipation of greater difficulty in borrowing stocks after tomorrow had affected the technical condition.
Some talk was heard after the close that the new regulations regarding consent for lending stocks of customers might result in an upturn in today's session. Conservative observers, however, pointed out that such a development would be only technical and temporary, and continued to advise clients to take advantage of any advance to reduce long positions. They also urged the use of stop-orders for protection.
Best & Co’s. Year—(BST)
Decrease in earnings of Best & Co. for the year ended January 31, last, to $3.02 a share from $4.15 in the previous 12 months, was caused by lower price levels, a reduced volume and increased Inventory adjustments necessitated by lower wholesale prices. Sales showed the first drop Blnce 1922, amounting to 8.4%, while the net profit per dollar of sales declined to 6.70 cents, compared with 8.38 cents in the preceding year.
U. S. Smelting Buying Its Own Stock—(UV)
U. S. Smelting is another company which has been buying its own stock. Tbe company purchased 16,962 shares of its common stock last year at an average price of $14.74 a share, and in the current year about 10,000 additional shares have been bought at an average cost oi $15.95. Althougbt lower metal prices affected net earnings last year, tbe company maintained a good position. Net working capital increased to $12,555,446 from $11,646,999, and cash and U, S. government securities, as well as othor marketable securities, rose to $6,045,821 from $5,079,607 on December 31, 1930. This Inst Item was approximately 214 times all current liabilities.
Traders Bought On Balance
Professionals and floor traders were buyers on balance yesterday, although some of them sold actively at the close. Commission houses bought a little stock during the first Bet-back, but when the anticipated recovery on short covering failed to develop they became active on the selling side and the leading firms sold on balance.
Avoiding Tax Targets
The present tendency is to avoid any purchases in industries which may become targets in the coming consideration of the tax bill. Issues of companies which would suffer increased levies are likely to be affected when assessments are discussed in committees or in the House and Senate. Hope is expressed that the Senate’s action on a tax bill will not prove as disturbing as that in the House.
Granite City Steel Position— (GRU)
Cash holdings of Granite City Steel at the end of last year increased by 1215,000, to $2,540,000. As the company has no bank loans, bonded Indebtedness or preferred stock, this total is equal to nearly $10 a share on the common stock outstanding. Nel current assets were $3,800,000. or equivalent to about $14.50 a common share. While the gain in the cash item was comparatively Bmall, considerable importance is attached to it because the company paid out approximately $603,000 in dividends in 1931, while capital expenditures totaled about $400,000. Interests in the company insist it Is in a position to benefit immediately from any improvement in business.
Government Economy
Required
It is Increasingly evident that government economy is one of the necessities in the federal situation. Importance of balancing the budget is conceded on all sides, but economists realize that this cannot be expected until appropriations have been brought into closer harmony with prevailing conditions. Were It not for the presidential election this year, it is likely that question of economies would have been settled long since. As it is. there is little prospect that anything will be done in a big way in this matter until later in the year, probably after November. Washington advices to commission houses state that the leaders are aware of the situation, but are at a loss as to what to do at this time.
Public Service	■
Favored—(PUB)
Among utilities Public Service of New Jersey is favored by some advisers, due to the good reduction in operating expenses. These amounted to $51,172,438 In 1931. compared with $54.813,927 in the preceding year. Maintenance was reduced without in any way impairing the efficiency of the properties, and depreciation appropriation actually was increased, accounting for about 9% of gross, which is somewhat above the general average.

Politics Obscuring Fundamentals
At the moment, investors are likely to be influenced more by political developments than any other influence. Politics probably will continue to obscure Improvement in fundamentals. Many industrial leaders are of the opinion that spring business was checked in the past month by political uncertainty. Consumers who were interviewed were more inclined to discuss developments at Washington than prospects in their own lines. The psychology of the situation makes for continued caution.
Investors Affected by Congress	,
Action of the bond market indicates that investors are just as much disturbed by the sales tax and the failure to balance the budget as are speculative Interests here and abroad. Selling of bonds has been urgent at times, reflecting the desire of those who had accumulated to step out of the markets for the present at least.

Ball Averages
i Significant
I Significance is attached to the railroad averages by chart students. The fact that thia group entered new low territory this week it viewed as indicative of further declines in other departments. It has resulted in selling in industrials and utilities by chart followers who had only recently adopted long positions on the theory that increased resistance would be encountered as the previous lows were approached
