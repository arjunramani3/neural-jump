_ Complexion of the stock market changed overnight. .Trom a •wide, sweeping decline during the late trading ► ?th® previous session, Thursday’s opening witnessed an 'about-face with prices generally better.
. Supporting orders from strong forces were entered in tsnxmerous leading issues and their effect was visible both <fn?the tone of the market, volume of trading as well as greater steadiness and firmer prices.
u *• Strength increased as the session progressed. The '.day’s trading was 2,6v3,000 shares, about one-third less ’•'■than on Wednesday. This volume in itself furnished a •view of-the absence of extreme nervousness and hurried ‘'■selling of stocks which had characterized the two previous ; sessions.	’
Gains in leading stacks from the lows on Wednesday ’ranged from 1 to more than 2o points, the extreme improvement taking place in General Electric, which at 302 ' on Wednesday, was off m ore than SO points m a few weeks and at Thursday’s high of 3295s, had rallied nearly 28 points.
Other noteworthy gains included nearly 15 ^points in Woolworth. 12 in du Pont and Foundation Co., while American Can rallied 22 points. Pere Marquette common, among the rails, had the widest improvement, up more -	10 points from the low on Wednesday, while Nickel
' Plate improved 7 points from the previous day’s low.

The change in days was marked. Whispered talk of dire developments veered about to gossip of strong hands getting under I favorite issues. Differen^groups undoubtedly changed] their tactics from quiet Wscumulation during the dras- ] tic declines on Tuesday and Wednesday to more open -support. The Wilmington cro-«d was reported to have . been active on the buying side from the opening	I
