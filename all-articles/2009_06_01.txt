Signs of life among global manufacturers sent stocks, oil and other commodities higher, as investors gain confidence that an economic recovery is within sight.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 221.11 points, or 2.6%, to 8721.44, leaving it just under 55 points shy of positive territory for the year. Markets around the world put General Motors' long-awaited bankruptcy filing in the rearview mirror as the index hit its highest level since President Obama took office in January. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.58% to 942.87, its highest level for 2009, and is now up 4.4% for the year.
Driving stocks and commodities was news from across the globe that orders for manufactured goods were finally beginning to recover. A survey in the U.S. showed manufacturing orders picked up for the first time in 18 months. Manufacturing surveys in China, India and Europe also showed signs either of slowing declines or actual growth.
"I don't think it's a coincidence that we are seeing similar developments in many countries," said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York.
Reflecting the expectation that demand is returning as companies' stocks of goods diminish, oil prices have more than doubled since their February lows and have returned to levels last seen in early November, during a brutal market decline. Oil closed in New York up 3.42%, to $68.58 a barrel. Copper is up 85.9% from its late-December bottom.
Investors seem to be looking beyond the current recession's valleys onto the potential peaks ahead. But the rapid run-up in prices has some worried that the rally has gotten ahead of itself, especially with commodities. Energy prices have launched upward despite ample supply and refining capacity.
"Oil is overpriced," said Brian Bethune, chief U.S. financial economist at IHS Global Insight. He said investors are anticipating a return to demand that hasn't materialized yet.
Asian markets, especially those with exposure to China's economy, continued up. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 3.95% to 18888.59, its highest level since Sept. 25.
Keith Hembre, chief economist for First American Funds, based in Minneapolis, said he thinks stocks may have overshot. "It's not like I expect the market to fall off a cliff, but it may be a bit ahead of itself with regard to embedded profit expectations," Mr. Hembre said.
The rebound in manufacturing orders is a signal that companies are beginning to replenish their once-bloated supply of goods. Consumer spending has remained relatively steady in the past few months, even as manufacturing activity fell, helping to eat away the global glut of goods. Now manufacturers seem poised to restart lines in preparation to restock store shelves.
The economic good news sent U.S. Treasury bond prices down as investors, no longer satisfied parking money in safe but low-returning bonds, looked for better-yielding assets. The benchmark 10-year Treasury declined 2 1/32 points, or $20.31 per $1,000 invested, raising its yield to 3.715%.
"This market move has some real power that could take the S&P to the 1000 area," said Roger Volz, director of equities at BGC Partners in New York. But, he added, referring to the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes: "Once you get to the 3.90% area, you could start to get rate jitters in the stock market."
