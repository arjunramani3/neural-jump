apes, with charts, second		from last pape.	
The security markets put on a bright countenance yesterday. Stocks drew strength from unexpected good news on the steel industry and a sparkling rally m wheat prices. Strength in stocks was concentrated in the leaders, particularly in those intimately connected with move* meats in grain prices, like J. I. Case and International Harvester.- Case closed up 4’i points, and Harvester l~t». Railroad shares, as a group, were strong, and the steel stocks ran up at the expense of the shorts.
The bond market was strong all day. and the brisk advance in stocks put life into the late bond trading. Second-grade railroad obligations were particularly firm. In the foreign group, German issues touched new rally tops, and Argentine issues advanced.
The grain markets witnessed some exciting trading, and the highest prices since mid-No-vember. May wheat met support throughout the day at around 47%*. where resting orders had been placed, and spurted upward in the late trading, the May delivery closing at SO1-. up 21« cents. Cotton ruled a few points lower early, but it, too, recovered and closed up 9 to 15 points.
The steel news was far better than anticipated. Unfilled orders of the Steel Corp, at the year-end were down only 161 tons from the close of November, compared with estimates of a decline of as much as 30.000 tons Unfilled orders held about 2,000 tons above the low for the year, which was at the end of July’. Appearance of the news, at noon, brought a firmer tone into the market.
Buying in Rails
Steel operations, for the week ended Monday. were estimated at 15^% of capacity, up 2*'r from the previous week, which included the New Year's holiday and comparing with 12,'s% in the Christmas week. Further expansion in steel operations hinges At the moment on the automobie industry. In the final hour rally, steel stocks were as strong as :.ny group. Steel preferred which has been harboring an extensive short interest, moved up to 65’ i, up 3"\* on the day. Steel common closed at 31. up 2’4.
Railroad shares continued to meet buying. The traffic trend, from the pi esent time until late May. is unmterruptedy upward, seasonally. In both 1930 and 1931, the carriers did not get the normal seasonal upward movement in traffic, and suffered thereby. In some quarters, insistent buying in the rail stocks has been predicated on the belief that the traffic upturn this year will be of normal proportions, which would put a new face on the railroad industry. Pennsylvania continued to be the outstandingly strong spot in the rail group, but New Yofk Central , D , L & W , Southern Pacific, Union Pacific and Atchison all ranged higher. The Dow-Jone'' average of 20 railroad stock*? closed at 29 44. the highest level since November 12 when the average finished at 30 61.
The real bulge in the market came in the final hour. During the morning, stocks moved fractionally higher in light trading. Firming tendencies became more pronounced shortly after noon, but the market continued dull. Not until prices were moving up sharply did trading activity pick up. Volume of trading between 2.10 and the close reached 550,000 shares, and the tape lagged behind at times. Volume in the last 50 minutes was almost as large as it was in the first four hours and 10 minute* Transactions for the session reached 1,150 000 shares, against 930.000 Monday
Stocks in London ruled irregularly lower, with British funds firm. In Pans, the bourse was steady.
The Kreuger Audit
The final report of Price. Waterhouse & Co . official auditors, on the affairs of Ivar Kreuger and the Kreuger companies, puts a complete quietus on the arguments that Kreuger’s financial double-dealings were the result of the gieat depression. The report declares that they extended over a period of 14 years, with the personal appropriations by Kreuger reaching the amazing total of roughly $115,000,000 Even in the good years of 1923 and 1924, the fraudulent practices had achieved large proportions.
The comment accompanying the report was especially interesting, particularly that covering the methods which enabled Kreuger to carry cm his frauds The key to the whole situation was the absolute powers vested in Kreuger, giving him complete domination of the entire group of companies and of all the executive and administrative staffs. Kreuger acted—everyone else agreed.
The chief question raised by the report, and the revelations of the fraud perpetrated, is wliut steps can be taken to prevent a repetition of any similar occurrence Certainly, annual independent audits of the books of all the companies. by a single agency, would have prevented such a scandal. The Kreuger debacle is the greatest argument for full corporate publicity which the investing public has had in a long, long time.
Where the Carriers Ixxit Most Heavily
The loadings report for the full 52 weeks of 1932 reveals clearly that the carriers did not suffer their heaviest traffic losses in the freight classifications in which competition from competing services is most keen. Despite the severe competition from trucking companies, miscellaneous freight was down only 29% from 1931; less than carload merchandise was off only 18%, and livestock traffic, where the railroads have found trucking companies stiff adversaries for business, was off only 18%.
Compared with these declines, iron ore
traffic handled by the railroads was down 75.6% from 1931; lumber was off 39%. and coke was down 31.1%. Among the heavy commodities, grain and coal held up the best. Coal traffic was only 17.7% under 1931, and carload movement of grain was off 18.3%.
The drastic decline in ore movement, which was a crushing blow to such carriers as the Great Northern, reflected the decline in steel operations. However, the drop in ore traffic was more acute than the decline in steel output. Steel production for 1932 -was a little more than 50% of the total for the previous year.
The Nash Report
The Nash report for the, year ended November takes the palm for motor company statements. The company’s ability to show a profit, on the greatly curtailed volume of business it had in 1932. was little short of amazing. The company’s balance sheet, at the year-end, presented an impressively strong position. Incidentally, cash and Governmentment securities alone, at the fiscal year-end, after deducting all current liabilities, were equal to $11.72 a share on the capital stock, outstanding in the hands of the public. This is about $2 a share less than the current selling price.
Movie Seat Prices Cut
Seeking to increase attendance volume in motion picture theatres, cuts have been made by two important New York theatres. The new Radio City Music Hall has slashed prices, on its conversion from a music hall into a motion picture emporium, and the Roxy Seventh Avenue and Paramount theatres have made reductions.
The big-barrier to reducing seat prices in movie theatres has been the heavy funded debt on the theatres themselves. Unless attendance responds to the price cuts, the debts will have to be scaled down. The movie industry’, like many others, overbuilt in boom times, and is paying the price for it now.
Another Reduction
The Chase National Bank, at the annual meeting, took a step in keeping with the times by reducing the number of directors to 72 from 77. The places of five retiring directors were not filled The board still is the largest of any bank, in keeping with the position of the Chase as the largest bank in this country.
Earnings reports of leading companies, compared with those for the corresponding period a year previous, and dividend declarations compared with the previous declarations, follow. Companies reporting on a monthly basis are including, according to their latest report, and are not duplicated.
