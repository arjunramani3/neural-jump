teat u res of the market.
j&fe. ^-endon quotations gave no particular lead and a littie* uncertainty in the first few'minutes the . 4®’ showed a fairly hard tone.. Before midday, how-good deal of irregularity developed and the attempt >Ta^y U. S. Steel seemed to have met with a very small ^measure of success. The pressure in those issues was ^considerable and although there was no sign of liquida-elsewhere, it was quite sufficient to account for the —YV tone in the railroad list. The traction stocks ad-,£>r3vanced against the general current and held their im-^provement very well. In tho last hour there was renewed ^‘73P5’ossurc	S. Steel issues and the preferred in par-
was almost demoralized. The close was heavy and ^spiritless, but, except in this respect, not essentially weak. ^ •>The strength of call money did something to restrict although this would be much more of a factor £j'if the speculative account open were not so limited. The giweakness in demand sterling was about the best develop-■Cy.^nent, although the advance in the price of gold in Lon-y^don left the question of further gold imports still unset-
•	-tied. Other news developments were-of a very minor ^character.
The railroad stocks Tost ground on the day without exception in the really active issues. The decline of 1 •point in Pennsylvania was about the extreme movement. . ;The hard coalers were heavy, but the grangers and Pacifies “•'did not lose much.
. JTIk* U. S. Steel issues were, of course, tho feature of the industrial list, arid there was some evidence of pressure in the few of the minor industrial issues like Republic Steel pfd., while Amalgamated Copper lost a little
•	-ground. The tractions wore conspicuously firm through-
out, with the best advances in Metropolitan and Man-ihattan.
have represented the bear efforts of traders in part, bat specialists thought that a good dcal o'f it was plain liquidation.	.	-	. .
The trading in Steel pfd. amounted to not ypry -far •from one-half of the day's-business and with thn -t-radin^r in the common added the total was more than half.
Tennessee Coal & Iron showed a rather better tone and there is some reason to think that the liquidation in the stock for Canadian account is about over.
The Weil following is talking bearish, particularly on the Steel stocks, but seems inclined to test the strength of the support in the railroad issues.
The Tumored resignation of August Belmont, coming through Chicago, gave a heavy tone to Republic Steel pfd.
A bear point was current on Sugar based upon uncertainty as to the Cuban reciprocity treaty in Congress.
1 hiladelphia was a heavy seller of Steel preferred in the afternoon. *
'	GENER.IL INFLUENCES
London traded in something like 4.000 shares, but -ithc-se were purchases. The market on the other side was nominal, nnd transactions were purely of an arbitrage character, ceasing as s^ou as tho London exchange eloped, ‘^tenticn on tho other side was concentrated on the mining settlement in progress and there wn« no disprwi-:■ tion to take any real attitude upon American stock*. Financial advices indicated that New York was unlikely to any gold from London, but might do so from other BtiTopcan centers, as the Bank of England was evidently ...working to divert tho demand t<» Baris or Berlin.
. There was a rather belter demand for stocks in the -Ioan crowd that on Saturday, although tho higher rate for money tc< some extent disguised it. New York Central. Canadian Pnctlic and Pennsylvania were in some requestunder the ruling rate, but with these exceptions evcr> thing loaned -I ’ 2%. So far n^thc loan crowd would indicate .there is no vrrv particular short interest except perhaps in Steel pfd. Thu* would have t«> be pretty considerable to term an exou«c for bidding up the priee with 3.500.CGO sburcs of ,«toek. A short interest of 600.000 shares wouh: hardy K' a market factor.
, Some of the cr.mmi.-dor. h uncs reported limited culling ct leans but cutride.-od th.'.r it merely meant Uniting them ru tlv tru-:	mpnn-o*. '-.hi were willing enough to
lend	In nnv ca-sr*. the principal lvuuos arc carry-
ing very bttle ‘stock, and d<• nor attach milch importance to the day to; day fluctuations of menry.
The trading in bonds was rather light and only marked by <hc renewed weakness in Steel 5s. Tho investment demand for bonds conspicuous in the recent past seemed to have in a large measure died out. Gov-eminent bonds wcni rather heavy. T«»u:l sales 81,929.000.
The bond hon-os report a marked falling off in the demand ior first class bonds, which have been in considerable Tcquost for some weeks past. The supply of new bonds by Lake Shore and the mads under Pennsylvania control has materially check' d the demand.
The Imt.’es with wc-te.n connections so?m to think that Pittsburg is pretty thoroughly sold out. and after careful inquiry do not find weak spots elsewhere.
RAILWAYS.
It seems to be tho street opinion that Rock Island pfd. is very thoroughly distributed, but that the common has not found its level, and certainly has not found a resting place in the boxes of small holders. One section of the west speculative contingent is particularly bearish on the common and has been hammering it with some success. So far the Hock Island control seems to have been able to take care of itself in very trying circumstances, and has not found it necessary recently to make any market demonstration.
The early strength in the tractions was associated in tome minds with an ulterior purpose in the change of the name of the Interurban system to “the New York City." It -was a rather slim peg to hang n bull movement on, but . both B. II. T. nnd Metropolitan were bid tip with fair Success and are probably oversold.
The rumor that Manhattan will issue $5,000,000 of .-•new stock with rights to stockholders nt par may be dis: missed at once as baseless. No new stock can bo. issued be-,•?. fore January, 1906, under the terms of the subway .; guarantee.
’ The attempt to open up Baltimore ct Ohio was a failure nnd showed that the higher quotations from , 'London did not represent much actual business there.
. The mild weather and the disappointing demand for anthracite caused a little selling of tho Eric and Reading issues.
INDUSTRIALS.
A?. It looks as if development of n bear account in Amal-^gamated Copper might help that issue, but the western ly.crcwd, who arc talking lower prices, say they can borrow (.(all the stock they want to. They claim that the price is -•itoo .high on any comparison with other industrials, and ‘(/there is certainly a Boston section which believes that a £;long shut down (to the benefit of competitors) or a sur-^jrender to ITeinze are the only alternatives.
/ It is generally understood that so far as eelling bonds •.^•s concerned the operations of tho bond underwriting ^syndicate arc over, but it is thought they may still buy Steel pfd. In view of the fact that their information faon market prospects should be very good it is not considered a bull point, that they have not been more con-^spicuous buyers in tho recent past.
'V' Colorado Fuel was weak on the coal miners’ strike •^iwhivh seems to have extended further than had been cx-u(pected. There was a very poor mnrket for tho stock offering, and it is doubtful if there is 20% of tho issue in > other than those of the Standard Oil interest, tho ^Harriman peoplo and tho Osgood following.
