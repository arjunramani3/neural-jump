of $2 a share. The management still is confident that the C. & O. will cover its annual common dividend requirements of $2.50 with a small margin this year.
German Employment Increases
Figures on German unemployment, as of September 30, were mildly encouraging, for the reduction in the number of jobless in the period between June 30 and September 30 contrasted with a striking gain in the like period last year. In the third quarter this year, unemployment was reduced by about 7%, according to the figures, while in the similar quarter in 1931 it moved up a little more than 10%.
Changed statistical methods play a part in the better showing, according to word from abroad, but the Improvement can be explained fully only by the definite betterment in the business situation.
The betterment in the employment situation in Germany slight as it is, is distinctly heartening. As in other countries, unemployment doles have been a heavy drain on the German government’s funds. Greater employment will bring about a lessening of the strain, in addition to improving the morale of the country as a whole. Steel Tonnage and the Market
In the half hour before the Steel Corp.’s unfilled tonnage report appeared yesterday, the market firmed up, with pivotal stocks gaining about a point or slightly better from their previous lows.

brought little comfort to those on the constructive side of the market, for stocks crumbled under heavy selling pressure, active issues losing anywhere from a point to more than six and closing near the lows of the day. Bonds were weak, high-grade issues selling off under offerings while the more speculative issues, particularly rail bonds, dropped abruptly.

Atchison’s Loadings
While not an infallible gauge of the trend throughout the country, the Atchison loadings, for the week ended October 8, were significant. Loadings for the week were ahead of the previous week, and the drop from the like 1931 week was 18.5%, against an 19.7% decline for the week ended October 1 from the corresponding week of 1931.
If loadings for the country as a whole are in line with those of the Atchison, and record an increase in the week ended October 8 over the October 1 period, it would mean that the traffic peak was later than normal this year, with a corresponding benefit to railroad earnings.
Incidentally, the Atchison loadings figures had no immediate effect on the carrier shares. In its present mood, Wall Street is Inclined to ignore good news.
How They Stand
Earnings reports, as compared with those for the corresponding periods last year, and dividend announcements compared with the previous ones of leading companies.

selling into the market. The optimists had looked for a bigger advance, despite the assertion in authoritative quarters that the change would be only small. Shortly before the report appeared, Steel common sold at 37*4, but it faded to 35% within 10 minutes after the tonnage statement was out.
While the tonnage statement was a disappointment to the optimists, it did mark the second successive month in which the corporation’s backlog of orders has moved forward, In-
to off 2 points.
Opening transactions found most stocks higher, with Telephone selling at 105, up more than a point from Saturday’s close; Steel common at 36%, up 1%, and Union Carbide at 22%, up a quarter. United Aircraft, at 23%, was up %.
Just before the appearance of the steel tonnage report, at noon, the list firmed up, with pivotal stocks reaching the best levels of the day, and gains averaging a point or more from Saturday’s final price. Appearance of the report was the signal for heavy selling, which carried stocks off swiftly. They steadied briefly, then worked lower, with volume picking up. Short covering, near the close, served to bring about some upturn from the lows, but most issues were not far from the day’s bottom prices. Steel common, at 34%, was down a point on the day and up 1% from the low. American Telephone, which got as low as 99%, closed at par; Union Pacific, which sold as high as 64, closed at 55%. off 6% on the day, while Aircraft closed at 20%, off 2%. after selling as low as 19%.
Telephone was weak most of the session, the company’s report of its interstate business to the Interstate Commerce Commission for August bringing selling into the stock. The showed that operating income for the was down 42% from August, 1931.
*	Day^ Nows' Good /
The day's news hardly was calculated turb the markets, for it was largely on the constructive side. The Texas Railroad Commission ordered a curtailment of oil production in the state, which, it is estimated, should cut down produetjon by, roughly, 100,000 barrels dally. The step should avert the necessity of a reduction in crude oil prices in the area which had been threatened.
Atchison’s loadings were better than anticipated, but Atchison common was weak, losing 5% on the day and closing at 36, only fractionally above the uottom.
The dollar appreciated in European money markets, in contrast to its recent "weakness. Soft coal output figures showed an improvement of 7r/r over the previous week. Anthracite output was up 42% from the previous week, and for the first time in months, production war above the similar 1931 week.
While trading was light in the first hour, volume picked up when stocks turned weak. Trading for the day was 2,300,000 shares, large in view of the absence from the floor of a number of traders, due to the religious holiday.
The market in Paris was lower. In London, bonds held firm, but stocks were Irregularly lower.
Chesapeake Corp. Structure Strengthened
Moves to strengthen the financial structure of Chesapeake Corp., which were put in motion early this year, are bearing fruit. The corporation’s position, as of October 1, was decidedly better than at the close of 1931, and the improvement is reflected particularly in the decline in the amount of the corporation's funded and unfunded debt outstanding.
As of October 1, the principal amount of the Chesapeake Corp.'s convertible, collateral 5% bonds outstanding had been pared down tn $43,683,000, against $44,495,000 at the end of 1931, through operation of the sinking fund. A total of $812,000 principal amount of the bonds had been retired, and the corporation, on October 1, held $235,000 principal amount in the treasury for sinking fund purposes.
The reduction in the corporation’s unfunded debt has been more substantial. As of October 1, it stood at roughly $31,550,000, including a small item of secured accounts payable, a cut of $3,800,000 from the December 31 figure. Actual bapk loans are $31,500,000, and the latest payment made to reduce them was about a week ago. of $500,000. The reduction this year has been $1,000,000 in this item. The biggest cut has been in secured'Ticcounts payable.
The company, as of October 1, held 4,066,508 shares of Chesapeake & Ohio Railway common, about 27,500 shares less than at the year-end. The stock was sold early in 1932, at in the neighborhood of $30 a share. Proceeds of the sale of this stock was applied to cutting down the secured accounts payable.
The corporation has been able to conduct Its sinking fund operations profitably this year, due to the low prices for its bonds, or Instance, in the first six months of the year, profit on bonds purchased and tendered to ^the sinking fund was roughly $164,000. The $235,000 principal amount of bonds which the corporation held on October 1 for the sinking fund cost only roughly $136,000. These profits are carried to surplus, but they represent a big saving in cash outgo for the corporation.
The Chesapeake Corp, is almost entirely dependent for income on dividends from its holdings of Chesapeake & Ohio Railway common. Net income of the C. * O. in the first eight months of the year was equal to $1.60 a share on C. & O. common stock, and for the ^nlne months ended September, preliminary estimates indicate that net income was equal to just short
