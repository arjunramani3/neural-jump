PEACE TALK SMASHES PRICES
Germany’s proposal results in semipanic—Losses run into large figures tn neaMy every department of the market— No heed paid to real values or to likelihood that Allies will reject terms.
Sales, 2,459,600 shares.
What professional traders, whether large or** small, had been unable to achieve to theirv eatisfaction in the past ten days, the firman Government accomplished in a few brief moments. The mere suggestion of a willingness to discuss terms of peace as announced, by the German Chancellor sent prices in the stock market to low levels that the most optimistic bears had not looked for. For the moment no cognizance was taken of the obvious fact that the Allies would reject any possible terms of peace proposed by Germany. Just the word “peace’’ from official source produced a selling movement, partly from the bear element, who grasped the opportunity for a re-entrance into the market at a lower level, and partly from a public wnicn is imbued with the belief that present prosperity in America is due entirely to the war calamity of Europe. All sense of proportion and of purely domestic trade conditions were lost to sight, and the result was a rush to *ell stocks.	_	,
One theory advanced was that Germany, in seizing on the conquest of Rumania and the hurried preparations made by the Allies for a change of war plans, through; reconstruction of cabinets and simplification of adminis-! trative details, was bolstered up by either the idea or the, assurance that Russia might make a separate peace. This view was based on the idea that England cannot very well go on -with the financing of her northern ally. It
overlooked the fart that Russia is now shipping gold to this country in large Quantities, independently of England; also the fact that England has shown no signs of wenlvning its financial support for all the Allies, and of the further fact that the German peace proposal includes segregation of Poland from the Russian Empire, as well as an entopment of Rnfwia’g ambition of centuries, viz.: ponnen^ion of the Dardanelles, and of free entrance to the Mediterranean.
Germany’s proposal of peace comes now after the conquest of Rumania, which has shortened the German lines 650 miles, released 750/100 men, and increased the available tonnage of foodstuffs, both animal and vegetable. German submarines and mine layers have in forty days sunk 130 ships, three-quarters of which were British, having a tonnage of 270,720, and an estimated value of $135,360,000.	'	.
The new British cabinet may mean concessions to tBig country on account c£ black list and Intel ference with the mails. Great Britain has prohibited the import of manufactured and unmanufactured gold except to the Bank of England. This will prevent further shipments to private sources 'from this country. Transvaal’s October gold output was $16,825,000, the third largest month since the war. and compares with an absolute record output of $17,643,000 in the month of March 1912. An item that tends to better distribution of land in England is the fact that 2.000,000 acres of land belonging tothe British aristocracy are for sale. A “back-to-the-land” movement is coming in all European countries. Higher meat prices are predicted in this country and Great Britain, owing to the drought in Argentine and Uruguay which resulted in the death of 20*%> of the cattle raised. •
Call money dropped to 4*6 per cent. High call money rates are now predicted in well-informed quarters till after the New Year. High call rates will induce brokers to put j the bulk of their Stock Exchange loans into six months' Ioans, with consequent higher interest rates for speeula-: tors. The banker will make more money that way. Until recently the bulk of the loans were carried on call.
Weak at opening
The bear element held possession of the market at the opening, and pushed prices downward in nearly every quarter. An exception was Central Leather, which moved up % to 111*6; Pressed Steel Car gained 1*6 to 83^ and Atlantic. Gulf & West Indies, which repeated the tactics of Monday morning, selling up 1% to 143, although still 2 points below the Monday opening.
Declines become general
While some support appeared in the coppers and steel issues, sufficient to stop the decline for the time being at least, there was no evidence of any purpose on the part of the big interests to reverse the market’s turn. The Manna controversy was used as an excuse for bear attacks, although the'precedent of the Lusitania case would indicate months of correspondence "before any diplomatic crisis would bo reached.
i Selling; on peace proposal*
Sentimental effect of the German peace proposal* caused prices to melt pwav as soon as the Street read the ticker announcement. No time was taken to digest the situation. The hears proceeded to extend their attacks on prices, and the operators m commission house* dropped their holdings as if peace really were assured, and a- if peace would necessarily be detrimental to values. Losses extended frpm two to four points, and in *omc case* oven more.
Some recoveries from extreme low
Towards the close of the second hour the semi-panic in the market came to a halt and in some' cases prices recovered from the extreme declines. In the meantime the energetic operations of the *bears. the uncovering of stop loss orders, and the unloading of stocks by timid holder-had brought about still further recessions. Even Central Leather collap-ed io 106**. off 41-. and Pittsburgh Coal, which had been living on expectations and sunposea con' tracts, had declined 4%. to 49.
Bearish sentiment
The market behaved, on the whole, like a flock of sheep following a leader through a break in the fence. Sane reasoning indicated that peace proposals coming from Germany would not be accepted by the Allies with their new alignment of administrative efficiency both m England and France and with prospects of similar action in Italy. Neither was it made clear how peace, the most desired thing in all the world at present, would work to the disadvantage of American enterprise. Within the last two weeks, it was argued that cessation of purchases from the United States by the Allies would make possible the revival of domestic business for equipment and other concerns which are at present largely devoting thmr attention to war orders. Peace at present, if such a thing were possible, would not mean discontinuanc o' tho production of supplies for nations at a truce. Neither would peace in a year, but the market followed the timid ones through tho break in the fence.
Trading in the first two hours passed a total of a million shares.
Recessions in special issue*
1 In the early afternoon there was a penend stiength-: cning of prices from the extreme decline, accompan.od hj , some further recessions in special issues. Industrial Alcohol. always a volatile security, showed a los> of over 7 points at 128%. Ckiba Cane declined to 59 xl, and Ken-necott sold a* low a-- 51x^ with Westinghouse at 56 V.-. Chandler Motor showed a loss of 5 points, and Anaconda got dangerously near to 90 with Inspiration off nea-ly 5 points. International Paper common. American Smelting* Zinc and Colorado Fuel ranged from 2 to 4 points below the closing level, before support appeared and new bux-ing started prices upward.
Wesiern selling; Mill expected
One of the strongest features in the situation was Canadian Pacific, which advanced neurly 2 points to 107. The coal roads held ther own '.omnaratix ely well, and New York Cental and Union Pacifiv showed far less xxeas-ness than the industrial issues. The bears continued to pound the market and with the elimination of many long accounts the technical position became much stronger. Early selling through the wire houses was necessarily accomplished without knowledge in the Middle and Fur West of the specific cause for the xveakness in New Y'ork. and it is presumed that further liquidation from that quarter, when the day’s news reaches there, xvill serve for the time being to counteract tho buying now in ex*i-dence locally.
Low point* of day readied
An avalanche of selling overwhelmed the market in the late trading and drove prices to the lowest point of recent weeks. United States Steel sold close to 118, Utah dropped below 114, and Anaconda to 8914. Central Leather, after its recent demonstration of Strength, touched 1(11 and American Beet Sugar sold nt par.' Industrial Alcohol declined over 14 points from Monday’s high, and ex*en Union Pacific had to give way a point. Marine common went off nearly 5 points, with a large decline m the preferred. Cuba Cane Sugar sold below 57 and Pressed Steel Car showed a loss of 5 points. Over 2,000,000 shares had been traded in before 2:30. The late activity was evidently due to xvire orders from the West, as well as to sacrifices of stockholdings for the benefit of wheat speculators, who were obliged to make a quick scramble for funds. Call money was easier.
