Pipelines were the session's best performer, led by a 93-cent, or 88%, surge to 1.99 by large cap Williams Cos. (NYSE) after the Tulsa, Okla., energy company settled with the telecommunications unit it spun off, Williams Communications. The agreement gives Williams Cos. $225 million in cash, a $100 million note and release from potential lawsuits by bondholders and Williams Communications. Williams Cos. isn't out of the woods, however, as the company is still trying to secure a credit line of at least $1 billion.
NRG and its parent, Xcel, both hit 52-week lows on the NYSE. NRG plunged 56%, or 2.76, to 2.20, while big-cap utility Xcel dropped 25%, or 1.89, to 5.66. The moves came partly on news that Xcel is being investigated by federal agencies over its energy-trading activities, and also in part from S&P's downgrade of NRG's debt to junk status. In the wake of the downgrade, NRG now has 15 days to post between $975 million and $1.1 billion in cash collateral to support its revolving lines of credit and other obligations.
Technip-Coflexip (NYSE) lost 14%, or 2.94, to 18.51 after S&P revised its outlook on the Paris petroleum engineering and processing concern to negative from stable. S&P said the revised outlook reflects "lower-than-expected forecasts for operating performance in 2002," resulting primarily from delays in delivering certain contracts.

NEW YORK -- Small-cap stocks surged, with the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 Index marking the biggest percentage and point gain in its seven-year history. The Russell 2000 Index of small-cap stocks was no slouch either, posting some of its strongest-ever point and percentage rises.
Credit broad buying for the surge. For the first time in memory, gains were posted by all 86 of the industry groups that Dow Jones follows.
That means semiconductors were in lockstep with lodging stocks. Wireless communications were moving alongside casinos. The move was unusual; it's much more common for investors to pick certain sectors and bore in on them when they are in a buying mood.
"This was a positive development," said Bob O'Brien, head of trading at Evergreen Investments. "It was real investing," not an overwhelming move by big program traders.
The movement shows that when gains can hold, like they generally have since the market's big rally last Wednesday, "it piques people's interest," Mr. O'Brien said. "But I'm still expecting choppiness for some time to come, so there may be some giveback as we proceed."
The Russell 2000 gained 18.55 points, or 4.9%, to 400.81, and the S&P 600 rose 10.81, or 5.6%, to 203.75. The rise was better than the point and percentage record the S&P 600 set on Oct. 31, 2000, when it rose 9.97 points, or 4.8%. The Nasdaq Composite Index also had a stellar day, rising 73.13, or 5.8%, to 1335.25.
Pipelines were the session's best performer, led by a 93-cent, or 88%, surge to 1.99 by large cap Williams Cos. (NYSE) after the Tulsa, Okla., energy company settled with the telecommunications unit it spun off, Williams Communications. The agreement gives Williams Cos. $225 million in cash, a $100 million note and release from potential lawsuits by bondholders and Williams Communications. Williams Cos. isn't out of the woods, however, as the company is still trying to secure a credit line of at least $1 billion.
Power company AES (NYSE) rose 64 cents, or 41%, to 2.20 after the Arlington, Va., company, which has been connected with struggling Williams, issued a statement saying the companies' operations aren't "deeply intertwined."
Advertising also had a strong day, with small-cap gainers including DoubleClick, up 37 cents, or 7.7%, to 5.20, R.H. Donnelley (NYSE) up 1.14, or 5%, to 23.99 and Advo (NYSE) ahead 75 cents, or 2.2%, to 34.95.
The poorest performers were water utilities, but small caps bucked the trend with Philadelphia Suburban (NYSE) ahead 1.20, or 6.5%, to 19.55.
Investors also did minimal dabbling in electric utilities, making them the second-poorest performers. Among small-caps on the NYSE, Black Hills fell 39 cents, or 1.6%, to 23.61, while Dynegy jumped 52 cents, or 76%, to 1.20 after agreeing to sell its 16,500-mile pipeline to Warren Buffet for $928 million in cash and the assumption of $950 million of debt.
Metris of St. Louis Park, Minn., was a big NYSE percentage gainer, almost doubling for a second consecutive session with a 47%, or 1.35, gain to 4.20. The move came on reports that Congress might soon approve a long-awaited bankruptcy bill that is seen as beneficial to credit-card companies because it would make it more difficult for individuals to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.
Charter Communications Class A shares surged 37%, or 97 cents, to 3.61 on word the St. Louis cable company's chairman, Paul G. Allen, is considering a number of moves to significantly increase his stake and perhaps even take the company private, according to executives briefed on the deliberations, the New York Times reported yesterday.
Telecommunications companies were also among the best performers, with Telus (NYSE) up 21%, or 77 cents, to 4.37 after the Burnaby, British Columbia, provider of communications services maintained its financial forecast for this year, using earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization and said it expects cash flow to be positive by 2003.
Alexander & Baldwin had a solid day, with the Honolulu marine transport firm rising 10%, or 2.31, to 24.95.

obligations.
Benthos, among the smallest of the small with a market cap of just $6.3 million, fell 17%, or 80 cents, to 3.80 after the North Falmouth, Mass., oceanography-equipment supplier posted solid fiscal third-quarter profit but said coming performance will be challenging.
Technip-Coflexip (NYSE) lost 14%, or 2.94, to 18.51 after S&P revised its outlook on the Paris petroleum engineering and processing concern to negative from stable. S&P said the revised outlook reflects "lower-than-expected forecasts for operating performance in 2002," resulting primarily from delays in delivering certain contracts.
