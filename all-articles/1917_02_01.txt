GERMAN NOTE CAUSES SEVERE
BREAK IN STOCK MARKET
Trading Orosses £jOOO,O0GShare Level With Prices Off
3 to 13 Points in Active Stocks—Early Weakness Followed by Moderate Rallies
With transactions exceeding the 2,000,000-share mark the stock market Thursday recorded one of the most severe breaks in prices of the series of such weak markets that have punctuated the last two years, mostly predicated on I fears of a break with Germany. Majority of the low ' prices were made in the first quarter of hour's trading. While opening price! were at average reranirions of ftcm ! 3 to 15 pointe in the most active issues, the low figures were reached on succeeding sales.
mercantile Marine preferred was the most severely hit of all the active issues with a loss of 17% points Mt the low level of 65 made in a split opening. United States Steel showed a loss of from seven to 12 points on the first sales. In few cases were the low prices greatly below the opening, the most conspicuous exception being Utah Copper which after opening at 104 or 7% points below the preceding close lost seven points more, making a gross loss of 14%.
Nothing counted in the price movement, but the German note announcing an unrestricted submarine campaign. Values went for nothing as thinly margined accounts were wiped out and alarmed holders of stocks sought to save what they could from the wreckage.
Only moderate rallies were recorded in the industrial sharers, which had to bear the brunt of the selling. Recoveries were little better than one-third to one-fourth of the gross losses in th? active stocks, while in the case of less active issues the closing was at the day^s low or only fractionally higher. Large declines occurred in the railroad shares even though they had not been for months as great features of speculation as had the industrial shares.
