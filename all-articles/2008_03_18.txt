The same brokerage firms that weighed down the stock market Monday rallied yesterday as the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates and two brokers reported earnings.
The turnaround session, which included a 420.41-point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, was starkest for Lehman Brothers Holdings. Shares in the brokerage surged $14.74, or 46%, to $46.49, its biggest gain ever, after two straight days of selling, as it reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates. The stock now sits around where it closed on Thursday, before it was beset by chatter that it would face a liquidity crunch similar to that Bear Stearns.
Shares of Goldman Sachs Group rose 24.57, or 16%, to 175.59 as its first-quarter profit of $1.51 billion, or $3.23 a share, was well above analysts' expectations.
Among other companies whose shares had been dumped on fears of a liquidity crunch, MF Global rose 2.12, or 35%, to 8.17 after the futures and options brokerage told employees that rumors about its capital position were "entirely unfounded."
Inter-dealer broker GFI Group (Nasdaq) rose 7.07, or 14%, to 58.08. The broker facilitates trade of credit-default swaps, which have traded in high volumes during the recent credit crisis.
Commodities-futures house FCStone Group (Nasdaq) rallied 9.56, or 45%, to 31.
Even Bear Stearns attracted buyers. Its shares climbed 1.10, or 23%, to 5.91. It was unclear how many of those buyers had borrowed the stock "short" and were buying it back to close out the bet. According to Data Explorers, which tracks short positions, loans of the stock peaked last week at 54% of the total available for borrowing.
Citigroup was the largest percentage gainer on the Dow, rising 2.09, or 11% to 20.71. Washington Mutual rose 1.36, or 15%, to 10.60.
Mortgage lenders, long market pariahs, also returned to favor, at least for one session. Fannie Mae added 6.01, or 27%, to 28.22 on reports that U.S. regulators may ease capital constraints on the government-supported lenders. Freddie Mac rose 5.40, or 26%, to 26.02.
Outside the financial sector Yahoo (Nasdaq) rose 1.81, or 7%, to 27.66 after the Internet search-engine company reiterated its belief that it is poised for stronger growth and that Microsoft's offer was undervaluing it.
Amgen (Nasdaq) fell 1.87, or 4.3%, to 41.21 after Roche Holding agreed to pay its biotechnology rival a higher royalty fee than it previously proposed in an effort to get an anemia drug onto the market. Amgen is asking for an injunction against the drug in the U.S.
FactSet Research Systems added 7.90, or 18%, to 52.43 after the provider of financial-market-analysis software posted fiscal second- quarter earnings growth.
