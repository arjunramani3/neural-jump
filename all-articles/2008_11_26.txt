Thank the government for the festive stock gains.
Stocks rose Wednesday for the fourth consecutive session, the first such run for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since April, as investors bet on a government bailout for General Motors and hoped the worst of the financial crisis was over.
Dow component GM rose $1.25, or 35%, to $4.81. Deutsche Bank said it is looking more likely the nation's two largest auto makers, GM and Ford Motor, will get a bailout. The analyst said the car makers won't waste the opportunity to present a turnaround plan to Congress after the holiday. Ford added 49 cents, or 30%, to 2.15.
American depositary shares of Toyota Motor shed 59 cents to 65.14 after Fitch Ratings cut its credit rating on the auto maker, citing slowing car sales in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 247.14 points, or 2.91%, to 8726.61 for its first four-session rally since April 18, to finish up 17% from its nadir last week. It was the biggest four-session percentage gain for the Dow since August 1932, around the nadir of a historic bear market.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500 rose 30.39, or 3.53%, to 887.68. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite added 67.37, or 4.6%, to 1532.10.
The government's moves to rescue Citigroup and spur the mortgage and credit-card financing markets finally brought calm to the banking sector this week, and that drew buyers back to stocks.
"The rot has stopped," said one trader at a midsize Wall Street firm. "Now, everybody's got to go back to the drawing board and put a new value on assets."
Still, this week's rally, like many bear-market rallies, was distorted by short-sellers forced to buy back bets against stocks , the trader said.
"You got a big scramble," the trader said. "All the low-price, heavily shorted stuff -- that's what went up the most."
Stocks rose despite dismal economic data. Orders for durable goods fell by 6.2% in October, while personal consumption fell by 1%, indicating that both businesses and consumers slowed spending. Weekly unemployment claims implied that the job market contracted again in November.
Shares of Bell Canada parent BCE fell 10.65, or 34%, to 20.63. The $42 billion takeover of BCE, which was set to be one of the largest leveraged buyouts ever, was thrown in jeopardy after an auditor warned it couldn't sign off on a clause requiring BCE be solvent after taking on debt incurred in the transaction.
Stocks related to the commodities sector surged, despite recent signs that the downturn in energy and materials prices will be prolonged.
Deere rose 2.66, or 8%, to 35.76 even as the tractor maker warned earnings would dip in 2009 as the weakening global economy threatened to end the five-year boom in farm-equipment sales.
Tiffany tacked on 8 cents to 20.91 after the seller of jewelry and other gifts cut its earnings outlook for the fiscal year and said it would lay off staff to reflect weaker consumer demand.
Rally Results Key facts about the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the past four sessions' advance: The DJIA is up 1,174.32 points, or 15.55%, over the past four days. The four-session streak is the longest for the Dow since the one that ended April 18. It is the biggest four-session point gain ever, and biggest in percentage terms since the gain that ended Aug. 8, 1932. On Wednesday, ahead of the holiday, the DJIA was up 247.14 points, or 2.91% to 8726.61. The Dow remains down 5,437.92 points, or 38.39%, from the record close of 14164.53 on Oct. 9, 2007.
