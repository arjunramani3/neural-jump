Heartened by the support accorded stocks at around the early October lows, new buying came into the markets yesterday resulting’ in a good rally. The close found stocks up as much as 5 points, with most of the pivotal industrial and rail shares 2 or 3 points higher than Thursday’s final quotations. Volume of trading was approximately 1,000,000 shares, and stocks eased from their highs in the late trading.
otrengtn in stocks was accompanied by firmer prices for bonds, particularly the rail issues, which have been hit severely recently. Wheat turned around and ran up close to 2 cents a bushel, but closed with a gain of only 1%. Cotton was up 15 to 17 points, losing some of its early recovery.
The market was firm from the start, but overnight gains were generally not large. As the morning wore on, however, the list drew strength from wheat’s recovery and the better tone in the bond market. The day’s best prices were witnessed in the early afternoon, the late wave of profit-taking bringing recessions. Some of the gains from Thursday’s lows were very sharp. Union Pacific, for instance, sold close to 65, up more than 7 points from the bottom price Thursday. Atchison was another stellar performer among the rails, and Allied Chemical, Telephone and American Can were in demand among the pivotal industrials.
Stocks of companies which would benefit from a return of beer went on a spree. Owens Illinois Glass furnished the fireworks in this group, closing at the day’s top of 34^*, up 5U. Canada Dry and Crown Cork and Seal, among the low priced stocks, scored gains of a point or more. The gold mining company shares, the ^spectacular performers Thursday, did no better than hold their own.
The routine business nows was in a similar vein to that of the previous days of the week. The chain store sales reports covering October were uniformly unfavorable, indicating that the decline in sales for the month had been larger than for the ydar to date. Trade reviews, on the other hand, were more cheerful in tenor
In both Pans and London, the markets were irregular. British bonds sagged slightly lower.
Poker Game in Oil
cut by 45,000 shares the potential amount of common that might be outstanding. The company plans to issue new bearer warrants for the warrants attached to the preferred to be redeemed. The new warrants will carry the same privileges of subscription to common as those attached to the preferred.
Bank Statements
This week’s bank statements are much more encouraging than they appear at first glance. The very moderate increase in borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank, amounting to ^12,-000,000, in the past two weeks, is a normal seasonal development and canncrt be interpreted as indicating a reversal of trend or deterioration in the banking picture. Likewise, the $32,000,000 Increase in currency circulation is anything unfavorable and, in fact, was a smaller rise than would be expected over the month-end. In the past two weeks there has been a net decline of $5,000,000 in circulation, where in all recent years there has been a substantial rise at this period. Member bank reserve balances were off $28,000,000, but this was also a seasonal move and a smaller than usual drop.
Banks in New York continued to expand their credits. - Total loans and investments rose $16,000,000 to $6,998,000,0000, the highest since early January, and 8713.000.000 above the year’s low. The contraction of security and business loans appears practically to have run its course in New York. Since mid-July security loans have declined only $72,000,000, against a drop of $575,000,000 from January 6 to July 20-

Now High and	Lows	
Friday, on the New York Stock Exchange, four stocks (Commercial Credit	preferred,
Crown Cork common and preferred, and 'White Motor ctfs.) made new highs, and one stock (Owens-Illinois Glass) made a new low, for the year 1932.
Competition for the properties of the Richfield Oil Co. of California is keen, with the rival bidders raising one another as the game progresses Bids have climbed sharply from the original figure suggested, to the benefit of holders of Richfield securities. They are vitally interested, but inactive, participants.
Richfield went into receivership early m 1931 The first move in the game to acquire the property was the acquisition by Cities Service erf large blocks of common and preferred stocks, and subsequently of the prior obligations. Then the Getty interests offered a plan.	__
Next the Consolidated Oil Corp., representing the Sinclair interests, stepped in with an offer to acquire the property for 180,000 shares, $100 par, of 6% non-voting preferred stock. This was later increased.
Standard of California came into the picture with what was regarded as a better offer, and Consolidated now has raised the ante again. The Richfield Bank Creditors’ committee if working for acceptance of the Standard offer.
Standard is eager to acquire the Richfield properties to prevent entry of a new element into the Coast area. Consolidated would like to get an important position in the territory Cities Service’s interests would be served best by continuation of the receivership.
While the bidding has been going on, Richfield Oil 6s have rallied from the year’s low of 6 to around 33, a new year high.
Estimating the Trade Fick-Up
One of the weekly trade reviews declares that the undercurrent of business revival is becoming stronger each week, and that increases which formally were held to be only seasonal upturns now give evidence of being permanent achievements in a definite forward movement. Some test of whether this forecast is correct should be forthcoming when the election is removed as a factor influencing business.
Certainly, for some companies the business improvement was sustained through October. Westinghouse Electric, for example, showed an increase in sales of industrial equipment in September and this was continued in October. Appliance sales showed a slight gain in October over September.
Recent instances of improvement in business have not been accompanied by the sustained publicity given such reports in tbe late summer, but they have been quite numerous.
Sentence
Foreigq^rs are more accustomed to seeing prominent business men receive heavy sentences for breaches of trust thai are Americans, so the stiff penalty meted out to one of the Swedish director of the Krueger enterprises probably will be less startling abroad than here. After their surprise at the onc-year prison term, Americans will be Interested to know whether Sven Holdt can pay the fine of 337,500,000 French francs imposed.
The courts act quickly abroad. Hatry, Lord Kylsant and now Holdt are among the prominent European business men who have paid speedily for their business misdeeds. They set an example that numerous investors would like to have followed by the American courts.
United Aircraft
Redemption of 30,000 shares of United Aircraft preferred on January 1 will not after all.
