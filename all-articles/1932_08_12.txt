International Harvester and Standard Oil of New Jersey.
The nationalization of industry by Russia seriously affected Singer, as the company owned extensive lumber tracts, iron mines and factories in Russia. This investment, va tied at $84,300,000, was written off Singer’s books in 1920. International Harvester lost in the neighborhood of $45,000,000 in Russia. The total includes money in banks, receivables, a certain amount of inventory and the Russian factory.
So far as any closer relations between the United States and Russia arc concerned, the State Department in "Washington has laid down the principle that a pre-iequisitc to the establishment of diplomatc relations with the present Russian government was recognition uf the rights of private property owners. The recognition of this principle, even in part, by the Soviets would mean much financially to panies whose properties were taken over out compensation.

The estimate that the net uk.oin»‘ of the Atchison in July would be sufficient to offset the loss reported for the first six months of the jear. and put the ro.ui in black for the ‘ first seven month*, is one straw that Indicates how quickly a turnabout can come.

Northern Pacific has made a poor showing, dur to the heavy slump in its traffic. For the first six months, the road had an operating deficit of $1,521,640, and the net loss lor the period wa* $4,782,089.	i
In the three years ended 1931, Northern Pa- I cific earned roughly 53r; of total groas revenues in the last six months of each year. In the same three years, net operating income in ' tbe final half year constituted 73r< of the three- [ year total The greater percentage of increase in net railway operating income earned in the i last half, a* compared with the advance in 1 gross, js due tn the fact that operating costs, m the first half are generally higher than in the final six month’	*
This year, Northern Pacific undoubtedly will 1 be benefited substantially by a heavier crop movement than in the final six months of lfidl Last year, even wi~i the poor crops, Northern' Pacific reported net railway opeiating income of $6,801,420 for the full year, as compared with net operating income of only $1,098,095 in the first six month*. Higher commodity prices should bring heavier inbound freight traffic.
The possibilities of a striking change in the Northern Pacific picture illustrate what could happen to the radroad situation generally. The advance in Northern Pacific capital stock from the low of r>«_. to current level* of around is is basrd on the hope that such the picture will occur.
