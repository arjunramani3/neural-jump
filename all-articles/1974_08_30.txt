Abreast of the Market
An Appraisal—
By Victor J. Hillexy
Many money managers agree that the stock market's staggering drop last month made it ripe for a substantia! rally, but they question how much staying power such an upswing will have.
Before it spurted 21.74 points Friday to
678.58,	the Dow Jones industrial average had plunged 140.72 points in 16 sessions.
H.	Alden Johnson Jr., senior vice president of Massachusetts Financial Services Inc., which shepherds $2.6 billion in six mutual funds and private investment accounts, says the market is “oversold and could rebound as much as 10%.*’ But he also thinks such an advance will wilt later as investors step back to assess “how well the unraveling of the nation's economic problems proceeds.”
One thing they’ll be watching closely, he says, is the expected inventory correction. Their concern also will be focused on the “slowdown of all the world's economies after having all inflated together.” In addition, he asserts, investors will be eyeing the recycling of Arab oil dollars and the efforts to curb inflation.
In his view, "the U.S. will have to become a lender of last resort, funneling Middle East oil dollars we get to other foreign countries being hurt by the high oil prices.”
Current stock prices, he believes, "have discounted the worst” of all those problems plaguing the U.S. economy. They haven’t, however, discounted "any severe crack in the financial system,” but he considers such a development unlikely.
Inflation, Mr. Johnson suggests, should begin receding early next year. And this ebbing, he adds, would have a "positive” effect on the market even with corporate earnings in a decline. The price-earnings multiple of stocks will improve, he thinks, as investors look forward to an economic recovery late in 1975 and a further rise in multiples in 1976 as well as an upswing in profits.
Cash Reserves of About 9%
The $1.2 billion Massachusetts Investors Trust, he says, has cash reserves of about 9% "and we’re starting to reduce them.” Its aim, he explains, is for a portfolio 45% invested in basic Industries, such as aluminums, oils, chemicals, papers, steels, coppers and airlines; 45% in growth stocks, mainly in the technology area, and 10% in interest-sensitive stocks, such as fire and casualty-insurance issues.
Another investment officer who regards the market as "sold out" and near a turn over the short term is Albert L. Zesigcr, president of BEA Associates Inc., which guides investments of $325 million. “The market now'is in an emotional stage, with institutions panicking,” he asserts. But even though “the end of the downturn could be near in many groups,” he says, a sustained market recovery will be slow because, "for the first time in this generation, the economy has some major structural problems and it will take several years to work out of them.”
But he's “encouraged to see some response to these problems” of inflation, high interest rates and illiquidity as the economy shows signs of slowing. He notes cutbacks in capital-spending plans, construction and auto output. And he expects to see some inventory cutting.
BEA, Mr. Zesiger notes, has been “buying longer-term bonds of the highest quality, with the largest positions in government and government-guaranteed issues.” In its stock purchases, it’s continuing to invest in stocks "with high yields, some of 8%, and histories of dividend increases on the order of 10% a year.” It likes resources stocks such as domestic oils, natural gas and uranium issues.
Basic positions in "high-quality equities” are being maintained by Bank of the Southwest, which manages about $700 million, says Mont C. Draper, vice president and senior portfolio manager. But it also is

"holding and continuing to accumulate short-term reserves," which "vary according to requirements, but are in general substantial."
Current Investor psychology "Is probably lower than at the bottom of 1970's bear market," asserts Eugene Sit, vice president and senior portfolio manager of Investors Diversified Services Inc. He says the industrial average now is selling at about one time the book value ot its 30 component companies; this compares with
1.1	times at the bottom of the market breaks in 1970 and 1938. He adds that in December 1965 the average sold at 2.2 times book value.
“We believe that the outlook for inflation and interest rates will be much improved in the coming months as we experience slower economic growth,” he states. Fluctuating Money Market Rates
Michael K. Evans, president of Chase Econometrics Associates Inc., still believes "strongly that the economy will recover in 1975.” His prediction is for a 1.5% increase in real gross national product on a yearly average basis, with the quarterly rate averaging over 2% for the first half and over 5% for the second half. He looks for a rise "even if the capital-goods boom doesn’t fully materialize next year.” He also sees inventory investment declining from $14 billion to $5 billion by the end of 1975, but then stabilizing.
Money market rates for at least another year “are likely to fluctuate in a range of 8% to 12%" and "hopefully, before the end of 1974, will begin to move gradually to the lower end of that range,” contends Edward M. Syring Jr., vice president and economic research director of Marine Midland Bank. He’s forecasting a drop in banks’ prime lending rate, currently 12%, to around 10%% by year-end and a further slide to 8%% by the close of 1975. Yields of corporate bonds of investment quality, he adds, aren’t likely to fall' much, if any, "below 9% during the next two years because of the inflation rate we expect to prevail over the period.”
