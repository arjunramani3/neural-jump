Stocks’ 222-Point Fall Reinforces Fears on 1998
By Suzanne McGee
Staff ReDorter of The Wall Street Journal
The first few days of 1998 were nerveracking for stock-market investors.
The past few have been agonizing.
In a turbulent finale to a painful week for bulls, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday plunged 222.20 points, or 2.911, to 7580.42. The decline, the fourth-largest ever in points but not historic in percentage terms, brought the Dow’s losses for the first six trading days of the year to 327.83 points, or 4.27c. All 30 stocks in the index fell, shaving S54.5 billion in market capitalization off the index. None of the 128 Dow Jones industry groups of the overall market posted a gain. For every stock on the New York Stock Exchange that managed to advance during an unusually heavy trading day, nearly five declined.
The bloodshed during what has traditionally been one of the market's strongest periods - January - reinforced fears that 1998 will be the first year since 1990 that the blue-chip index hasn’t recorded a gain in its first month of a new year.
"I think this is going to be a pretty tough year,” said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Funds in Boston. "After three-straight years of good returns, the scenario that produced those is very much in question. Investors are really worried by the market panic in Indonesia.”
So far this year, there has been little
positive news to reassure investors. Many companies have warned of earnings disappointments, and analysts have trimmed their ratings and forecasts on more. Since the reporting season doesn't get under way for a week, there is little good news to offset this. Meanwhile, the news on Southeast Asia’s economic turmoil continues to worsen, with a different country hitting the headlines each week.
(Several Asian markets fell on Monday morning. Hong Kong fell particularly hard, with the Hang Seng blue-chip stock index falling about 101? by late morning. Tokyo's Nikkei 225-stock index was down about 1.3% at midday.)
The sell-off wasn't confined to the bluechip stocks in the Dow. Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index plunged 28.36 points to 927.69, a decline of nearly 311. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 52.32 points, or 3.47,. Douglas Myers, vice president of stock trading at Interstate/Johnson Lane, said that only five of the 100 largest nonfinan-cial stocks in the Nasdaq index managed a gain, while 15 of the S&P 500 stocks rose.
As if worries about corporate profitability and the ongoing turmoil in Southeast Asia weren't enough, AMG Data Serivces, a mutual-fund data-tracking company in Arcata, Calif., said Friday that flows into stock funds appear to have reached only S917 million in the week ended Jan. 7. That is down from S8.91 billion a year ago, and a 501, decline from week-earlier levels.
“If the market is depending on the kinds of inflows seen in the last two Januarys to support it at its current levels, that didn't happen this week,” said Robert Adler of AMG Data.

worries the concern that people have directed some of lhe money that used to go to stock funds early in the year to bonds instead," said Jon Olesky, head of listed stock trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Indeed, on Friday the Treasury market shrugged off reports that employment levels grew at a much stronger pace than expected in December. As stocks slid
steadily throughout the afternoon, jittery investors dashed for the haven of the bond market, driving the 30-year bellwether bond up about 'a point, or S5 for every St,000 bond. The yield, which moves opposite to the price, dropped to 5.727c.
“The whole consensus has shifted very radically in the last week or two," said Kevin Bannon, chief investment officer at the Bank of New York. "Everyone is worried about Asia putting pressure on earnings and leading to deflation.”
Friday's sell-off leaves the Dow 8.27r below its all-time high, recorded last August. But it still remains 5.97, above the low of 7161.15 set Oct. 27, 1997, after the blue-chip index plunged 554.26 points, its largest point-sized decline in a single day. The ability of the Dow and other market indexes to quickly erase that dramatic loss and. in the case of the S&P .500, to move on to set new records, comforted bulls as recently as last month.
But some analysts argue that even before Friday's plunge, the picture was much darker than the bulls admitted. Even as the indexes rallied, the list of stocks that traded below their Oct. 27 levels lengthened. According to Salomon Smith Barney Inc., more than half of the stocks in the S&P 500 are now 107, or more from their 52-week highs, while nearly 27% of the S&P stocks have tumbled 207, or more.
“The way the indexes like the S&P are calculated and weighted, the nature of the stocks that compose indexes like the Dow, mask what's going on in the broader market," said Jeffery Warantz, senior analyst in the equity research department at Salomon Smith Barney, arguing that Please Turn to Page C2, Column 3

Industrials Plunge 222.2 Points Amid Continued Turmoil in Asia
ABREAST OF THE MARKET
Continued From Page Cl some form of "stealth bear market" was " already shaping up. “The market as a whole looks like an upside down pyramid, standing on its point. It might look real pretty but all it takes is a butterfly flapping its wings nearby to tip it over."
Ned Davis Research Inc. calculates that nearly 25% of the S&P 500 stocks now trade for less than they did on Oct. 27, including onetime market stalwarts like Chase Manhattan and Warner-Lambert; Schlumberger, a highflying oil-services company; and technology stocks such as Oracle and Texas Instruments.
“The market was very narrowly led when it advanced," said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. “If the market can't pull itself up by the bootstraps and broaden, I'll begin to think we'll have a 20% correction sooner this year than I’d originally thought."
Mr. McCabe is one of a number of market participants who believe the market's health is linked to its "breadth," or the number of stocks that rise when indexes do. The narrower the rallies, the weaker they are, these pundits argue. Another red flag are broad-based sell-offs, like those seen Friday.
Mr. Warantz acknowledges that narrowly led markets can still rally, sometimes for years. But a lack of breadth, coming on top of earnings worries which Friday led his firm to trim its suggested allocation to stocks to 50% from 55%, sends the risk of investing in stocks soaring. Moreover, he notes that in 1972, 1987 and again in 1990. bear markets followed on the heels of narrowly led rallies such as last fall's recovery, during which 50% or more of S&P 500 stocks had fallen at least 107, from their 52-week highs. In each case, an external shock (a deteriorating economy, higher interest rates and the Gtdf War) sparked the sett-off. Now, he said he is wondering whether Asia will prove to be the latest such catalyst.
The problem is particularly acute for money managers, who face not only a rapidly growing list of market risks, but the challenge of picking old the steadily diminishing number of stocks that will outperform.
Jerome Caslellini, who heads a Chicago-based team of portfolio managers for Loomis & Sayles, said he anticipates three or four more weeks of turmoil, followed by a “big breakdown" in stock, prices as investors, unnerved by another setback, decide to take some of their winnings of the past three years off the table. Eventually, he and others believe that new market leaders will emerge to trigger a rally with broader support.
Friday’s Market Activity
Blue-chip stocks led the way lower in a sell-off that sent major market indexes to their lowest levels in months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 222.2(1 to 7580.42. wiping out nearly two months of progress, to a low not seen since Nov. 11. The Dow ended the week with a decline of 381.62 points or -1.82%. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 17.35 or 1.95% during the week, ending Friday at 1503.22 after its second-worst point-sized decline ever, a 52.32-poinl drop.
Technology slocks staggered under dedining earnings expectations, a problem pointed out by the losses in Adaptec. The computer-products maker late Thursday urged analysts to modify their earnings expectations for its fiscal third quarter. Shares plunged IT’« to 21 9/16.
Owens-Curning also warned of disappointing earnings. The building-products maker lowered its fiscal 1997 estimate, and said it was taking a S250 million restructuring charge. The stock fell 1% to 32.
Securities brokers saw their stock prices slide as well. Shares of Charles Schwab dropped 2% to 36, while PaineWeh-ber fell I 15/16 to 30".,. and Merrill Lynch lost I 5/16 to 63%. Bear Stearns declined 2 3/16 to 11%.
Seagate Technology dropped 1 1/16 to IS 3/16. The disk-drive maker was a casualty of a disappointing earnings forecast earlier this week.
Some stocks were directly hurt by the signs of more trouble emerging in nations like Indonesia. Shares of CalEnergy dropped 3 3/16 to'23' ,, sinking to a 52-week low. The Omaha, Neb., independent power producer has projects pending in Indonesia.
Other stocks were pressured because their business cycles might be damaged by a weakened global economy. International Paper dropped 2 1/16 to 12 11/16, while Georgia-Pacific, another paper maker, tumbled 2'i to 52 15/16.
Aluminum Co. of America fell 1% to 66' i. The price neared the stock's 52-week low of 65%, set back in April. On Thursday, the company posted weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
The market's slide erased much of AT&T's advance Thursday. The stock lost 1 13/16 to 60 13/16 Friday, and, with 13 million shares changing hands, topped the most-active list on the Big Board.
Salomon Smith Harney also started coverage of RCN (Nasdaq). Shares of the Princeton, N.J., telecom concern advanced 3', to 36 5/16.
