The liquidation after the start was smaller than in recent sessions and when bids for comparatively large blocks of pivotal shares made their appearance part of the supply overhanging the market at somewhat higher levels was withdrawn).

Around mid-day the market was helped by the announcement of President Hoover regarding the conference called for discussing plans to aid in. solving, some of the problems confronting business and industry. In the afternoon the advance was extended as a moderate amount of short covering developed. The advance was general, extending to all groups, with spectacular gains in many directions.

This was due to the fact that preliminary figures indicated September profits had established a record for that month, which would mean that the results for the third quarter would at least be as good as those for the corresponding 1930 period.
