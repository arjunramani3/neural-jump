Abreast of the Market
By Victor J. Hillery
The stock market turned up sharply on a broad front yesterday; the Dow Jones industrial average scored its best gain in three weeks on a slight pick up in trading activity.
Spurting 12.73 points to 682.09, the industrial average recovered more than half the 19.78 points it lost in the previous two sessions.. And gainers on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded declines for the first time in 12 sessions; there were 936 issues up and 354 down.
Most impressive was the 2.81-point climb in the utility average to 100.20. Its rise of 2.88% compared with the industrial average's rise of 1.90%.
Brokers ascribed yesterday’s surprising strength largely to a spreading belief that interest rates may have peaked. They asserted that this belief has been reflected in the recent improvement in the bond market and in the rise in the utility sector of the stock market.
Newton D. Zinder, vice president of E. F. Hutton suggested that the bond market strength “has been impressive enough to make believers out of many heretofore nonbelievers that a peak in interest rates has at long last been seen.” He added that “it was always widely felt that the bond market would have to bottom out before one could look for the stock market to do the same.”
Discount Rate Rumor
Late in the session, a recent rumor resurfaced that the Federal Reserve Board planned a reduction in the discount rate it charges on loans to its member banks; the rate currently is 6%. But no such reduction was made by the board up to late yesterday.
Thrust behind the rise of some of the glamor stocks also was provided by some short covering, or the buying of stock to replace borrowed shares sold earlier.
And the railroad sector, as well as the rest of the market, was helped by President Nixon’s action ordering the walkout by the United Transportation Union against three railroads halted for 60 days and appointing an “emergency board” to investigate the dispute. The Dow Jones transportation average gained 2.37 pointe to 119.06.
The industrial average’s rise yesterday was the sharpest since it surged 18.90 points on June 16.
The bullish factors yesterday combined to outweigh the recent drags on the market, including concern about the corporate earnings picture and the tense situation in the Middle East.
Big Board volume rose to 10,970.000 shares from 10,470,000 on Tuesday. There were 67 trades of 10,000 shares or more, up from 60 on Tuesday as institutional activity accelerated.
In the bond market, prime-quality corporates continued to gain, finishing up % point while long-term U.S. Government issues pulled back % point in the over-the-counter market.
Advances also led the backsliders on the American Stock Exchange and its index moved up 0.13 to 19.76. Turnover slowed a bit to 2,380,000 shares from 2,460,000 the previous session.
Some 158 stocks fell to new lows for the year down from 267 on Tuesday; two issues reached new highs while none did the previous day.
Computer Issues Rebound
Computers, particularly weak recently, were among the strongest stocks yesterday. They were joined by defense, housing, retail, electronic, color television, auto, oil, rubber, publishing, tobacco and savings-and-loan stocks. Some of the airline, chemical, copper, drug, movie, and steel stocks also were higher. Heading down were some of the machinery and gold stocks.
In the glamor group, International Business Machines jumped 10 to 252%. Control Data climbed 3% to 34, Burroughs, 7% to 89%, and National Cash Register 3% to 39%. Sperry Rand advanced 2 to 26% and Honeywell, 2% to 68%.
Among the active glamors, Xerox rose 3% to 74% as the third most active issue on volume of 131,600 shares, of which 46,500 shares
