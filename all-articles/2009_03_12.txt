Rekindled hope that banks will weather the financial crisis propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average back through 7000 for the first time this month.
The Dow surged 239.66 points, or 3.5%, to 7170.06 on Thursday. The benchmark has gained 623.01 points, or 9.5%, since Monday, the biggest three-day winning streak since November.
The broad S&P 500-stock index closed at 750.74, up 4.1% on the day and 11% in the past three days. The gains this week have brought welcome relief for traders and investors who have watched stocks lose half their value over the past 17 months.
Investors cheered the rally, but balked at predicting how much longer it might last.
"I would never go and say this is the bottom, but at least, on a short-term basis, you had an abundance of pessimism that got to a breaking point," said Larry Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston, with about $500 million under management. "We move from despair to euphoria very quickly."
Financial stocks have been the recipient of much of that new enthusiasm. The financial sector of the S&P 500 is up 32% since March 6 as the heads of the nation's largest banks moved to quash fears that their companies may need more government support.
Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis fueled the gains Thursday after telling investors his company was profitable for the first two months of 2009, echoing similar comments from the heads of Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase. Bank of America rose 19%. Citigroup gained 8.4% and J.P. Morgan added 14%.
"It's hard to argue against the banks at this point, when their cost of capital is basically zero," because the government is guaranteeing their new debt, said Stephen Coleman, chief investment officer at the portfolio-managed firm Daedalus Capital, in St. Louis. "They're basically making money every day."
General Motors, another recipient of government money, rose 17% after saying it didn't yet need $2 billion in emergency loans. General Electric gained 13% after a creditrating downgrade was smaller than some investors had feared.
The stock rally has spurred Paul Quinn, president of Focalpoint Capital Management in Bozeman, Mont., to consider buying. Typically, Mr. Quinn holds a portfolio of 20 companies, but he has had five stocks and cash for about six months.
"It's tough to say where it goes from here, but the fact that we had an up day Tuesday and didn't give those gains back shows that we have a rally with some confirmation," he said. "I'm pretty encouraged by it."
Better-than-expected retail sales figures also helped. Consumers, after cutting back deeply in the fourth quarter, may have begun restocking depleted pantries and closets, according to AllianceBernstein economist Joseph Carson. Particularly encouraging, he said, was that the rebound came before the benefit of tax cuts and other stimulus measures.
Still, most economists believe the economy is still shrinking. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month forecast that gross domestic product would decline at an annual rate of 4.6% this quarter and 1.5% in the second quarter. Earlier this week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said that even if financial markets stabilize, he doesn't expect the recession to end until later this year.
Many investors said they still expect more stock declines.
"This is probably a bear-market rally, but we'll accept it for what it is," said Steven Roge, portfolio manager at R. W. Roge & Co., with $160 million under management. Mr. Roge expects the S&P will eventually fall to about 600.
