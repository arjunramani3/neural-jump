Abreast of the Market
Led by Rise in GM. Industrial Average Spurts
7.99 Points for Its Sharpest Climb Since 1939
Taking their cue . om the spectacular rise of General Motors on overnight news of a proposed three-for-one stock split, industrial shares spurted once again on the New York Stock Exchange ■yesterday. The Dow-Jones average of 30 leaders in this division rose 7.99 points. This was the sharpest gain for a single session since September 5. 1939, when stocks shot up more than 10 points on
news of the outbreak of World War II. Kailroad shares, on the other hand, declined and utilities edged up only a trifle for the fifth straight session. Volume on this mixed behavior was largest since June 8, when 3,300,000 shares changed hands in a similarly mixed market.
General Motors, in which no trading took place until 11*17 because of the crush of overnight buying orders, sold initially at 128. up It retained all but a small fraction ol this advance to the close Thus, alone it accounted for 2 60 points ot the industrial average gain
Another large portion was accounted foi bv the combined n*e of 17 points in the thice oil issues in the industtial index—Standard Oil of N J . up 8Ji on Street rumors that it would he the next major issue to be split. Standard Oil of Cahlorma. up 0. and Texas Co . up 3% Railroad^ lagged conspicuously Such lead cis as Kansas City Southern. Atlantic Coast) Line. Rock Island. Southern P.iciiic. Southern . Railway and Delaware & Hudson were particu- ' larly weak, and the carrier average fell more ' than a full point.
Aircrafts also again resisted the advance ' and American Viscose was prominent among a handful of specialties under pressure
International Business Machines, on the other hand, was strong, up as much as S points at the close, as were Aluminium Ltd Minnesota Mining and Roval Dub h in oa:l\ deal mgs

This indicates a net for the full year of nentlv $s a shatc, but Wall Street analysts who lollow the firm’s operations closely are guessing that net may well come closer lo $9 a shaie This would coni-paie with $7.33 a share earned in 1931. of which $5.30 a shaie came fiom operations and $2.03 a share from General Motors dividends Last year Motors paid a total ot $5 a shaie in dividends, including A $2 vcai-end disli ibution Current dividends ate $i quarterly, but the Street is looking for laigcr dividends from Molds than were paid last ye.u ; particula t ly in light of the propound thrre-for-nnr otnrk split If the distribution is mote generous, Du Pont might well show the $9 a shaie that some ate looking for	,

’ t Market Views—
OPINION "The hot that a ptotiacted steel strike was avoided, that laihoad earnings in 1933 hold great piomise and ptusent tvnipuiaiy Height intes probably will be extended ail favoi a resumption of miriest in railroad shates,' accoiding to Waldo M. Allen, of Mitchell, Hutchins A* Co's Chicago office . . Said Kenneth Watd, of Hayden, Stone A Co • ”We are still in a powerful iotating bull market as tlic value of the dollar glows less The demand lor goods of all kinds, and dividend paying equities, will continue regatdless of any overdue correction in the averages fiom this level ’ .	. vThe failute ot the utility average
lo move ahead with the industrials is par licularly disturbing,' accoiding to Edmund W Tiibell. of Walston A* Co , who says that "in the p<isl. the utility average has usually topped out sevcial months before the general mar kct." . . William K. White, of Hornbldwcr & Weeks, believes that "alter the sustained rise of the last six or seven weeks, a short period ot hesitation would be a logical expectation. A more thorough i eadjustment could develop later this month or in August if forthcoming bullish earnings statements should spark an other brisk rise ’	. G S Colby, of DfiPont,
Hornsey A- C’o , o! Boston “Based on the orderly pace or titiding activity attending the most recent rise, there appears no major negative influence to permanently alter the trend ’’	.
Said Walter Maynard, of Shearson. Hammtll A Co “Under present conditions, hopes are high, tears diminished, marginal companies flourish and ultimately the background for severe market errors is created. Fortunately, the'gencial level of market prices ut present
does not seem to be excessive *
