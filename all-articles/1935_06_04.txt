bond market in the past two days has been acting better than the industrial section. Followers of the Dow theory’ may’ yet have their wish fulfilled that the rails will come forward The rails must attain the 32 60 level, which would be a'full point above the April rally tops, to confirm the higher indication given by industrials.
A stronger manifestation of faith in current price levels was indicated in leading commodity and stock markets yesterday when utility stocks were lifted to new 1935 highs, and the 30 industrial issues used in the Dow-Jones averages recovered more than two points, while cotton surged ahead S2 a bale and sugar added 9 to 11 points to the 11 to 16 point gains of the preceding dav. Grain markets were irregular.
The demand for stocks started canttous|\ but no effective resistance was encountered during the day and volume expanded moderately to 870.000 shares from the Monday total of GOO.000 shares. Motor and motor accessory issues wore early favorities, with Chrysler still setting the pace Later the move broadened to embrace other industrials, but it was the utility section around nnd-day that displayed the most vigorous leadership United Corp, preferred was bought m large blocks, and established a new high for the move. Concurrently, accounts of attacks on the holding company legislation in the Senate appeared on the news tickers
Leading railroad shares moved ahestl quietly and showed net gains of 45-100 ol a point in the averages at the end of the day. Union Pacific advanced two points and Great Northern was an active feature on the upside. In the last hour, a wider range of industrials moved higher and the sharpest gains were scored in the late trading. Standard Oil ot New Jersey. Union Carbide, American Can, Chrysler, Phillip Morris and numcious others adding two points or more to their price levels for the day.
The bond market was Irregular, with n slightly firmer tone developing on the late rally In stocks. Foreign exchange markets were quiet until after the close when the franc plunged on new? that the French government had been defeated in its requoct tor broad financial powers by two votes in the Chamber of Deputies.

On the other hand, taking the Federal Reserve weekly figures of loans by member bank:, in Nev York City tor the period from May 2 to 29. inclusive, a $1,000,000 decline is indicated These figures are not strictly tomparable with the «tock exchange totals, there being a flight difference in the borrowers as well as in the number of days, but only a mild change is indicated whichever figures are accepted Morcnvci, figures on the loan ratio issued h.v the Nev.

UNDERLYING STRENGTH—
The underlying demand for stocks is still large. Those who have placed orders under the market, either actually or at mental buying points, arc repeatedly disappointed, for selling dries up and prices strengthen before the setback attains the proportions which many have visioned for the market.
One big commission house which has been bearish on the general list through the May rise is now recommending that the electrical equipments, housing, railroad equipments and a few specialties in the industrial supply field be accumulated on market reactions during the next month. This house has been waiting for some indication ot the probable fate of the NRA for the past month and has assumed right along that there would be ample opportunity’ to buy stocks during June, when the business indices, according to these expectations, would slump close to their low levels.
