The Fed unveiled a broadened securities-lending program for banks and bond dealers, offering to lend them as much as $200 billion of much-sought Treasurys from its own portfolio for as many as 28 days in return for a variety of collateral, including bonds backed by mortgages that aren't guaranteed by government-sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Stocks chalked up their biggest one-day gain in five years after the Federal Reserve applied a new dose of emergency medicine to heal convulsing credit markets.
The Fed unveiled a broadened securities-lending program for banks and bond dealers, offering to lend them as much as $200 billion of much-sought Treasurys from its own portfolio for as many as 28 days in return for a variety of collateral, including bonds backed by mortgages that aren't guaranteed by government-sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rocketed 416.66 points, or 3.6%, to 12156.81, its gains accelerating toward the end of the session. Twenty-nine of its 30 components posted gains, including jumps of more than 9% in Citigroup and American Express. (Boeing was the one decliner.)
As investors ventured again into stocks and riskier assets, Treasury bonds fell and their yields rose sharply.
The stock rally snapped a three day-losing streak for the Dow and was the biggest percentage-gain increase for the average since March 2003.
Financial stocks, which had been beaten down over the past few weeks, led gains in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which jumped 3.7%, or 47.28 points, to 1320.65. The tech-stock-focused Nasdaq Composite Index was up 4%, or 86.42 points, at 2255.76.
Still, if recent history is any guide, the positive market reaction could be short-lived. Since August, the U.S. government has provided nearly $1 trillion in direct and indirect support to financial institutions in a bid to help unfreeze the credit markets. That includes lending from the Fed and Federal Home Loan banks, and efforts to free up lending by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, the credit crisis has only gotten worse, and the stock market has gone through several false starts.
"With every action the Fed tries, the euphoric effect on the market seems to be shorter and shorter," said James Kauffmann, head of fixed income at ING Investment Management in Atlanta.
Stocks often experience sharp one-day rallies at the end of bear markets. But they can enjoy brief rallies during bear markets, too, during bouts when investors unwind bets against the market, known as short positions.
In a sign that investors continue to see considerable stress in the financial system, they are still paying hefty sums for insurance against bond defaults by banks and brokerages in the market for credit-default swaps. An index that tracks the cost of credit protection on 50 investment-grade companies, including many financial institutions, rose slightly yesterday, according to Credit Derivatives Research.
The annual cost of insuring $10 million of Bear Stearns Cos. debt, which had soared Monday, rose to $640,000 yesterday before dropping to $590,000 at the end of the day, according to data from Phoenix Partners Group.
With the Fed's latest effort, investment dealers can now in effect finance a wider variety of their own securities holdings at the Fed than previously. The Fed hopes this will make banks, dealers and investors more comfortable about buying and holding such assets.
"The market needs and wants liquidity and these facilities clearly address it," said Bill Hornbarger, a strategist at A.G. Edwards. "It helps to buy time and removes some pressure from the financial institutions, but this alone isn't going to solve the problems."
Analysts said the Fed's move did help some important corners of the debt markets. Agency mortgage bonds, or securities backed by home loans that are guaranteed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, rose and their yields fell.
These securities, which were traditionally viewed as among the safest investments in the credit markets, have fallen sharply in the past few weeks because banks, brokerages and hedge funds have been selling them to reduce leverage.
Yesterday, the difference between interest rates on agency bonds backed by 30-year Fannie Mae mortgages and yields on five-year Treasury bonds narrowed slightly to 3.22 percentage points from 3.36 percentage points a day earlier, according to Bear Stearns. Last week that spread soared to a record high of more than 3.5 percentage points.
There were also improvements in corners of the money markets. The two-year swap spread, which reflects the difference between the yield on government securities and
the London Interbank Offered Rate, has narrowed from a recent record high of 1.05 percentage points to 0.95 percentage point.

The Fed's move lifted the dollar, which rose to 103.41 from 101.73 yen a day ago. The euro was at $1.5316 from $1.5352. The 10-year Treasury note fell 1 10/32 points, or $13.125 for every $1,000 invested. Its yield rose to 3.596% from 3.438% Monday.
