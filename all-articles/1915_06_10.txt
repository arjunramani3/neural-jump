ACTIVE AND STRONG
Street was more hopeful of a solution of the German difficulty and advancing movement was general.	*
‘	*	Sales 478.338 shares
, The Street waA impressed with the forecasts of the note to Germany, and there was a disposition to indulge in’ favorable anticipations of the outcome. This cheerful frame of mind was reflected in an advancing tendency of ■prices, which began at the opening and continued almost without interruption to the end of the day. The activity however, was not great, and an undue proportion of it was concentrated in a comparatively few stocks, while some of the standard issues contributed .very little to the day’s business. In Atchison, only 1,000 shares were done, winie stocks like St. Paul, Northern Pacific, New York Central, New Haven, Baltimore & Ohio, Brooklyn Rapid Transit and Interborough-Metropolitan preferred fell under the 1,000 share mark. The concentration of trading in a few issues indicated that the dealings were of a professional character, and for that reason the large advances which occurred in some issues were deprived of the significance which in a broad market might have been attached to% them. On the other hand, the fact that gains were made all through the list indicated that the floating supply of stock was small, and that the technical position had been strengthened as a result of bearish operations in* the .past wek. The metal issues were among the strongest features throughout the day; General Electric was the most prominent in the war group; and American Can surpassed every other stock in respect to activity, advancing several points in the afternoon on rumors that the antitrust suit had been settled out of the court. United States Steel showed better action than on any other day since the district court rendered the decision in its favor, its strength being explained by the improvement in trade conditions reflected by steadily increasing activity at the mills.
The wheat market, after an advance due to covering of shorts, yielded to the favorable crop conditions; and "Wall Street appeared to be giving increased attention to the highly promising agricultural prospects. The continued advance in the price of metals used in the manufacture of war munitions, like copper lead and spelter, attracted much attention; and the buying of industrial stocks indicated confidence in the prospect of improved industrial conditions. The money market was somewhat easier on time, but call rates were unchanged; and in foreign exchange an easier tendency developed late in the day. particularly in francs and marks. The weekly statement of the Bank of England was better than that of a week .ago, bullion holdings being increased, and the proportion of reserve to liabilities raised to 20.80Cr> from 20.20^r. The Bank of France showed a further increase of circulation without a corresponding addition to the gold holdings; and the Bank of Germany reported a further mysterious addition to its stocks of gold, although the amount .added, $630,000, was much smaller than the weekly average of a few months ago.
Transactions totaled 47S.000 shares, and in the most active stocks advances amounted to two points or over.
Over-Nijclii Gain* '
At the opening the market was quiet, hut prices were higher all around, the Street feeling confident that Mr. Bryan had effaced himself, and that his efforts to embarrass this country and advance the German cause would be entirely unavailing.
Steel made an overnight gain of % by opening at 57%. General Electric gained 1% on the first sale, and increased its gain to 3 points by selling up to 167% at the end of a few minutes. Bethlehem Steel, after opening at 162, rose to 165 on the next few sales, compared with 162% at Wednesday’s close. In Westinghouse the first transaction was nt 93%. a gain of %. and the stock almost immediately rose to 95 %.
In Union Pacific the first sale was 1%, up at 126947 while Canadian Pacific started at an advance of %. The favorable crop conditions seemed to be producing some effect. Reading gained % overnight and the coppers were among the strong features. Amalgamated opening % up at 72%. while American Smelting & Refining made an initial gain of %, to which it immediately added an additional fraction.
TUse in Motor Issues	*
Shortly after the'opening the market quieted down, but stocks held their advance, and. at the end of the first half hour the list in general displayed a good tone. The good feeling was partly a result of the belief 'that the note to Germany, while very firm, was friendly, and would leave the Kaiser’s government in a position to retire gracefully from its present attitude.	e	_
Willys-Overland was a very strong feature, advancing to 129 compared with 126% at the close on Wednesday, and a high of 128 for that day. Studebaker was another prominent • feature of the motor group, advancing 2% to 73%. These two companies are now making cars at a very popular price, combining a certain amount of beauty and comfort with serviceability.
In the war group General Electric made the largest advance, rising to 168 compared with 164% at the close on Wednesday; while Crucible Steel was active and gained 1% by selling at 31%. JThe equipment stocks, in which * there was much activity a week or two ago. .contributed comparatively little to the first half hour’s business.
Strength of Smelters
After a short period of hesitation, in which a good tone was preserved, the market again resumed its upward movement; and at eleven o’clock the trading was active, with prices considerably above the opening level.
In German circles it was admitted that a protest by Mr. Bryan was not considered necessary to "insUre that the tone of Mr. Wilson’s note would be friendly; and that the probable result of Bryan’s opposition would be to solidify the support of the President’s policy.
American Smelting & Refining was a particularly strong feature, responding to the further advance in the price of lead, sales of that metal being said to have been made at 7 cents, compared with 5% cents ’two days ago.
Certain prominent operators who generally swing very large amounts of stock were said to have accumulated big lines of Steel in the past few days. It was predicted that the statement for the quarter ending June 30 would show net earnings of at least $25,000,000, or the equivalent of about 1% for the common stock after payment of the 1% cn the preferred.
Pacific Mail, on which bull tips have been ’circulated for some time, crossed 29 compared	- --
cn Wednesday.
General Electric’s Rise
Although the trading was not ket showed pronounced strength to hour, and some of the most careful
with 26% at the close
very active, the mar-the end of the second «»4.v«	v. ...- ..._-______observers on the floor
said there was evidence of important accumulation in tho leading stocks. It was argued that Germany might yield to demands made in a very friendly way even on points which it could not be forced to concede through fear or intimidation.	.	. ~
In connection with the plan to liquidate the Pacific Mail Co. it was said there are five steamers of large size which could be disposed of at an average of a.bout-$2.000,-600 each, and fourteen small vessels, besides valuable dock and warehouse properties; and that the aggregate amount realized would probably be sufficient for a distribution of between $50 and $60 a share on the $20,000,000 stock. There are no bonds, and the amount of notes and other obligations is onlv about $3,000,000.	_	,
General Electric moved up 6% points to l<0%. and it was said that the orders for about $100,000,000 of war supplies would not be allowed to clog up the company s electrical .capacity, as a large part of them would be distributed to other concerns. Reports of further war orders caused an advance of 2% in Can to 42%.

stocks in general were, verj firm, and in the list pronounced strength was shown, ticularly the case in the rncta! issues. ’ - .
to the active demand for copper, lead and spelter at advancing prices.
The increase of 102,000 tons in the Steel Corporation's unfilled tonnage, by comparison with a month ago. x.-as considered favorable in view of the largely increased activity at the mills; and the Street took great interest in the statement by Dow, Jones & Co. that the incoming business is now above 40.00C tons a day. compared with an average of 37,500 tons last month, and between 30.000 and 33,000 tons a day in the first three months of the year. Following the publication of these figures, the stock advanced to 59. compared with 57 at the close on Wednesday.
As a result of the rapid rise in lead prices. National I .cad advanced to <37. Smelters 2% to 77%, and Federal Mining & Smelting 5S to 29%.
•Commission houses reported that their customers were net inclined to add to their commitments, pending .publication of the note to Berlin, notwithstanding the forecasts of a “friendly" document.
Atlvimve in C»n
There was an increase of strength in the late afternoon, but it was not accompanied by any marked improvement in respect to activity. There was still an inclination to await publication of the note to Berlin, but apparently the supply of stocks was small. The Washington dispatch to Dow, Jones & Co., stating that the note would leave a way open to the German government by which the submarine difficulty could be settled without sacrifice of principle, attracted much attention.
Buying of Can by Clark, Childs & Co., amounting to 25,000 shares or more in tho course of the session was regarded as well informed.
There was a good demand for Amalgamated and Anaconda, partly based on belief that the latter would increase its diyidend at the meeting of directors this month.
