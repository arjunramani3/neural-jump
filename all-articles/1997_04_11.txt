All gone!
The last of the stock market's 1997 gains vanished Friday in a thinly traded but bloody sell-off that left only a handful of stocks unscathed by the end of the day.
Shattering convictions by some analysts that the slide in stock prices had been halted a week earlier, the 148.36-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average took the blue-chip index to 6391.69, its lowest level since Dec. 18, 1996, and 9.8% below its high of 7085.16. With Wall Street market makers laden with unwanted stocks purchased Friday from clients who wanted to get out of positions, the fear is that today will be the day the slide becomes a correction, with prices dropping more than 10% from the highs set earlier this year. And investors are left wondering where they can hide.
"What a day," sighed Michael Clark as Friday's trading drew to a close. The head of block trading at Credit Suisse First Boston said the fact that volume was thin didn't make much difference. "This kind of decline is like being hit by an 18-wheeler -- you end up dead no matter what."
The catalyst for the latest plunge (the industrial average's eighth-largest daily point decline, but insignificant in percentage terms) was the release of data Friday morning showing unexpected signs of strength in the economy. A surge in producer prices intensified fears that Federal Reserve policymakers will continue to raise interest rates to ward off inflation, and that a series of interest-rate increases will eventually take their toll on corporate earnings and stock prices. Moreover, as the economic data rattled the bond market, the yield on the 30-year bellwether Treasury bond surged to 7.16%, the highest level since July. Then, market strategists point out, the industrial average was nearly 1000 points below its current level.
"I'm hearing more and more people talking about relative valuations favoring bonds rather than stocks in this climate," says Mr. Clark. "If the bond yield hits 7.5%, how many more people are going to decide there isn't 7.5% of upside in this kind of rocky market?"

There seems little chance the gloom will lift anytime soon. The only positive sign in Friday's trading was the absence of panic in the selling. For every stock that gained ground, nearly seven fell; only two of the Dow Jones industrials' 30 components posted tiny gains for the day and the only Dow Jones industry group to gain ground was the tobacco sector. Technology stocks, whose apparent recovery earlier in the week gave investors comfort, slumped again, driving the Nasdaq Composite Index down 2.3%, or 28.87 points, to 1206.90. The industrial average's latest slide, and the 20.69-point drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to 737.65, brought both market indexes to the verge of the 10% decline that marks a correction. (The Nasdaq index is off 13% from its high.)
Since stronger-than-expected earnings from key companies weren't enough to send the market higher last week, few traders think that good news from that front will halt further declines, let alone spark any kind of a rally. So for many money managers, the crucial question has become how best to survive the sell-off.
"There's a lot of controversy about what a defensive group is in this kind of market," says Marion Schultheis, senior portfolio manager at IDS Advisory Services in Minneapolis. Utilities are in the midst of being deregulated, and have become less of a haven for investors, she says, while it's hard to advocate hanging onto high-yielding energy stocks in the face of falling oil prices.
Food stocks, another traditional haven, are expensive after their big price gains of the past months. Still, that's one of the few places Ms. Schultheis feels comfortable putting money.
Some strategists are advocating a return to the once-popular art of market timing. Timing the market's twists and turns -- selling at the highs and building up big cash positions to put to work at the bottom of dips -- might be a good way to cope with a volatile and unstable stock market, they argue. Cash, which until recently has been viewed as a drag, is starting to look more like a strategic resource that can improve performance in rocky markets.
"Almost no one believes in market timing today, but it's still true that in severe market downturns, people with significant reserves of cash become heroes," says Byron Wien, market strategist at Morgan Stanley. "I've been telling clients they should use the next rally, if it occurs, to raise cash because market timing is about to become respectable again."
Mr. Wien isn't alone in advocating a return to market timing. Don Hays, chief market strategist at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond, Va., who at the beginning of the year recommended a stock allocation of 90%, now urges clients to sock away 30% of their portfolio in cash for the next six to nine months. That period, he says, will be a tough stretch for stocks, as one kind of bull market ends -- the one that favors large blue chips -- and another one, characterized by strong demand for small and medium-sized stocks, struggles to emerge in the midst of rising interest rates.
"We're in a period of transition, and keeping 30% in cash is going to help people get through it," he says. "We're going to see a series of stock-market declines" between now and October, each of which, he believes, will create new buying opportunities for those with cash to put to work.
Indeed, mutual funds with large cash holdings have already shown their ability to withstand market shocks. In the first quarter, says Russel Kinnel, head of equity research at Morningstar Inc., the average diversified U.S. stock fund had a cash position of 5.6% and lost 2.02%. But the 79 funds within that group that held cash positions of 20% or more gained 2.2% in the same period, he says.

The market's precipitous drop over the last few weeks means arguments in favor of market timing are at least commanding an audience. But even Friday's slide wasn't enough to revive enthusiasm for the strategy. That's because as the stock market's rally has only briefly been interrupted in the last two years, investors who have tried to maintain large cash positions or defensive holdings in bonds have underperformed key market indexes by a wide margin. Today, many money managers believe trying to anticipate sell-offs and rebounds is a foolhardy approach and they dismiss the modest gains of cash-rich funds as a short-term phenomenon.
The problem with timing is that "you've got to make not just one, but two decisions right: the decision about when to get out of the market and into cash, and when to jump back into stocks again," says Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Funds in Boston. "Over a period of time, I don't know too many people who can make both of those decisions correctly."
In addition, Mr. Freedman says, a manager would have to accumulate at least 20% of his or her portfolio in cash before it would make a difference to returns. Given the fate of Jeff Vinik, the former manager of Fidelity's flagship Magellan fund, in the wake of his poorly timed but widely publicized shift into bonds, that's a decision few are willing to make.
In fact, the only legitimate reason for an increase in cash reserves, many institutional investors say, is a temporary dearth of attractive stocks in which to invest new money flowing into their coffers. That, they say, is what accounts for any increase in cash positions at many funds, and not an urge to be defensive or build up a war chest in anticipation of a downturn creating buying opportunities.
Mr. Freedman says he's seen some John Hancock fund managers "drag their feet investing new cash for a few days" in hopes that a downturn would allow them to buy stocks more cheaply. But he notes John Hancock chose to close its Freedom Regional Bank Fund to new investors because cash had flooded in so rapidly managers couldn't invest it fast enough, and cash holdings reached 20%.
Stephen Canter, chief investment officer of Dreyfus, says an acceptable cash level for fund managers now is between 3% and 5%, rising to 7% to 8% if it's difficult to find stocks to buy. "But at some level around 10%, we say that's enough; you've simply got to choose something now," he says.
But Morgan Stanley's Mr. Wien isn't urging investors to begin unloading stocks right now in favor of cash.
"This market is still vulnerable on the downside," he says. "It's going to be a distressed environment to sell into until we get very, very oversold or we get some relief on the interest-rate front."
That's likely to leave many institutional investors just where they've been for much of the last week: firmly on the sidelines.
"People have enough new cash in hand, they don't need to be aggressive sellers," says Jon Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley. "But they're not in a mood to be stupid, either. They'd rather see this thing hit a real bottom and turn higher, than just pick an arbitrary point at which to buy. They'll err on the side of caution.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 148.36-point decline Friday, to 6391.69, gave it a 134.38-point, or 2.6%, decline for the week.
Among blue-chip stocks that reacted most strongly to rate-increase fears Friday, J.P. Morgan dropped 4 1/2 to 93 1/2, Citicorp sank 5 1/4 to 104 7/8, Chase Manhattan lost 3 7/8 to 90 1/4, Bank of Boston retreated 3 1/8 to 64 1/8, and BankAmerica gave up 4 1/4 to 101 3/8.
Meanwhile, financial-services stocks were also giving up ground. Beneficial fell 3 to 60 5/8, Marsh & McLennan slipped 2 3/8 to 115 3/4, Travelers Group lost 2 5/8 to 46 3/8, and First USA surrendered 2 1/2 to 43 3/4.
Biogen fell 5 7/8 to 32 7/8 on Nasdaq. Analyst David Stone of Cowen & Co. cut his 1997 sales estimates for the company's Avonex multiple-sclerosis drug to $265 million from $290 million, citing "company guidance." The Cowen estimate had been higher than that of many other analysts.
Boston Scientific plunged 14 3/8 to 46 1/8. The medical-device maker said its first-quarter earnings report will fall short of Wall Street's expectations. Analysts at several firms cut their ratings on the stock.
Among the worst performers on Wall Street in the session was Intel, which tumbled 6 3/4 to 130 1/2 on Nasdaq, as investors got nervous ahead of the release of its first-quarter numbers, scheduled for early this week.
The rest of the chip group suffered in the session, including Advanced Micro Devices, which lost 1 1/2 to 38 1/4, and Applied Materials (NASD), which fell 1 1/2 to 50 1/4.
Vitesse Semiconductor lost 3 5/8 to 29 3/4 on Nasdaq, even though the chip maker on Thursday reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results.
W.W. Grainger dropped 2 3/8 to 73 7/8. The distributor of maintenance supplies reported first-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' forecasts.
Enron fell 1 1/8 to 35 7/8. The energy producer missed analysts' forecasts with its first-quarter earnings.
Electronics for Imaging dropped 3 3/8 to 38 3/8 on Nasdaq, even though the company, which makes electronic printing systems, topped Wall Street's forecast with its first-quarter results.
Tellabs advanced 2 to 39 7/8 on Nasdaq. The telecommunications-equipment maker Thursday reported first-quarter results that beat Wall Street's forecasts. Raymond James boosted its rating on the company's stock.
C-Cube Microsystems added 3/8 to 27 3/8 on Nasdaq. The company, which designs video chips, Thursday reported first-quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates. The stock finished with modest gains, giving up most of an advance of 1 3/4 intraday.
Keane (AMEX) jumped 5 1/2 to 36 1/4, and reached a 52-week high intraday. The software developer beat analysts' forecasts with its first-quarter earnings results. Alex. Brown raised its rating on the stock.
Columbia Gas lost 1 1/4 to 56 5/8, despite stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings.
