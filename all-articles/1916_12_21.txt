THE
MARKET
PRICES RECKLESSLY SLAUGHTERED
31<urkjet. overcome by voluntary liquidation,. whicii runs into panicky conditions under bear pressure, with -final enforced selling on margin exhaustion—Collapse extends to all departments.
Sales, 3,176,800 shares.
Absolute disregard of values was reflected in the most panicky market of the year* and. one which approached. if it did not exceed* the wild fluctuations of 1907. No such extremes were reached as'in the Northern Pacific panic of 1901. The volume of trading was the second largest on record. The overturn of 3*176*800shares compared with 3*281*226 on April -30, and 3,081,765 on May 9 of 1901.	.
Liquidation assumed three phntrep Scared holders sold out on the strength of the President's peace proposals. supplemented by Secretary Lansing^s remarkable explanation of their purpose. Bears took advantage of the situation to pound prices further; anil, finally, exhausted margins brought about involuntary liquidation, which helped to keep up the speed of the avalanche of offerings. I’rice sacrifices were extreme. U. S. Steel was driven below 101. This compares with sales as recently as Tuesday at 116.^ Equipment and industrial issues generally showed comparatively similar losses, while the coppers. among the leading issues* recorded losses running to 25 points from recent high levels. The rails were taken in the maelstrom, with extreme declines* both actual and as compared with their usual conservative behavior, if being a necessary corollary of the violent liquidation in the industrials that other holdings should be sacrificed to protect market positions.
Steel prices continue their upward march and the average is now at $74.14 per gross ton. Railroad earnings on twenty roads for the first week in December increased 17.60'7' over last year, when the increase was 16%- over 1914.
Financial London is cheerful on assurance by Premier George that there will not be an unsatisfactory and premature peace; and Professor Stowell, of the chair of International I^aw at Columbia University* predicts a continuation of the war but says that the end is now in sight. The British sentiment still is, ‘’No faltering until victory comes.”
The British Government is* extending the list of securities tn be loaned to it to avoid special tax. Canada is continuing refinancing of municipal securities in this market. There is a continuance of gold imports on British account and an increasing rate of gold exports to South America.
Tho interpretation the Exchanges put on all these factors i> bearish, * thinking them only preliminary to changed '-onditions in tKTs country*
Opens with sellingr pressure
Price*- went down with a smash at the opening on excited selling following the President’s peace overtures, in the following ten minutes trading there were further losses m a wild market. There were 50,000 share*. of Steel at the opening quoted from 104% to 105 % as compared with a close of 108. Crucible lost 8 points to 53. Lackawanna sold off over 3 points, and equipment issues made recessions of 1 to 2 points.
Fair recoveries
Before the close of the first half hour the decline was at least temporarily checked and fair recoveries were in progress, carrying prices of some issues above the closing level. One of these was Baldwin which sold to 65, up
Tn tho rails there was a reversal of form, with Union Pacific gaining 1*5* from its early low, which placed it above the closing level. Expectation is strong that the directors today -will discuss officially an extra dividend independent of any general plan which may come later for distribution of assets. Reading and Eric recovered nearly all their lo«s and othei issues in the group ruled ft rm.
The "President's note
Covering by shorts who found themselves with unexpectedly large profits in hand, and professional manipulation to ^ack-up prices evidently for the purpose of further distribution, kept the market churning during the* second half hour, and offset to a great extent liquidation arising from timid holders and from exhausted margin accounts.
It was generally felt that tjie President’s note must be seriously considered by the belligerent powers, even though it should bring about no immediate action. Com-
ment of the local press was by no means enthusiastic ex-£Bpt on the part of the Staats Zeitung. n>e other papers* fiovever, admitted that it could do no harm and might do some good. It was taken in the market as a final signal for further readjustment of xnarket commitmenta, wiU eventually bring prices into line for a peace h—’p* if they have not already arrived there.
Nervousness	,
The market -was extremely nervous and sensitive throughout the second hoar, and from that fact was naturally irregular. After the heavier early covering by the shorts, the bears ‘resumed aggressive tactics and in the assault U. S. Steel was-put back to 104, subsequently recovering nearly two points from that leveL	~
Selling wave from the West
As distant points began to be. heard from during the early afternoon* the market resembled the election returns late on November 7 last when Hughes majorities in the East began to the undermined' by the wave of Wilson votes from the West. So the West now was later in getting into action, as it got its news of the President's peace proposals later, and then followed the example of the East by placing selling orders in large volume. Also th*>re must bo arriving at Western points now the letters of New York wire houses announcing restrictions on margins amounting in some cases to their entire elimination. Still again 'the suggestion that this country is on the verge of war if the belligerent nations do not respond to the President’s call gave renewed impetus to the selling movement. Prices melted away like the snows of the Pacific Northwest before the Chinook wind.
Ralls alTe<*tecl	-
The reactions were by no means confined to the war stocks* as it was impossible to accomplish the heavy liquidation under way without undermining the situation of the so-called peace stocks as well. While United States Steel was being driven to 102, Reading dropped back to 100, a decline of 7 points from the morning high. Union Pacific, apparently resentful of the size of the extra dividend, fell to 144* off 5% from the day's high. Southern Railway lost nearly 3 points and the other rails without exception took part in the decline.
Extreme declines
Trading was so fast and furious in the last half hour that neither brokers nor customers knew where they stood. The ticker was anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five minutes late, and while U. S. Steel was bring recorded or the tape at 100%, telephonic reports from the floor reported 102 bid. Space and time were still being wasted on the tape by endless repetitions of needless ciphers to describe the large blocks concerned in the overturn. It was useles to attempt to arrive at any conclusion as to the final trend of the market with such needless obstacles interposed. A few of the quotations available showed that Baldwin, after its early strength, had sbld as low as 52%. Marine pfd was quoted at 84%. Intcrnatio.ial Nickel at 39%. and Union Pacific at 142%. Distillers, paying 6^. sold at 25. Studebaker, after its morning advance, dropped hack over 10 point*, to 103. General Electric sold at 16154, and New York Central at 101X4.
