Complete	tabulation of the Doir-Jone*		stock aver-
apea, with cfiarta, second		from laat papa.	
The first day of trading; after the holiday found stocks soft again, especially pivotal industrial and utility issues, and the market sagged further, with a number of stocks setting new lows on the current reaction. Bonds were firm in the morning, but in tbe afternoon they lost their buoyancy and moved irregularly lower. Stocks and bonds were affected by the weakness in the two principal commodity markets. Cotton declined nearly $1.50 a bale; wheat, under pressure, sank to new season's low and closed off slightly more than a cent a bushel.
Trading in stocks was dull all day and the market, from the start, was a sluggish affair. Leaders began the day showing very little change from Tuesday’s final prices. Telephone, Steel and Allied Chemical were off an eighth of a point at the opening and Central was only a shade under Tuesday’s last price. For a time the market held firm, but by noon most of the leaders were off from one to three points. The oils were an exception. Standard of New Jersey holding fractionally above the previous close.
American Telephone was selling at lOO1^ at noon and was conspicuously weak. Steel common and preferred were down, and Allied Chemical was a soft spot. In the early afternoon the declining tendency was accelerated, due partly to the break in wheat and lower cotton. Near the closer short covering induced a mild recovery from the day’s lows, but Telephone closed under par, and off 3S». and Allied Chemical, at 67, was down 4^.
Market Practically Ignores Nenn
The market paid little attention to the day’s news or to developments over the holiday. Both New York Central and Pennsylvania loadings for the week ended October 8 were distinctly better than for the previous week, and the decline from the similar 1931 week was less than for the previous weekly periods.
The drop in the call money renewal rate to 1% had no effect whatever on the markets, being regarded merely as proof of the practically non-existent demand for funds.
Electric output figures for the latest week were slightly ahead of those for the previous week, and the decline from 1931 was exactly the same as that of the week ended October 1.
The Sears, Roebuck sales report for the four weeks to October 8 showed b. large diminution in the percentage decline from the like 1931 weeks from the percentage drop from 1931 recorded in the 40 weeks to October 8. The stock, however, dragged almost a point lower.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics Index of commodity prices for the week ended October 8 was fractionally lower.
The markets abroad showed no clearly defined trend. Bonds in London were higher, but stocks were irregular. In Faris stocks ruled generally lower in a dull market.
The Wheeling Pays Again
Payment of another dividend on the prior lien stock by the Wheeling & Lake Ene Railway at the rate of $7 a share is a boon both to the Reconstruction Finance Corp, and the Nickel Plate. Interest on the loans made by the Reconstruction Finance Corp, to the Nickel Plate is amply covered by the Wheeling dividend payment, so at least the Nickel Plate has no worries from that quarter.
So far, the R. F. C. and the R. R. C. have announced loans totaling $12,600,000 to the Nickel Plate. Another $5,600,000, to aid in the road’s refinancing program, has been approved, but is held in abeyance until the Nickel Plate noteholders make up their minds whether to come in under the plan.
The Nickel Plate’s block of 115,193 of the 118,828 Wheeling & Lake Erie prior lien shares outstanding is pledged with the R. F. C. under the loan the Nickel Plate already has received. A full $7 payment on the Wheeling stock would mean $806,351 in income. Even if the Nickel Plate is paying as much as 6% for its present loan, annual interest would be covered by a margin of more than $50,000.
So far this year, the Wheeling hasn’t quite covered charges and taxes. For the six months ended June 30, it had a loss of $267,329, but net in July and August about halved the loss. The road was amply able to make the dividend payment, for it had current assets of $5,237.173 at the end of July, against current liabilities of $837,418.
The Cotton Cloth Sales Figures
Two months of sustained demand for cotton cloth has accomplished wonders for the cotton textile industry, the September figures show. Since the .end of July, stocks on hand have been cut to 160,121,000 yards from 281,249,000 yards, in spite of the fACt that production has been stepped up from 141,673,000 yards
the Market
in July to 284,956,000 yards in September, or more than 100%.
The only thing about the September figures which did not make unusually favorable contrast with those of August was that unfilled orders, at the end of September, were down 8% from the total at the end of August. Still, unfilled orders of 444,028,000 yards at the end of September constituted a larger backlog than at the similar date in 1929, and stocks on hand then were more than 180,000,000 yards larger than at September 30, last.
,The Money Peg Fulled
The drop in the official call money rate to 1% from 2% is a belated recognition of actual conditions in the money market, and, in fact, not a full recognition of the extraordinary ease that has resulted from the piling up of more than $200,000,000 excess reserves in the New York City banks. For months call money has been available in the “cutside” market at less than the official pegged rate of 2% which had prevailed since July 7.
At the present rate of 1%, call loans, which are about the safest and most liquid short-term investment in the country, are giving a higher return than 90-day time loans, although ordinarily call rates are lower than time rates. Under existing conditions, an even lower call rate would be justified, and such rates would not be unprecedented. In 1908, call money loaned at % of 1%, and in 1904, 1894, 1885 and 1884 it got down to a half.
A Month of the New City Subway
Even the city officials most ardently committed to operation of the new municipal subway line must have had something of a shock when they read that the new Eighth Avenue line took in just $255,940 in the first month of operation. Actual income from operations for the month, after paying operating expenses, charging out depreciation and other items, could not have been more than $60,000 or $70,000. Net operating income for the year certainly will not run to much over $1,000,000, and, even at 4%, the interest on the city’s investment in the lLne runs to around $7,600,000 annually.
The city’s taxpayers, of course, will have to foot the deficit. They will continue to pay the bill until they become sufficiently aroused to do something about it. The new Democratic nominee for mayor has committeed himself to preserving the 5-cent fare, which has been preserved for years at the taxpayers’ expense.
Bennett on Chemicals
No section of Prime Minister Bennett’s statement in regard to the new Canadian tariff, readjusting the barrier to favor trade with the United Kingdom, was more interesting than his remarks about the chemical industry. Tbe schedule has been revised “from end to end,’’ the Canadian prime minister declared, adding: “The immediate diversion will be great; the potential, incalculable. As industry continues to turn more and more to research and laboratory, and as science becomes more and more applied rather than pure and academic, so will the place and power of the chemical factor in our modern development continue to grew apace.” The prime minister made the point that the new duties would permit exploitation and development of Empire sources of chemicals, which would put the Empire forward in its effort to gain self sufficiency.
