"The pace of stock selling has slowed significantly and the number of mutual-fund redemptions has slowed significantly. Those are positive signs," said Matthew Johnson, head of U.S. stock trading at New York brokerage firm Lehman Brothers. "The market is trying to find a bottom." But he added, "I don't think we are by any stretch of the imagination out of the woods."
Word of the Brazil package helped beleaguered U.S. banks such as Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, since it reduced the risk that they would have to deal with more bad Latin American debt.
Outside the U.S., stock prices advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 1.55%, or 1.66 points, to 108.87.

THE DOW JONES Industrial Average staged its biggest three-day percentage gain since 1987, as optimism surrounding such disparate market forces as the U.S. Federal Reserve, Brazil and Citigroup sent the blue chips up more than 255 points.
Trying to pick out the immediate catalysts, traders pointed to the Fed's monetary-policy meeting scheduled for Tuesday, to the International Monetary Fund's $30 billion bailout of Brazil and to Citigroup's announcement of a series of corporate-governance measures aimed, in part, at calming worries that its investment bankers might help companies hide their debts from the public.
That kind of news is contributing to a belief on the part of some money managers that U.S. stocks have hit at least a temporary bottom and will work their way ahead for the immediate future. Late in the day, instead of selling stocks and shifting money to the relative safety of Treasury bonds, money managers once again sold bonds and shifted toward stocks.
"The pace of stock selling has slowed significantly and the number of mutual-fund redemptions has slowed significantly. Those are positive signs," said Matthew Johnson, head of U.S. stock trading at New York brokerage firm Lehman Brothers. "The market is trying to find a bottom." But he added, "I don't think we are by any stretch of the imagination out of the woods."
The Dow industrials jumped 3.03%, or 255.87 points, to 8712.02, up 8% in three days in the first three-day, triple-digit jump in 16 months. The surge this week is the biggest three-day climb since the industrials were up 9% in the autumn of 1987. The index is now almost back to where it was at the end of July, when it finished a previous surge. The blue chips still are down 13% this year and are 26% off their record, set more than two years ago.
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.78%, or 35.62 points, to 1316.52, still down 33% this year, 74% off its record. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.27%, or 28.69 points, to 905.46.
Bond prices fell as money moved toward stocks, but the dollar resumed its recent rebound, amid further hopes that foreign investors might move some money back toward the U.S.
"It was the opposite action to what we had a few weeks ago, where we kept seeing stocks melt down in the last hour and a half," said Bob Basel, senior listed trader at New York brokerage firm Salomon Smith Barney. "Now we are seeing it melt up in the last hour and a half," as investors funnel money into stocks instead of out.
The main investor focus now is Tuesday's Fed meeting. When the economy was perceived as strong, investors didn't want the Fed to cut rates, because that would have been perceived as a signal of economic weakness. But in the past few weeks, investors have gotten repeated signals of weakness from the economic data itself -- ranging from economic growth statistics to manufacturing numbers to unemployment.
Stocks already have fallen sharply amid fears that the economy might be headed for a so-called double-dip recession, in which it emerges briefly from recession and then falls back in. Only a minority of investors expect the Fed actually to cut its target interest rates again on Tuesday -- it already has cut its base short-term rate to 1.75%, leaving it little room for further cuts.
What investors really are hoping for is a signal Tuesday that the Fed is prepared to cut its target if necessary, perhaps at its September meeting, if the economy continues to show signs of weakness.
"A couple of months ago, if you talked rate cut, it would have been seen as a negative sign," Mr. Basel said. "Probably the most positive sign this time would be no rate cut now, but a signal that they are prepared to do it later. Then if the market rallies, maybe you don't have to do it at the next meeting."
News that inflation declined at the wholesale level reinforced a view that the Fed can afford to cut rates, since inflation remains tame. It also reinforced worries about the economy, since it suggests that companies don't have the ability to raise prices as a way of boosting profits.
Word of the Brazil package helped beleaguered U.S. banks such as Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, since it reduced the risk that they would have to deal with more bad Latin American debt.

When investors are pulling back from stocks, they tend to look past good news and focus on the bad. Right now they are doing the opposite, which is a sign that they want
to push stocks higher.
Retailer Best Buy, for example, sharply cut its profit forecast for the current quarter, reinforcing fears that consumers may finally be cutting back on spending, which would hurt the economy further. Other retailing stocks fell on that news, but several managed to rebound into positive territory late in the day.
Outside the U.S., stock prices advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 1.55%, or 1.66 points, to 108.87.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.65 billion shares traded, 2,224 stocks rose and 995 fell.
Bonds declined. The 10-year Treasury note fell 11/32 point, or $3.4375 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to 4.398%. The 30-year bond was down 6/32 point, to yield 5.228%.
The dollar strengthened. Late in New York, it traded at 120.98 yen, up from 120.35, while the euro fell against the dollar to 96.66 cents from 97.45.
