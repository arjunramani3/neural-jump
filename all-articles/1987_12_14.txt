Last Week’s Resilience Inspires
Investors to Send Stocks Soaring
ABREAST OF THE MARKET
By Douglas R. Sease
Inspired by the stock market’s strong performance last week in the face of adversity, investors sent stock prices soaring in active trading.
Despite continuing weakness in the dollar, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 65.82 to 1932.86 in a rally spurred by futures-related buy programs and lower oil prices. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners more than 3 to 1. The broader market indices lagged behind the Dow Jones averages, however. Volume totaled 187.7 million shares, up from the 151.7 million Friday.
“Courage begets courage," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer with Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette. He said investors were impressed by the market's resilience last week despite a flow of daunting news, including a weak dollar, higher interest rates and a record trade deficit.
"They’re impressed by the internal action of the market," he said. “It had plenty of excuses to decline last week, but it didn’t. I think now there are quite a few people looking at the glasses and seeing them half full instead of half empty.”
Other analysts said investors were beginning to see some benefit in the lower dollar, especially if it stabilizes soon. J. Warren Hall, head of the funds management division of National Citicorp in Cleveland, said he believes the dollar is nearing its lows.
"It isn’t terribly far from where it’s going and the sooner it gets there the better,” he said, adding that a stable dollar will bring foreign investors back to the U.S. stock market. “The foreign investor has been having his arm cut off an inch at a time" by the weakening currency, he said.
Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co., said downward pressure on stock prices has eased. “The liquidation pressure has been very light," he said. “My guess is that we’ve already seen the peak of tax liquidation.” He said investors apparently are taking advantage of low stock prices to replace stocks they sell for tax losses with other issues.
But some analysts are cautioning that the current rally and the lack of response to the low dollar are simply short-term phenomena. Alfred Goldman, a technical analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said "the dollar has been in free fall for so long that market particpants have grown immune" to further weakness. And he said the Oct. 19 stock market crash and a further decline two weeks ago that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 140 points left the stock market in an oversold position with institutional investors sitting on the sidelines with lots of cash.
It’s those cash reserves that are fueling the current rally, said Mr. Goldman. He warns that when the reserves are exhausted, investors will realize that they’re still in a very difficult environment.
“Enjoy the early Christmas cheer because I think we're going to have a New Year’s hangover." he said.
