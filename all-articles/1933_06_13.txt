High and	Low Prices	
Tuesday, on the New York Stock Exchange. 231 stocks made new highs and no stock made a new low. for the year 1933.
Rapid changes in the Speculative winds, which coincided with the position of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets, brought quick shifts in prices for stocks in yesterday's session. The emphatic strength in the dollar against sterling late in the day brought heavy selling into stocks, and the list suffered a sharp setback, with volume picking up in the decline which took place in the last half hour of trading.
Losses from the day's highs were large. Union Pacific finished down around 5 points from the top; Telephone showed a similar loss, and there^ were .big dips elsewhere. The decline came after an impressive burst of buying, in the middle two hours of the session, had swept railroad shares, and many industrials, to new highs for the current upswing. Trading was heavy, reaching 6,300,000 shares.
The advance in the dollar was continued after the close of the security markets. The abrupt drop in foreign exchanges coincided with reports, from London of efforts being made toward a temporary stabilization of currencies.
The market also had definite adverse news to contend with. A large bank in Battle Creek, Mich., was closed, and a conservator appointed to take over Jts affairs. The struggle in Washington between the President and the Senate, over veterans* payments, was the chief overnight news. Reports of better business from numerous companies, and generally good loadings statements, proved only temporarily stimulating.	.
Selling depressed the bond market, too, only utility obligations managing to hold up. Second-grade railroad issues sagged with stocks. Governments were higher.
Commodities dropped lower in the late dealings. Wheat finished down % to cents a bushel, and corn sagged, too. Cotton was steady most of the day, but closed off 7 to 13 points.
Foreign markets showed relatively small changes. In Paris, the list ranged higher in inactive dealings. Price changes in London were held within narrow limits.
Obtaining a Triple Guarantee
The approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission to the plan of the Reading and the Pennsylvania for unification of their South Jersey lines, reaching seaside resorts, puts West Jersey & Seashore shares in an extremely strong position. The West Jersey is leased to the Pennsylvania for a long term of years on a rental basis equivalent to S3 a share a year —6% on the $50 par value of the stock.
Under the unification plan approved by the I. C. C. the properties of the West Jersey will be merged with the seaside lines of the Reading and the lease of the West Jersey is to be assumed by the new company. The Pennsylvania and the Reading, as well as the new consolidated company, are to back the West Jersey & Seashore lease, giving It a triple guarantee.
The consolidation of the seaside properties will serve as a demonstration of the savings which can be effected through abandonment of non-paying mileage and eliminating competitive service. The territory involved in the Reading and Pennsylvania unification is peculiarly adapted to such a test, and there should be large savings in operating expenses.
Western Union’s Showing
Even without the other income from dividends as result of the extra payment by American District Telegraph, Western Union showed a sharp reversal of earnings in April as compared with April, 1932. Excluding the dividends from the District Telegraph company. Western Union showed net income of $355,507, compared with a net loss of $18,871 in the similar month last year.	.
The Western Union, in making public the actual amount it received from American District Telegraph as result of the extra payment, revealed for the first time the exact amount of its holdings of the stock. They amount to 77,500 of the 99,849 shares outstanding. The District Telegraph company pays regular dividends of $4 annually, and in 1932 had net income equal to $9.71 on the common stock. In prior years it showed an even larger excess of income over annual dividend requirements, so the $15 extra payment, which helped Western Union greatly, was merely dipping into earned surplus, built up in relatively good years.
Western Union’s May showing should be extremely favorable. The company is one of the first to benefit from general business improvement, and due to the relatively small amount of stock outstanding, per share earnings pick up very swiftly.
Steel Scrap Moved Up
Prices for steel scrap in Pittsburgh were jacked up 50 cents a ton in Pittsburgh yesterday, marking a complete reversal of the sagging tendencies which had been in evidence recently. Although no sales were made at the now figure, the quotation was a firm one. The tip-off on the sharp rise in steel production which took place in April and May, was given by the sudden burst of strength in steel scrap prices, which were pushed up steadily. Operations followed the steady upward movement in scrap prices. The new betterment in scrap prices augurs well for the trend of steel production over the nearterm future.
Opening New Rail Line
The Virginian Railway today .starts operating its new 42-mile line, the Guayandot extension, which opens up new and extensive coal areas to the road. The new line carries the road to Gilbert, W. Va., where it connects with the Chesapeake & Ohio and Norfolk & Western, It was built out of earnings, at a cost of roughly $4,500,000, and the road had the benefit of the low costs prevailing during the last two years in its construction.
The new line is particularly helpful to the Virginian as it puts it in a stronger position to compete with the Chesapeake & Ohio for tonnage to Tidewater from the Logan County fields. Including the new link, the Virginian's line to Tidewater from the fields is roughly 135 miles shorter than the Chesapeake & Ohio's route. How much new traffic the link will de-
