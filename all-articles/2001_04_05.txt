The Nasdaq composite, just two days removed from Tuesday's frightening 6.2% tumble, rallied 146.20 points to 1785.00. Adding to the tech-led index's strength was a rating upgrade on Yahoo!, which jumped 22.6%, by analyst Holly Becker of Lehman Brothers. To put the Nasdaq rise in perspective, its close is still lower than the 1840.86 that the index began the week, and is still down nearly 65% from its all-time high reached about a year ago. Just as a 20% drop from a high is considered the barometer of a bear market in an index, the bear label wouldn't be removed unless the index were to rise at least 20%.
The Dow industrial average's eye-catching point jump represented only about half the percentage jump of the Nasdaq. The index advanced 4.2% to 9918.05. While it wasn't one of the biggest one-day percentage moves in the industrial average's history, which is much longer than the Nasdaq's, it was the fifth-best percentage gain since 1990. For the record (even though percentage moves matter more than points), it was the second-best point gain, behind only the 499.19-point gain on March 16 of last year.
It is clear that yesterday's gains are no guarantee of things to come. To wit: 15 of the Nasdaq's 17 best one-day gains took place during the past year, even as the market was in the midst of its bear-market downturn. In fact, the last time the Nasdaq gained about 8% in a day, in October of last year, it proceeded to give the gains right back in just 16 days. As for the Dow, after it banged out its best-ever 499.19- point gain on March 16 of last year, it took less than a month to register its biggest-ever one-day drop, of 617.78 points, on April 14.

Stocks scored some of their best one-day gains in recent years, as investors, desperate for signs that the market's relentless downturn might be over, jumped on hopeful news from Dell Computer and Alcoa.
But was the market flashing a one-day head fake or beginning a lasting comeback? While the powerful rally was encouraging -- highlighted by the Nasdaq Composite Index's third-best percentage gain ever, at 8.9%, and a 402.63-point rally for the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- similar gains in recent months have typically been followed by more sharp losses for stocks.
Indeed, unless investors hear additional good news from other leading companies in the days ahead, the market may not be able to build on the gains. Some analysts warned that yesterday's performance owed as much to short-sellers, who had bet against the market and scrambled to close out their positions by buying shares, as to any growing belief that the market is set to launch a sustainable rally. The level of short-selling activity on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market stood at record highs as of the latest monthly disclosure, for mid-March.
The Nasdaq composite, just two days removed from Tuesday's frightening 6.2% tumble, rallied 146.20 points to 1785.00. Adding to the tech-led index's strength was a rating upgrade on Yahoo!, which jumped 22.6%, by analyst Holly Becker of Lehman Brothers. To put the Nasdaq rise in perspective, its close is still lower than the 1840.86 that the index began the week, and is still down nearly 65% from its all-time high reached about a year ago. Just as a 20% drop from a high is considered the barometer of a bear market in an index, the bear label wouldn't be removed unless the index were to rise at least 20%.
The Dow industrial average's eye-catching point jump represented only about half the percentage jump of the Nasdaq. The index advanced 4.2% to 9918.05. While it wasn't one of the biggest one-day percentage moves in the industrial average's history, which is much longer than the Nasdaq's, it was the fifth-best percentage gain since 1990. For the record (even though percentage moves matter more than points), it was the second-best point gain, behind only the 499.19-point gain on March 16 of last year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index yesterday rose a similar 4.4%. But like the Nasdaq, it will need to rally hard to cast off its bear-market status. It remains 24.6% off its high. In contrast, the industrial average hasn't closed in bear territory in the latest market pullback and stands 15.4% off its high.
Treasury bonds fell and the dollar was mixed.
"One day doesn't make a trend. We're going to have to see improving fundamentals" for stocks before the rally can continue, said Keith Brickman, head of Nasdaq trading at Morgan Stanley. "It's premature to say it's a bottom" for stock prices. News after the close of regular trading that Sycamore Networks, a leading fiber-optic-equipment maker, would report lower third-quarter sales than expected, sent the company's stock lower in after-hours trading and did nothing to convince the skeptics that the rally will continue.
Mr. Brickman said some of the buying reflects anticipation the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates before the next Fed meeting in late May.
"We're forming a bottom for many large-tech stocks and the S&P 500, but that's not to say we're going to take right off again," said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management.
For a day at least, investors were heartened that Dell, a Nasdaq tech bellwether, had announced that it would meet its previously lowered first-quarter earnings and revenue targets. Sure, the computer concern said personal-computer sales remain soft and said there were no guarantees the rest of the first quarter wouldn't see a falloff in sales. Dell executives gave no assurances about how the rest of the year will shake out.
But investors, who had been worried for days that Dell would join the ranks of tech heavyweights to disappoint investors about its earnings outlook, took the news as a reason to begin buying the company's beaten- up shares and all kinds of tech stocks, hoping the market's pain was over. Yesterday, Dell rose 13.5% to $25.19 on Nasdaq.

Whiff of Good News Sparks Strong Stock Rally --- Nasdaq Soars 8.9%, Industrials Jump 4.2%; Skepticism Remains - ProQuest
Another piece of good news came from an Old Economy stock, Alcoa, which announced first-quarter earnings that -- get this -- beat Wall Street's expectations. Bulls interpreted the news to suggest that the economy could be holding up better than thought and that the recent profit downturn is now ebbing, giving the stock market a chance to rebound. Alcoa, a member of the Dow industrials, rose 5.5% to $37.50.
Showing the broadness of the rally, 29 of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials were up, the only exception being a slight drop in McDonald's. Contributing the most to the advance in the industrial average was the $6.21-a-share rise in International Business Machines (a 7% gain), followed by Microsoft, Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, United Technologies and Hewlett-Packard. Microsoft is also in the Nasdaq composite.
It is clear that yesterday's gains are no guarantee of things to come. To wit: 15 of the Nasdaq's 17 best one-day gains took place during the past year, even as the market was in the midst of its bear-market downturn. In fact, the last time the Nasdaq gained about 8% in a day, in October of last year, it proceeded to give the gains right back in just 16 days. As for the Dow, after it banged out its best-ever 499.19- point gain on March 16 of last year, it took less than a month to register its biggest-ever one-day drop, of 617.78 points, on April 14.
So unless there is more positive news in coming days, yesterday's gains could also prove nothing more than a footnote in a larger pullback -- what Wall Streeters call a bearmarket rally. Some analysts were leaving open the possibility that this is real.
"I certainly hope this is the start of something good, earnings expectations are still very weak and dropping, but at least Dell didn't preannounce [bad earnings] again, so maybe the worst of the drop of expectations is over," said Edward Keon, quantitative analyst at Prudential Securities. "If the economy gets better by the end of the year, the stock market will, too. If you can trust earnings, then stocks look quite reasonably priced, but there's no assurance of that."
Some traders also noted that about three stocks rose for each one that declined yesterday, a healthy figure but not quite strong enough to convince skeptics that the bear market is over.
Despite all the cold water thrown on yesterday's rally, some traders said institutional investors were big buyers of a number of beaten-down tech stocks, such as Microsoft, Cisco, Intel and Dell. Volume, while not record breaking, was solid, another good sign.
Yesterday "was a huge move for stocks, but people are saying it's a bounce, rather than the end of the bear market that they dare not miss, like they said in December" when the market soared, said Mr. Paulsen of Wells Fargo. "That's the first step toward a healthy sentiment, where everyone who wanted out is out, and even if we get more bad news, it may not cause much more selling."
Outside the U.S., stocks rose in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, climbed 1.69%, or 2.28, to 136.88.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks soared. On the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.33 billion shares traded, 2,309 stocks rose while 745 stocks fell.
Bonds eased. The 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 invested, to push the yield up to 4.963%. The 30-year Treasury bond was down 14/32 to yield 5.521%.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, the currency was at 89.52 cents to the euro and 124.18 yen, strengthening from 90.16 cents and weakening from 125.49 yen.
