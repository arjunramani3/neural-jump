FEATURES OF THE MARKET.
t&eir coBaiderable follovritag long of Amalgamated Copper for some time past.	'	. ~	\
_ Amalgamated Copper was strong on a renewal of buy-mg said to be part of the Dawson campaign and on the passage of the. fair trial bill by the Montana legislature. From the movement of the stock it looked as if there was some short interest. .
V iAt the opening there was not a great deal to encour-Wgn- the market as London sent a lower range of prices, * the bank statement had. been disappointing and the .——-■of newspaper commenfoverSunday was at least con-yative. Early strength developed, however, in Amalga-/ Copper, which monopolized the attention of the ..... . %?t in the first hour, and this movement soou ex,- Y—to some other industrials, while the tractions adin the face of some obvious profit-taking in B. IL Amalgamated Copper or Sugar would hardly ever l called market leaders, but the traders were not slow in ^resting promising stocks like Missouri Pacific and St. iPaul. Before the afternoon was far advanced they se-J'cured encouraging results. The hardening of the whole -Tist, followed, especially as the street took a cheerful view ^cf the President’s message, although there is unquestion-£ably a large section which recognizes that what are often ■^platitudes in another man are seriously meant in this ^ca^e. The close was generally strong probably influenced ^y .the ease in call money as much as anything else. In etthis instance it looks as if loanable funds had returned to rthe market and broke the rate in spite of a powerful influ-?ence exerted toward keeping it up. The gold engagement /in London was what the market expected as the natural consequence of the remarkable weakness in demand sterling.
Among the railroad stocks St. Paul and Missouri .’Pacific each advanced two points, while gains of a point -•or more were recorded in Pennsylvania, B. A O., Union Pacific, Southern Pacific and the Rock Island issues. Practically every active stock 'made some fractional advance.
The Copper stocks were the star features of the in-/dustrial market, but were closely followed by American ■ Smelting; while Sugar and Stool pfd. were conspicuously -'Strong. Westinghouse Electric made a six point advance and the gas stocks won? firm. The tractions gained *<round with the exception of B. R. T., which was fractionally lower.	*
American Sugar was firm and the Washington speculators who have been buying it lately, ota atill bullish. They believe that the speaker of the lower house is able to force the senate to take action on Cuban reciprocity.
The buying of Smelters seemed to come from quarters where the Guggenheim influence’might be suspected, and it can at least be said that the long-promised dividend has never looked more likely.
* The buying of Westinghouse Electric was accompanied by rumors of some forthcoming extra distribution to stockholders.
The purchases of Rubber Goods were by people who had stock to sell during the recent depression ui industrials.
GENERAL IXFLUKXCKF:
-London was not a very active factor in the trading, but out of the 15.000 shares dealt in for foreign account about 10.000 shares were sales. Nearly all the selling eeexned to come through one house and included princi-■ pally Steel pfd. and Southern Pacific. As the settlement proper begins on Wednesday the foreign transactions may fairly be taken ns the adjustment of the position .with a view to the end of the account. It is expected that Wednesday’s carry-over will show that the boar ac-• count in London has been practically wiped out. *

The mining settlement in Ixnidon commences to-dn.v and the regular settlement on Wedm^iiny. The stock market arranges most of its loans on the third day of the settlement, which is Friday.*and by that time the installment of the Transvaal loan duo to-day will be again available for the money market so that contango rates should rule lower.	■
The banks were the principal lenders of call money during the day. A good supply from Chicago appeared ’ early and this may be said to have to some extent forced the hand of the Now York banks, who have been doing what they could to keep call money firm. The National City Bank is said to have been the leading influence in this respect.
Commission houses as a -whole made a disappointing report on the condition of business. They found-n very poor response to market movements and wore getting very little investment business. They think what little strength there is in bonds represents a long position of the bond houses in anticipation of the January disburse-merits.	*
The general rate in the loan crowd was easier at 5 %, with certainly nn increase in the demand for stocks in spite of the reduction. Pennsylvania, B. A O.. New York Central and Canadian Pacific were all inquired for, but -;did not loan appreciably below the other stocks.
There was a fairly active day’s trading in bonds, with some strength in Steel 5s. Wabash Bs and Tobacco 4s. M. K. A” T. 5s advanced easily on small purchases. •-Government bonds were a shade easier but not active. • Total sales $3,289,000.
• The Weil following, whoso faith has been rather sev-merely tried in the past fortnight, have been told to take ^the bull side until Friday.
The street, as usual, had a very accurate forecast, of ihe President’s message long before that document was published ■
;.	* There was not much sign of the usual Gould brokers
yin the trading.

INDUSTRIALS.
H. Thomas and A. A. Housman had about the Wpst considerable buying orders in Amalgamated Copper, but’thc appearance of Flowcr.& Co., who used to do some ttflflie Standard Oil business in that stock, attracted some Attention. Tho.theory in some quarters seems to bo that n is employed to manipulate to conceal tho opera' of .n more important interest.

Steel issues acted better than might have MU.expected and it is thought by some fairly good mar-^et'ijudges that tho earnings for the December quarter -"•ite found to have been discounted when they aro pub-r 1.
