London Stocks
Steady Following Initial Weakness
Rally in Gilt-Edged Group Aids Sentiment — Oils Are Heavy
Industrial Movements Small
From Thb Wall SiiifiRr JuinvAt. London Bureau
LONDON — The stock market remained under the depressing influence of Far Eastern and Balkan uncertainties, but after an initial precautionary marking down in quotations, steadied in later dealings following a rally in the gilt-edged group. Long-dated British funds recovered to Thursday’s closing levels, while foreign bonds were unchanged after initial hesitancy.
Industrial movements were small. Kaffirs closed steady, but tin and rubber shares eased in the absence of support. Oils were heavy, while domestic rails were steadier.
