Abstract
Though sharpest for technology shares, the selling has been across the board. General Electric, which rose 50% in the second half of 1999, plunged $6 to $144, wiping $20 billion off its market value. Qualcomm, which rose more than tenfold last year, sank $17.25 by the regular 4 p.m. Nasdaq close to $162.0625 and an additional $4.0625 to $158 in after-hours trading -- for a total loss in market value of $14 billion . Financial shares were especially hard hit by rate worries. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter shed $10 to $125.
Doug Cliggott, strategist at J.P. Morgan & Co., notes that the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which banks lend to each other and is the most sensitive indicator of Fed policy, over the course of last week fell to 2% from 4%. But this week, with none of the feared Y2K-related computer chaos materializing, it has shot up to 5.5%, the Fed's official target.
Bond yields fell, as President Clinton's nomination of Alan Greenspan to another four-year term as Fed chairman lifted bond prices (which move opposite to yields). But that only partly retraced Monday's rise, and yields remain near twoyear highs. Mr. Cliggott thinks the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index, which fell 55.8, or 3.83%, to 1399.42, will be 7% lower by year end.

In an ugly start to the millennium, stocks took their worst drop in more than a year, as a darkening interest-rate picture and tax related-selling interrupted the blissful conditions behind December's rally.
The selloff was hardest on the Nasdaq Composite Index. It plunged a record 229.46 points to 3901.69, and its 5.55% drop was its eighth worst ever. But it pales next to last year's 85.6% rise.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 359.58 points to 10997.93, bringing its two-day decline for this year to nearly 500 points. Yesterday's drop was hardly historic in percentage terms at 3.17%, but it was the largest one-day decline since September 1998.
Most on Wall Street are calling the market's fall a well-deserved bout of profit-taking. Stocks have consistently rebounded from worse falls in recent years. Still, some see more ominous signs in a deteriorating interest-rate picture and the breadth of the selling.
Though sharpest for technology shares, the selling has been across the board. General Electric, which rose 50% in the second half of 1999, plunged $6 to $144, wiping $20 billion off its market value. Qualcomm, which rose more than tenfold last year, sank $17.25 by the regular 4 p.m. Nasdaq close to $162.0625 and an additional $4.0625 to $158 in after-hours trading -- for a total loss in market value of $14 billion. Financial shares were especially hard hit by rate worries. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter shed $10 to $125.
"A lot of the names that didn't participate in the runup are participating in the decline," said Dan Mathisson, head of U.S. stock trading at D.E. Shaw Securities.
Many are dismissing the selloff as temporarily driven by investors who didn't want to trigger taxable capital-gains last year. "You've had some people make some unconscionable profits since the beginning of October," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., market-analysis firm. "People who sold today have 15 months before they have to discuss their profits with the IRS."
Others point to the troubling outlook for interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised rates three times last year out of concern the hot economy would generate inflationary pressure. But in December, it kept rates steady and pumped liquidity into the banking system to meet any Y2K-induced demands for cash.
Doug Cliggott, strategist at J.P. Morgan & Co., notes that the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which banks lend to each other and is the most sensitive indicator of Fed policy, over the course of last week fell to 2% from 4%. But this week, with none of the feared Y2K-related computer chaos materializing, it has shot up to 5.5%, the Fed's official target.
"The funds rate is indicative of the supply and demand for money," said Mr. Cliggott. "The Fed was supplying tremendous amounts of money in the run-up to the calendar date change and it looks like this week, they're not."
Bond yields fell, as President Clinton's nomination of Alan Greenspan to another four-year term as Fed chairman lifted bond prices (which move opposite to yields). But that only partly retraced Monday's rise, and yields remain near twoyear highs. Mr. Cliggott thinks the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index, which fell 55.8, or 3.83%, to 1399.42, will be 7% lower by year end.
Yet most on Wall Street appear sanguine.
"The market has been ripe for a huge shakeout for quite a few months," said Ciaran O'Kelly, co-head of listed trading at Salomon Smith Barney. "I don't believe there's any investment professional on the globe who can claim to be truly surprised by today's sell-off."
"We feel pretty good overall about things, but obviously I don't like days like today," said Charles Betz, managing director at Cornerstone Capital Management, an institutional money manager in Minneapolis. His portfolio trounced major market indexes last year thanks to a heavy weighting of technology stocks, such as Motorola, Nortel Networks and Cisco Systems, but yesterday they had the opposite effect.
Individual investors likewise appeared unshaken. "For people standing around with cash, now is the chance to get back in" said Dennis Patterson, law professor and technology-stock investor at Rutgers University School of Law in Camden, N.J. "Profit-taking and interest-rate anxieties are just part of the game."

The big question now is whether the game is about to become a losing one. The market is caught in a classic tug of war between interest rates and earnings.
Alan Loewenstein, co-manager of John Hancock Global Technology Fund, is looking forward to a banner round of fourthquarter earnings reports in coming weeks. He noted, for example, that semiconductor-equipment maker Asyst Technologies late Monday "said business is better than we thought, raise your [earnings-estimate] numbers." Yesterday, Asyst jumped $12 to $80.75.
But will the interest-rate picture offset those positives? Bonds are the primary competitor to stocks for investors' dollars. Even though J.P. Morgan's Mr. Cliggott expects profits to climb almost 20% this year, he figures stocks would still have to fall about a quarter to be fairly valued at today's yields.
Interest-rate worries likely will be around for a while. On Friday, the December jobs data will help determine if reports of a strong holiday-shopping season were more than just anecdotal. Investors will have to wait until February for the next meeting of Fed policy makers and a likely move on interest rates.
But Thomas Sowanick, chief fixedincome strategist at Merrill Lynch, said markets already have priced in at least one and probably two Fed rate increases, and thus bond yields probably don't have much further to rise.
The fall in stocks might itself contain the rise in rates. "All the wealth created by the year-end [stock-market] rally caused people's confidence to surge and created a tsunami of consumption," said Tom McManus, strategist at Banc of America Securities LLC. "Now we're seeing the reports of that consumption, people are pushing bond yields up, and that's hurting the stock market."
If indeed a serious correction is under way, inflated Internet stocks are among the most vulnerable. There were signs of that yesterday. FreeMarkets, an onlineauction company that in December rose fivefold in the fourth-largest first-day gain for an initial public offering, announced it had lost General Motors as a client. It sank $63.375 to $278.50, below the $280 where it finished its first day of trading. Even Yahoo!, which hit $500.50 after a Schroder & Co. analyst gave it a price target of $600, couldn't hold the gains. It fell $32 to $443.
Internet stocks didn't fare much worse than the Nasdaq overall. The 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index fell 6.84%, far less than the 18.7% bloodbath on April 19 last year when Internet names led Nasdaq's decline.
And though the Dow industrials and Nasdaq Composite closed near their lows for the session, the selling didn't continue in the first 2 1/2 hours of after-hours trading, where 689 stocks rose and 544 fell.
World-wide, stocks fell in dollar terms. Excluding U.S. stocks, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 5.05 to 190.23.
In major market action:
Stocks fell and bonds rose. The 30-year government bond rose 1 2/32, or $10.625 per $1,000 bond.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at $1.0313 to the euro, compared with $1.0268 on Monday, but rose to 103.29 yen from 101.60 on Monday.
