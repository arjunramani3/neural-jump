THE STOCK MARKET
SHARP RECOVERY
Last day of year on Stock Exchange is characterized by violent rally, which continues practically throughout session—Selling for cash to register losses for tax purposes makes up imp’ortant part, of day’s' dealings—Short interest finds stocks scarce when covering is attempted.
Sales, 1,2H5,7OO shares.
American Smelting at 33% was also unchanged from the previous close. This price is up nearly 4 points from the low of tho week. American International, which led the advance in the industrial group on Friday, was off at 37%.	.

Cash Sales Numerous
of
as
The early trading showed a great number of sales stocks for cash. This was only natural inasmuch .people who wished to establish income tax losses for 1929 had to do so yesterday on a cash basis. Thursday marked last day on which losses could be established in the regular routine manner.	,
Atlantic Gulf Rallies After Making New Low
The whole list showed a decidedly firm tone during the first half hour. After its early 1-eaction to 71%, Atlantic Gulf rallied to 74. Other industrials picked up a point or more. In the rail group Southern Pacific held around 100, while Reading was a point above Thursday's last.
Wall Street ushered out 1920 with a'surprisc party in honor of the bearish contingent which at times assumed almost a sensational nature. From the opening gong it was apparent that two things had happened: First, the pressure to sell securities which had been so insistent for the past month or more had'abruptly ceased; secondly, those who have been trying to buy stocks in quantity during the past few days, for both long and short accounts, had determined to wait no longer but to tmy ar uic market.”
The testimony of keen observers on the floor of the Stock Exchange was unanimous that stocks were becoming increasingly difficult to buy as quotations were ad-! vanced. Apparently, the short interest, both real and! technical, was becoming semi-panicky in its efforts to take ' in stocks, which either had been sold short, or else sold to ( establish tax losses and the re-purchase postponed.

Floating Supply of Steel Common Dwindling
The gain of nearly 5,000 shareholders of record for S. Steel common over the last three months amazed Wall Street. The theory of many traders has been that
the public was being forced out of Steel common. It (would appear, however, that Steel common has been .'forced out of the hands of Wall Street speculators and .margin traders to hands of investors. Steel common is rapidly disappearing from Wall Street. Including stock I purchased by tbe 'Steel management for employes, and (absorbed by the new 5,000 shareholders of record, theoretically something more than 400,000 shares may have from these sources and the thing which has been puz- months. '	' '	>>.•.<<»,i
zling even the most astute financial students—i. c., why, stocks had been depressed so far below’ the levels of real j values—was made clear by the evident anxiety on the part of recent sellers to get their stocks back.	!
It was the rebound from the wind-up of a major bear movement that Wall Street was witnessing. As is usually the case the effect of rising prices was to dissipate tho clouds of extreme pessimism which have been prevalent in the financial situation for many months. The recovery was so swift in so many groups as to encourage heavy profit-taking and to induce fresh short selling on the part of those who have become so familiar with the bear side that they arc unable to adjust themselves to an advancing market. Railway shares, on the whole, played second fid-: die because the industrials which had been most heavily! sold monopolized the speculative limelight.	’°n
■Conservative judges expressed the opinion that while the market might go pomewhat further before being definitely checked, it wa.s a part of wisdom not to follow prices! up from the levels that obtained as the veur closed. They.

Kelly-Springfield Shows Substantial Recovery
Rubbers, steels and a number of specialties became active at advancing prices ■ early in the second hour. Kelly-Springfield common sold at 41. against n low last week of 25%. The ease with which this stock advanced indicated that at least part of the break of a week ago was due to short selling.

Outlook For Rubber Industry
A prominent rubber interest has the following to say .. the recent decl'ne in stocks of this class: “Traders I have sold tire r.to Rs short, indiscriminately.

Earnin'^ Jiave been showing a gain of 81,500,000 monthly over last year.	*
Bears Uneasy Around Noon
I Some of the traders heavily short, of the market | thought the upturn of the first hour was largely a bluff, I but if they needed any further convincing it was fur’ nished Jliem around mid-day. The market fairly boiled a' cm t'n'C “nt! "‘'C JUSt	us tllc industrials.
, At 81 ,t U.S, Steel common was up 5 points from the low ! of last week. Southern Pacific nt 101 % made a new high on tne recovery and is also JO points above the recent (low. Baldwin led the equipments with sales above 89. (The jumps between sales in some of the specialties proved ■ mighty discouraging to those fighting the rise.
I A. I. €. Up On Advance In Related Stocks j American International was naturally helped by the I advance in the stocks of the companies in which it has I a large interest. Following its 5-point advance on Thursday, A. I. U. ran.up 3 points to 40%. This company is l a large holder ot U. 8, Rubber common and this stock iran up to 04%. compared with a recent low around 53 (Another stock in which it has a large interest, United bruit got Close to 200. The 100% stock dividend comes off United Fruit shortly.
,	James B. Forgan Optimistic Over 1921
i T he advance was helped by the optimistic utterances i o- Chicago banker.--. The statement of James B. Forgan was particularly impressive. He said that 1921 promises I t0 •™ar ‘,f •steai,y tlwuKh possibly slow improvement. I Sterling exchange continued to show „ steady tone | holding above $3,53. There was no change in the call j money rate.
I	Market Continues Strong
Prices continued to advance vigorously in the early afternoon despite the extensive character of the recovery duinng the morning hours. Steel common kept the leadership, advancing to 81% on a heavy turnover. Atlantic Gulf recoiled sharply from its early display of heaviness recovering to 77 from the morning low of 71%. Baldwin’ spurted 3% to 87; American Car & Foundry 2% 'to 121%-Smchur selling with the 2% stock dividend off" advanced 2% to *.4.and Corn Products to 68%.
Houston Oil Spurts
A scattered short interest experienced difficulty in covering Houston Oil commitments. The stock jumped 8 points t.o 70 in a few sales following announcement by Dow, Jones & Co., of the bringing in of another 2,000 barrel well on the company’s own acreage in Liberty County. Texas. At one time there was only 100 shares of stock on the specialist’s books between 70 and 100. Some of the best oil men in the country are said to have been quietly buying Houston stock on the basis of geologists’ estimates that the Hull pool, which is owned almost en-
tirely by Houston Oil Co., will be good for many years to come.
Profit Taking At Close
Profit taking at the close was the natural sequence of the sharp advances earlier in the session and the final dealings were marked by a reaction from tho day’s highest levels. Steel common sold off to SI; Studebaker to 44%; Baldwin to 85; Southern Pacific to 99%; Chandler to 63% and Mexican Petroleum to 15654.
