The U.S. session got off to a sour start after Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average fell Monday 6.4% to its lowest level in 26 years and Hong Kong's stock market slid 12.7% amid concerns that Asia won't be able to avoid the global economic meltdown.

U.S. stocks appeared to be stabilizing after a massive selloff in Asian shares Monday but tumbled to 5 1/2-year lows in a swift, late- day drop that left the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for its worst month since September 1931.
The Dow closed down 203.18 points, or 2.42%, at 8175.77, its lowest close since April 1, 2003. The blue chips were up 2.6% at their intraday high shortly after noon and slid about 423 points, with more than a third of the drop in the last 10 minutes of trading.
"It just felt like buyers walked away," said Nick Kaupp, a trader with Source Trading, who noted end-of-day trading volume was light compared to recent sessions. "It was actually quiet," he said.
Traders spent much of the day weighing fears of global recession against signs of hope for the U.S. financial sector and the housing market. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.18% to 848.92, its lowest close since March 31, 2003, led by basic materials, off 7.4%.
The Dow is down 25% this month; the S&P is off 27%. In September 1931, the Dow fell 30.7%.
The U.S. session got off to a sour start after Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average fell Monday 6.4% to its lowest level in 26 years and Hong Kong's stock market slid 12.7% amid concerns that Asia won't be able to avoid the global economic meltdown. Investors worried that the yen's recent rapid appreciation could harm Japan's export-dependent economy.
The mood improved in the U.S. after the Commerce Department said that after hitting a 17-year low in August, sales of single-family homes rose 2.7% last month, while the median new-home price fell 9.1% from a year earlier and inventories narrowed.
But traders also were looking ahead to the two-day meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers that ends Wednesday. Although many expect the Fed to cut interest rates, some worry that like other Fed moves, it may not be enough to turn the market around.
Many European markets also declined. The Dow Jones Stoxx index of 600 big European companies slid 1.9%.
Asia's declines, which come after punishing losses Friday, signaled that the financial crisis that began with subprime mortgages in the U.S. has moved squarely into the heart of Asia. "We're seeing in a global recession there is no decoupling from the powerful cross-border linkages of trade flows, capital flows, labor flows and information flows," said Stephen Roach, Asia chairman for Morgan Stanley.
Only South Korea defied the trend, closing modestly higher after the central bank announced a surprise, three-quarter percentage-point rate cut.
Gloom mounted over Japan's banks after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan's largest lender, said it would raise as much as $10.7 billion in capital through share issues within the next year. Until recently, Japan's banks appeared to be among the world's strongest.
The surging yen prompted finance chiefs from the Group of Seven industrialized nations to warn that recent "excessive volatility" in the yen threatens the global economy and financial system. The yen rose against the dollar for the fifth straight session.
The Nikkei is now at its lowest level since October 1982, when Japan was on the eve of an export-led boom that culminated in the burst of its stock-and-real-estate bubble in the early 1990s. Japan's dependency on exports for growth makes it vulnerable to currency fluctuations and economic downturns in overseas markets. In 2007, exports were responsible for 67% of Japan's gross domestic product growth. In morning trading Tuesday, the Nikkei was down an additional 1%.
Other fears have dealt a blow to Asian markets this month. Losses from leveraged currency positions revealed by Citic Pacific, a Hong Kong-listed conglomerated backed by Chinese state money, have made investors nervous about similar undisclosed liabilities on other balance sheets.
