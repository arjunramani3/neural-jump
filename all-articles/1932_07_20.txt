°?m. irUA cJiurta, second from latt pafia.			
Though the commodities markets lagged yesterday, securities continued the upward move. Domestic bonds revealed pronounced strength, with a number of Issues setting new highs on the current upswing. Governments were higher, and only foreign bonds, particularly the German issues, were soft. Wheat and corn were off, and cotton showed ncr pronounced strength.
siock prices retiectcd the revitalizing influence of firmer bond prices, and the increased general demand for bonds inspired by the steady upward march of prices. In a number of Instances, the upswing in bonds has resulted in an appreciation of anywhere from 23% to 100', or more from the lows for the year. Many sound issues still are selling to return a very high yield, nnd with confidence <n the outlook increasing, buying is coming in in greater volume.	w
Karuing*. of National Biscuit Hrttrr Expectation*
The daily crap of earnings reports failed to unsettle the list Some of the statements, particularly that of National Biscuit, were better than anticipated. Biscuit reported far the second quarter a slight gain in per share earnings over the first quarter of the year, and only a small decline ironi tlir like nenod of ,	indicating the staoility of the company’s
earnings power The stock moved up a point or more on the statement.
, Railroad shares were in demand from the opening, with Atchison and Union Pacific the leaders. The manifesto issued by the railroad presidents at the close of the meeting of the Association of Railway Executives gave a temporary fillip to interest m the carrier pecuri-tics. Prospects for better loading* figures served as a sounder basis for renewed Interest m the carrier shares.
Publication of the weekly figures on electric output, recording another big decline from the like week a year ago, exerted no restraining influence on the securities markets. Output for the week end 'd July 16 was down 13.9', from the like week .t year ago, one «»f the heaviest percentage detlmo yet recorded The central industrial region continues to sIioa th** greatest slacking off from a year ago
As something oi an ufi'-ct to this unfavorable index, increa.-c in cement prices at St Louis was welcome news. The increase, made
the Missouri Portland Cement Co. comes on the heels of an advance made in Kansas City, which put prices up from 75 cents to SI 25 a barrel

could fall almost 30% below the total for the corresponding half of 1931, and still be sufficient to cover the annual dividend requirements on the common stock, at the current $2.50 rate.
The serious effect of the further shrinkage in gross revenues in June was reflected strikingly in net operating income. Gross for the month was down roughly 33%, from June, 1931, compared with a drop of 21.5% in gross for tbe half year. Net operating Income was around 50% under the June, 1931 figure, while for the six months, net operating income was dov/n only about 16%.
Wall Street Watching
German Political Trend
The reaction in German external bond issues, following the upswing during the Lausanne conference and immediately after announcement of the accord, has been due to disturbed political conditions in the Reich, which have led to a state of practical civit war. The approaching elections, due to be held on July 31, may mark a distinct turn in the affairs of the Reich, and Wall Street is watching the trend of political events in Germany closely.
The misery which many in Germany have been forced to endure in the past few years has led to an almost unprecedented prolongation of political bitterness. The settlement at Lausanne paved the way for a turn for the better in Germany’s affairs. A swing to the more conservative elements in the Reich in the election could only be regarded as auguring well for the immediate future of Germany, but the outlook now is distinctly uncertain. In past elections, tbe Germans have steadily supported the conservative side.
Stock Prices Again At Crucial Point
The sustained advance in bond prices, which bas carried the Dow-Jones average of 40 corporation issues substantially above the figure reached on the recovery in early June, remains the biggest factor in lending firmness to stock prices. Further gains in bonds should be followed by higher prices for stocks. So far, the stock market has practically* ignored the poor second quarter earnings reports, and there has been good buying on set-backs.
At yesterday’s close, the Dow-Jones average of 30 industrial stocks again had reached the 45-46 level, where increasing resistance has been encountered in previous recovery moves Ability of stocks to push through this area would be regarded as indicating a further advance.
Pressure Is Increased On Tin Plate Price*
While tin plate prices have been steady since earlv this year, pressure on the present scale has increased lecently. and there is a possibility of a downward revision, although it is unlikely to conic until later this year. Usually, change* are made in tin plate prices only once a year.
Can companies base prices for their products largely on tin plate prices, thereby’ protecting their margin, of profit to a large extent. However. a cut in tin plate prices brings about a reduction in prices for cans, and a cut m the dollar volume of can company earnings The cut in dollar volume of earnings can only be offset by reductions in ’operating expense? of the can-making companies, which already have been slashed drastically.
The last cut in tin-plate price* went In’o effect at tne start of this year, and ha« brought about a reduction of around 3' ■ in dollar volume of can company gros* business so far thi. year, in addition to the shrinkage resulting from the general slump in business.
