Domestic Beet Sugar Outlook— .
Substantial improvement in operations of the domestic beet sugar industry is in prospect as a result of a larger crop this season and increased returns to processors ordered by the Government. The beet companies, such as Great Western Sugar Co. Holly Sugar Corp . and American Ciystal Sugar Co. have shown lean earnings for the past three years due to short crops and restricted profit margins The Government recently granted increased returns to the beet companies on both the 1945 and 1946 beet crops The Commodity Credit Corp will waive its recovery of sugar price increases from beet processors to the extent of 13 34 cents per 100 pounds on the entire 1945 crop On the 1946 crop, the C C C will guarantee the companies’ return* that aie 35 cents per 100 pounds greater than on the 1945 crop
Harvesting of the 1946 production will get under wav on a larger scale late in September following excellent growing conditions l! normal sugar yields are realized it is estimated p:eduction will be around 1 7 million shoit tuns of sugat. raw value, compared with output of only 1.273 000 tons last season The Drpat tment of Agriculture has increased the 1947 acreage goal for the beet industry to 1 057,000 arrrs ’ Under norma! conditions this might yield around 1 9 million tons of sugar late next year, a recoid production for the industry
Bert sugar distribution in the first six months of the jean, was almost 17', ahead of the sinulai period in 1945 due partly to a moderate increase m production last tall and the fact that special shipments aie being made into the East, where cane refined sugar supplies aie short
The beet industry is making rapid strides towards mechanization ot harvesting operations, which pi onuses a considerable reduction in costs over the longer term. It will also place the industry in a better competitive position in i elation to the cane producing industry in Cuba. Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and the continental United States
Allen Industries, Inc.—
I Improved earning* recently icpoited by Allen Industries. Inc. for the second quarter are being viewed as a reflection of the company's gradually increasing sales to the automotive industry While the company does a substantial business in floor coverings for homes, about 65'fr of its total volume is normally with automobile companies. With the latter continuing to increase their production rates, prospects are that Allen Industries will show a 1 inther improvement in earnings in the third quarter.
Supply of most raw materials the company requires for automotive products is now reported satisfactory. These matenals include cotton linters, cotton waste, jute and burlap, with the automobile companies usually supplying their own upholstery cloth to Allen for sewing and assembly largest customers are General Motors and Ford. In order to supply j several branch assembly plants ot the latter, {Allen leased a plant m St. Laui* which i* now getting into ptoduction.

National Lock Co. i68.4% owned) and Mid-Slates Steel & Wirt Co 177 2', owned) may increase their dividend payments.
