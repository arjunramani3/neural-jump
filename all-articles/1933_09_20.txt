. Heaviness in commodities, and a declaration from Secretary Wallace, opposing uncontrolled inflation and price-fixing, dampened inflationary interest in stocks yesterday. The market was called on to absorb two waves of moderately heavy selling in the morning, and the list was at the lows at the close. V. S. Smelting showed the biggest loss, off 8%, and declines elsewhere ran up to 4 points. Trading totaled 2,420,000 shares.
- Secretary Wallace's speech, and Senator Pittman's statement, indicated quite clearly that the Administration is determined to give its policy of credit expansion, and the steps taken under the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, a full try-out That of course, is a disappointment to those clamoring for the debasement of the currency.	"
' As a group, the tire company shares showed greater buoyancy than any other. Reports from abroad told of the agreement by both Dutch and British interests for steps to restrict rubber production. A plan has not yet .been worked out, but is being undertaken. The metal and the oil shares met support on the reactions, while the utilities and the rails, in spite of good output and loadings reports, were heavy most of the session.
Heavy selling swept the bond market to lower ground. The day was a repetition of previous trading sessions. All groups of domestic corporation issues dropped lower, the blue ribbon bonds suffering the most. Speculative industrial .bonds did better than other classes. Gold bloc bonds were strong again, helped by the new high for the price of gold and strength in foreign currencies against the dollars.-
Wheat traveled over a range of a little more than 2 cents a bushel and finished not far above the lows, off 1% to 2 cents. Other grains followed the lead of the major cereal. The cotton market was erratic. The early break carried cotton off around $2 a bale, but it rallied from the lows, only to dip again and finish down $2 a bale.	(
Mining shares were higher on the London market, and oil stocks were firmer. The rest of the list, however, was irregular. In Paris, prices were mixed.
Utility Output Gain Wider
Neither the wider gain in utility output in the September 16 week, nor some good earnings reports from individual companies, sufficed to bring any life to the utility group. The output increase was attributed to country-wide poor
’weather, and not to any renewed spurt In industrial activity. A report such as that turned in. by Public Service of New Jersey, however, should attract more attention. In August, the company had surplus after charges of $1,735,084, a gain of more than 25% oyer the corresponding month of 1932.
Students of ths utility situation feel that rate reduction agitation has passed its peak. The bogie in the utility situation now is the prospect of a long upward swing in commodity prices. The difficulties of the utility companies in the previous period of sharply rising commodity prices are fresh in. the minds of many. Their'timc of greatest prosperity came in the years between 1924 and 1929, when commodity prices actually were in a slow, downward sag, while industrial production was on the increase. Selling in the utilities, both from holders in this country and abroad, has been heavy recently, and swishing from that group to others has been carried on day after day. The Dow-Jones utility average, in spite of the improvement scored by many utility companies, is now under the level at which it stood a year ago.
Dahl’s Salary Pared to $40,000
A reduction to $40,000 a year brings the salary of Gerhard M. Dahl, chairman of the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corp., more in line with compensation paid to other executives in the utility and the railroad field.
In each of the years 1930 and 1931, Mr. Dahl received total compensation of $225,000, and in 1932, up until August, he was being paid at the rate* of $150,000 a year. The cut in Mr. Dahl's salary of $185,000 from the amount he received in 1930 and 1931 means about 25 cents a share on/ B.-M. T. common, no negligible amount.	.
Secretary Wallace Speaks Out
Secretary Wallace’s forthright declaration on the subject of inflation and price fixing, coupled with Senator Key Pittman's report of his conversation with the President, served to dampen the ardor of those who have been buying stocks on the theory that currency inflation was only a stride or two ahead. In his speech before the Grain Dealers’ Association in Chicago, Mr. Wallace reiterated his stand favoring controlled Inflation, but he talked realistically about the long-term outlook, and the need for eventual adjustment in the economy of this country to make it jibe with our position in the international picture.
For those who cling to some of the old ideas of economics, Secretary Wallace’s declaration was one of the most helpful utterances which has come from an Administration leader. His rejection of the idea that wild inflation is a cure for the economic ills of this country was a comfort.	'
.	General Foods Sales Advance
Unit sales of General Foods in August, to domestic customers, were about 20% ahead of the total for August, 1932. In the eight months, volume ran 16% ahead of the corresponding months of the previous year. Sales have shown a consistent improvement from month to month so far this year. The pick-up in the company’s business got under way at the close of December, 1932.
