stock over*
a Break in cotton, yesterday, brought on a wave of selling in the stock market which ended in losses of one to four points for leading Issues. At noon, publication of the government forecast on the cotton crop surprised the trade with a figure 500,000 bales larger than it had been anticipating. Futures broke more than 80 points under the wave of selling which followed this forecast, and though they rallied later, prices ended the day with substantially greater losses than those recorded in the initial sethark
The stock market had been active through the morning, without making much progress. With this unfavorable development a large volume of selling orders was thrown upon the market, which caused the leading issues to back away for a point or two. Professionals who had been anticipating a sizeable reaction after the extended advance, offered stock freely, but the market recovered.
It was the second wave of selling In cotton and in the share market which brought on the more substantial losses. Volume picked up on the downside. American Telephone, Steel common, du Font and other pivotal issues bore the brunt of the drive and ended weak at about the lowest levels of the day.
Grain markets ruled lower most "of the day. Heavy Canadian hedging pressure held prices somewhat lower than the levels of the previous close, and corn and other grains were soft.
The bond market was enlivened by brisk buying of the public utility Issues and by the strength in local traction issues. The latter were higher on prospects that the city’s new administration would hasten unification conferences. Interborough Rapid Transit and Manhattan Railway bonds made moderate gains through most of the day and closed steady. The market as a whole declined slightly.
New 1 ork Central and Pennsylvania Railroad car-loading statistics for the week ended September 3 were fairly encouraging. Both showed moderate gains over the preceding week and a smaller percentage of decline from the corresponding week a year ago.
New England and the South
An analysis of the electric power output figures for the week ended September 3 shows they reflect higher operations in the textile districts. Incrased demand for energy came from the Carolinas, Georgia, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
The improvement in cotton and textiles has penetrated to steel mills in the Birmingham district, where demands for sheets for roofing and wire fence materials have developed a fairly marked upward trend since late in August.	f
Republic Steel Preferred
While speculative activities have been conducted in Republic Steel common recently, a better class of buying has been in the preferred issue which is selling below 30. There are accumulations on this issue which must be paid off before the common can be considered in line for dividends. Thus far there has been only a slight improvement in Republic Steel’s business.
Discrimination in Buying
If business is at the turn, as some believe, and on the way to an extended recovery, it would appear that more than at any time ir the past there is a need for discrimination ir buying equities. Yesterday’s ‘’blue-chips" may not be the leaders in the next few years. During the past few years many companies were more successful than others in getting their affairs in shape for a better demand.
Who Has Been Buying Stocks?
It will, be interesting to see what effect the rise in stocks has had upon the shareholders lists of large corporations when these figures are next made public. For the past three years the number of stockholders has been growing. It has been the experience in U. S. Steel common that some of the smaller Investors sold on the first extended advances which followed past major bear markets. At such times the large investors who buy in large quantities have added to their holdings and the number of smaller stockholders has decreased.
I<ow Prices Aid Snuff Companies
While the snuff companies are having to contend with reduced consumption of their product, July showing an especially drastic drop, the reduced costs of tobacco and other materials entering into the manufacture and sale of snuff were sufficient to offset the lower output in the first half year. George W. Holme and U. S. Tobacco, two of the country’s three leading snuff makers, have large security holdings, the income from which has tended to stabilize .earnings regardless of consumption fluctuations.
