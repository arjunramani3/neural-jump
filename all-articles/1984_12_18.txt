Abstract
The message that the Federal Reserve System is easing credit finally got through to Wall Street in a big way yesterday, as sinking interest rates propelled the stock market to an almost 35-point rise, the biggest one-day increase since Aug. 3.
All industry groups but oil participated in the first broad market rally since a 120-point move that began at the end of July and peaked in early November. The market had since given up about half that advance. Technology and semiconductor stocks, which had been weak, led yesterday's increase.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 34.78 points at 1211.57, the seventh-biggest one-day increase ever. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 169.1 million shares, the sixth-highest ever and the most since Oct. 19. The record of 236.6 million was set Aug. 3. Yesterday's composite volume was 195.5 million.

The message that the Federal Reserve System is easing credit finally got through to Wall Street in a big way yesterday, as sinking interest rates propelled the stock market to an almost 35-point rise, the biggest one-day increase since Aug. 3.
All industry groups but oil participated in the first broad market rally since a 120-point move that began at the end of July and peaked in early November. The market had since given up about half that advance. Technology and semiconductor stocks, which had been weak, led yesterday's increase.
Meanwhile, bond prices jumped, as some actively traded U.S. government issues rose more than three-quarters of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 34.78 points at 1211.57, the seventh-biggest one-day increase ever. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 169.1 million shares, the sixth-highest ever and the most since Oct. 19. The record of 236.6 million was set Aug. 3. Yesterday's composite volume was 195.5 million.
"Obviously money has become significantly easier, and I think that's the most important single thing today," said Peter Vermilye, chairman of Endowment Management & Research Corp., a Boston money-managing concern.
Under growing pressure from the Reagan administration, which has argued that the Federal Reserve held credit too tight too long last summer, the Fed has been letting short-term interest rates drift downward for several months. The rate on 13-week Treasury bills was about 7.75% yesterday, down from an average of nearly 10.5% in August.
Even so, investors have been skeptical as to how far the rates would be allowed to fall, and whether the drop would be sufficient to prevent a recession next year. Recently, however, the pace of interest-rate declines has accelerated, and hopes are growing for a new cut in the discount rate that the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions.

Moreover, the continuing slide in the price of gold and the firmness of the dollar (although it slipped a bit yesterday) have helped dispel fears of a new round of inflation.
As a result, the conviction is mounting that interest rates can and will continue to fall enough to ensure continued growth in the economy next year. And that was a major factor behind the explosions in the stock and bond markets yesterday.
The softness in interest rates, particularly seen in short-term issues, was highlighted by the action of the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans. Federal funds dipped to as low as 5% yesterday, down from about 7.73% Monday. Some Treasury rates were at their lowest levels since early 1983.
Bankers Trust Co. yesterday cut its prime, or base, lending rate by one-half percentage point to 10 3/4%, following a move made late Monday by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. That move had kicked the industrial average up about seven points in the last 15 minutes of Monday's session, and led many investors and analysts to expect a strong market performance yesterday. They weren't disappointed.
"Almost every group was running strong," said Dudley Eppel, chief equity trader for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. "Investors just came in to buy . . . right at the start, and they never stopped. It sure looks like a strong rest of the week."
The prices and volume of stock-index options and futures also surged. Volume records were set for the Standard & Poor's 100-stock index option traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the American Stock Exchange's Major Market Index option. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange estimated that its Standard & Poor's 500-stock futures contract also set a volume record.
Options are agreements allowing an investor to buy or sell something within a stipulated time and for a certain price.
The stock-index contracts have been in the spotlight lately, because of what many believe is an upsetting effect they can have on stocks at expiration. Sophisticated investment strategies that involve both the index contracts and the underlying stocks can cause sharp price movements, as the stock portion of the position is closed out at the expiration of the index contract. Several of the stock-index contracts expire Friday.
However, recent publicity has prompted many arbitragers to leave the market on those contracts early or to roll their positions into later months. This factor helped clear the way for yesterday's market rally, said Gregory Kipnis, manager of index futures and options at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
