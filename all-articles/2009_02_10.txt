Budding rallies in the stock and corporate-bond markets took a hit as investors lamented the lack of detail in Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's plan to rescue the banking system.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had begun to rebound last week on hopes that government stimulus plans around the globe might fuel economic recovery, fell
381.99 points, or 4.62% to 7888.88.
The Dow is down 44% from its 2007 record close, at its lowest finish since the five-year closing low of 7552.29 on Nov. 20. The November decline was fueled by the Treasury Department's failure to carry out plans to buy troubled securities that clog the banking system, an issue similar to the one that sent markets down again now.
Corporate bonds and mortgage-based bonds, which also had been recovering lately, suffered as well. Money flowed back to the relative safety of Treasury bonds, pushing Treasury prices higher and yields lower. Until Tuesday, Treasury prices had been falling as investors moved money toward riskier bonds with higher yields.
The buildup to Mr. Geithner's speech had fueled hopes he would provide reassuring details about how the Obama administration planned to get credit markets functioning properly.
"The expectation on the Street was that we were going to get some meat, and we really didn't get that meat," said Bill Greiner, chief investment officer at UMB Asset Management, which oversees $9.5 billion in Kansas City, Mo.
Mr. Greiner's funds are holding an average of 10% to 20% of their assets in cash, roughly double their normal levels. Until he sees how credit markets and the economy are going to get back to normal, he said, he isn't prepared to risk that money on stocks.
Shares of banks, which had been recovering on expectations that the government would be taking their troubled investments off their hands, fell hard. Bank of America tumbled 19% and Citigroup declined 15%. Regional banks fell even more, with KeyCorp down 27%.
