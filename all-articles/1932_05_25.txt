Complete tabulation of tee Doto-Jonee etook overages, with Obarte, ascoad from lost papa.
After suffering an early setback, wheat prices rallied in Chicago yesterday, but the spurt in the major grain was about the only cheery development affecting the day's markets. It was not sufficient to alter the present indigo atmosphere In Wall Street, and prices for securities were marked down severely, with leadins: stocks Iosins anywhere from a fraction to more than three points. Volume was double that of Monday, and above Tuesday’s figure.
Government bonds were irregular, but acute weakness developed in the domestic list, a number of issues setting up new lows. Domestic bonds were pressed for sale, and purchases were made only at sharp price concessions by tbe sellers.
In stocks, the weakest groups were the food company and the tobacco shares, which so far have held up the best in the long decline. In many quarters, weakness in these Issues was attributed to the selling of stocks which had held up the best to protect accounts hard hit by weakness in other securities. New lows in the food group were numerous, Borden’s, National Dairy Products and General Foods all declining abruptly. Both Borden's and National Dairy Products have been affected by increasing competition from independents, and the trend of prices for their products has been lower.
Tobaccos were adversely affected by the declining consumption of cigarettes, clearly shown by the April figures, and by prospects for no change in the current downtrend.
New York traction stocks, too, were under pressure. At slightly above 27, Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit common is selling for less than five times reported net income per share for the 10 months ended April, and B.-M. T. preferred, at yesterday’s close, sold to yield 11.3% on tbe current 36 rate.
Washington news was hardly an important factor in the day’s developments. A new unemployment relief measure, the fruit of Democratic consultations, was presented in the Senate. The provision covering a $500,000,000 bond issue for construction of Federal projects already authorized had an adverse effect on the Government list. Washington opinion now aeems to be that the Congress will pass a measure with a bond issue provision, despite the Administration's opposition. Senatorial progress on the tax bill continued at a pace wholly consistent with the dignity of that body.
Indications of Another Market Climax
The sharp increase in volume yesterday indicated that the market might be approaching another climax. Tuesday’s total of 1,000,006 shares was almost double Monday’s transactions. and yesterday s total was 1,300,000 shares, or 30% more than Tuesday’s trading. In the long decline since early March, the Dow-Jones industrial average has lost, on a percentage basis, approximately the same amount as in the period from the high of September. 1929, to the November low of that year, and the high on the Moratorium rally to the low early last October.	*
Wall Street continues to look to Washington for news. Until something favorable develops from that quarter, or a definite program of action to stem the dofiationary tide is announced by the group of twelve bankers and industrialists recently selected, there is little prospect of a change In tbe character of the markets. Conservative quarters still suggest that investors wait until the skies clear before making any purchases of stocks.
problems which are scheduled for consideration at Lausanne.
If temporizing remains the policy, the outlook for any break in tbe world-wide depression is scant. If concerted action were undertaken to relieve Germany and to solve the Damibian countries' financial problems, the securities markets would be bound to stage substantial recoveries.
North American Cut Bank Debt WfiN.OW
Pressure on North American common recently has carried the stock down to fractionally over 17, compared with a high for the year of 40. The decline has been due, largely* to liquidation of a large block of common.
At the end of March, North American had bank loanB of $13,022,243, but these have since been reduced to roughly $9,200,000.
Output figures of subsidiaries of the North American Co. continue to record declines from the corresponding period of 1931, but m gome quarters the subsidiary companies have been able to stimulate demand for electricity. In Cleveland, for instance, the average kilowatt-hnur use of electricity toy residential customers gained more rapidly in the first quarter of 1032 than In the first quarter of 1931. In Missouri, the residential load has Increased, and the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co. reports an increase In consumption by residential and farm customers. The industrial load of the system continues to reflect the low rate of business activity.

Virginian Ry. Bonds At Discount of 28%
The good railroad bonds, as well as those not so highly rated, have gone down steadily in the heavy decline In the bond market, with investors picking up a bond here and there only at sharp concessions In price. On Tuesday, one Virginian Railway first mortgage 5% bond sold at 72, off 3 points from the previous sale and a new low.
The decline In the bonds is in striking contrast to the earnings showing of the carrier In th(r first quarter. Net income for the period was $718,528, equal, after preferred dividend requirements, to 95 cents a share on the common stock, compared with $664,597, or 78 cents a share, on the common in the first quarter of 1931.
Total debt of the Virginian, including equipment trusts, is roughly $66,600,000. The onlv bonds out are the $55,344,000 first 5s and $5?-000,000 first 4’^s. At current prices for these bonds, the market puts a valuation on the property, exclusive of equipment trusts, of roughly $44,500,000. Behind the bonds are $27,955,000 par value of preferred stock and $31,271,000 of common stock.
In every one of the six years ended 1930, fixed charges were covered twice or better. Even in 1931, the Virginian covered charges about 1.7 times, so that the bonds are still legal investments on the old basis.
In both February and March, gross revenues of the Virginian were ahead of the corresponding 1931 months, due in part to revenues received from surcharges. Both the wage deductions and the surcharges have played a substantial part in the improved net Income showing made by the carrier so far.
Lausanne Conference Three Weeks Away
With the Lausanne Conference only about three weeks away, a hopeful attitude as to the outcome continues to be maintained, but tbe securities markets give no great encouragement to even this position. Although prices for German bonds at the present time are affected by other influences, the recent downtrend reflects, in part, the waning of hopes that European statesmen would take some aggressive action in attempting to solve the financial
