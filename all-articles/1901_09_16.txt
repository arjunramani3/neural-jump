| The strength in St. Patil is a very noteworthy, feature of the market. -It is notoriously not eon-, .trolled by any one interest and lends itself sradijy, to manipulation. with an excellent effect on the restj of, the market. In these circumstances, it is not, surprising that its fluctuations have been wide and that it was the first stock to advance. All the other possible market leaders tire now more or less’ 'controlled, and movements in them are regarded to some extent as being made on a limited minority stock, where the controlling interest has no desire; to sell, whatever the market movements may be.'
The easing off of money which could be ob-, tained in volume at 24/ as late as 2.30 was an im-l .portant factor.	I

It was evidence of the small short interest infl the stock, that Kock Island advanced, (i points atl the opening on the purchase of 200 shares of stoek.j Trade interests were reported purchasers ofS Sugar on tlie promising outlook for the present! quarter. Demand for all grades of sugar was re-B ported very good.	.	- B
Good lmving was reported in Atcliison. It! was said that E. -1. Berwind’s visit to Europe was! in connection with the recent purchase of llam-B burg-American stock in the Berlin.	S
Amalgamated Copper advanced on what was! considered insiile buying. There was very fair evi-B deuce that a emisiderable short interest had been! created on tlie adverse trade reports.	E
London sold a little stock on the earilyj strength.but bought on balance some GO,000 shares! out of 75,000 dealt ill.. These purchases were wells distributed over the international list.	g
The activity and strength ir. Southern Bails wav was noticeable and was largely based upoi jg the inside buying’and the belief that the price off the common relative to its preferred stock was!

' it was verv gracefully intimated, before the! opening, that the London'Stock Exchange would! close on Thursday next, in sympathy with the! American people in their loss, and to show its re-B spent for- the.dead President.
■It was believed that the plans of the large inforests associated with the Northern l’ncitie position had so far been changed that no rights on Union Pacific for any issue of new stock would be forthcoming in the near future.	■
.The initiative of the London market was a valuable factor yesterday in the advance and tlie inlying on tin* other side, while partly stimulated from New York to a large .extent, proceeded also from London and Continental operators.
Smelters advanced with the rest of tlie market, but one or two blocks of long stock came out from usually well informed quarters. 11 is said that the company.is still smnewbat tied up with its large holding's of lead, which cannot be easily marketed witli the present declining demand.
Tlie severe loss shown in tlie Uepnblie Steel report in consequence of three months’ strike con ditions at tlie beginning of its fiscal .year, has aroused some comment on how the United States Steel Corporation may be affected. Insiders, however, sav that the strike came al exactly tlie right time for the company and that the loss therefrom will be surprisingly small.
The strength of the independent steel stocks was noticeable, the more so that they bail been receiving u good dcul ot business during the strike iwhich would reVert to the United States Steel Co. It was thought, however, that their destination would ultimately be absorption by the larger con-ccrn and in these circumstances there wove a good many bargain hunting purchasers.
The close was very strong, and if not quite at the best of the day, was near it. The volume of I commission buying was very considerably larger dhan had been expected and was sufficiently strong : to absorb realizing of a good deal of stock bought ' to protect lower down. The market was for the • moment governed by n common impulse and iiitli-/ yidual considerations were no factor.
The strength in Manhattan in the dosing quotations was an important feature and was taken ,to indicate that: the change ot traction would be ' discounted in the market. The important sating ' accomplished by Metropolitan in the substitution qf electricity for .cable, as shown in the annual repor, was taken as a guide, and tlie slock was freely bought by the commission houses.
The'opening was very strong, helped by the announceinent of President Roosevelt, s policy, the great strength displayed in London, and the settlement. of the Steel strike. The first-quotations -were from 1 to 5 points above Friday’s elose. . There was a good deal of commission house buy :4n", sufficient in some instances to advance prices ,,without assistance from brokers usually operating
