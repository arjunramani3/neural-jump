THE STOCK MARKET: ACTIVE AND STRONG Advancing movement was well sus-

Except in a few issues selling was absorbed readily and tlie advancing tendency was well maintained. Our Government’s reply to Austria's protest against the shipment of contraband to the Allies was regarded with satisfaction, and it caused a pronounced Advance in the war order issues at the start, although some of these stocks afterwards lost the greater part of their early advances. The largest gain made anywhere was scored by Studebaker, which advanced at one time to 120, and closed at 115, a net gain of 15% points on the day; but the greatest interest was in the strength and activity of United States Steel, which on dealings in nearly 150,000 shares ended at 76%, a gain of 2% points and a close approximation to the year’s high record of 76% reached on Tuesday of last week. Regarded as a reflex of activity In the steel trade, the rise in United States Steel encouraged expecta-
ti<® of an advance in the railroad stocks, as steel products turned out by the mills w_li henceforth add greatly to the traffic of the roads. The advance in Studebaker helped the other motor issues; and Goodrich, which is the largest manufacturer of tires in the world, also participated to a notable extent in the upward movement. In general the market, after displaying pronounced strength in the forenoon, became comparatively dull in the early afternoon, but there was a renewal of pronounced activity and strength in the late trading.
The vigorous buying of stocks just before the close was based on the expectation of success of plans to overcome the difficulty in foreign exchange reflected by a severe break in sterling to new low figures- The Street had begun to argue trat unless the downward movement in sterling we« checked there would be a recurrence of heavy liquidation of European holdings of American securities, and that the buying of American products for export would be limited to the absolute necessities of foreign consumers. These would be bearish factors, and it was to the belief that such unfavorable contingencies would be averted that the market’s renewal of its upward movement at the clo«e was chiefly due.
Transactions totaled 948.241 shares, and gains were general at the end.
l>arge Attendance
Attendance in the commission houses was very large, and although brokers advised caution, and some of tlie more conservative traders were not inclined to enter into commitments, there was evidence of an increased public interest and stocks were bought at the opening by people who were able to satisfy every requirement in regard to liberality of margin.
The Lansing note to Austria was favorably commented upon in every quarter, and it tended to increase bullish sentiment on the war stocks. In response to that factor Crucible Steel opened 1% up at 74 and advanced to 74% on the next sale. Allis-Chulmers gained % by opening at 41, and American Can started with sales from 61 to 61%, compared with 60 at Saturday’s close.
All the Goldman-Sachs stocks were very strong. Continental Can and Goodrich opened a point up while Studebaker, after opening at 102% rose rapidly to 104 compared with 99% at the close on Saturday.
American Car & Foundry and Pressed Steel were active and sentiment was bullish on them as a result of foreign orders for equipment obtained by the former and
the new contract* 'for war applies recently obtained by the latter-	I
Activity in Steel
Activity continued on a large scale to the end of tiwr first half hoar, and although stocks were freely supplied; <m the advance, they were absorbed without difficulty and^ there were no signs of a serious check to the upward move-1 ment.	;
The dealings in United States Steel were very heavy, and the stock advanced to a level above 75 compared with 1 73*% at the close on Saturday. It was predicted that the' earnings for the current quarter would be in the neighbor-' hood of 345,000,000 net, and that the stock would be re-* stored to a dividend basis next winter, if not before. • Willys-Overland sympathized with the advance in Studebaker, and gained about 5 points; while the latter. advanced to 109, compared with 99% at Saturday's dose.' The rise in Studebaker was largely due to the estimate o£ earnings at the rate of upward of 40% made last week* by western interests in the company and contained in a Chicago dispatch to The Wall Street Journal
The dealings in Westinghouse were very large, and the stock shared in the strength of the war issues generally, 1 Advance in Can	I
Towards the end of the first hour the general market1 became a little reactionary and that tendency was not to 1 any extent counteracted by increased bullish activity in. American Can, which carried the price of that issue up to 63, a new high record- The rise in the stock was attributed to the probability that the company will obtain additional war orders which are now the subject of negotiation, and that its profits from this source will be very large.	•
Jesse Livermore who obtained notoriety as a bear operator in the 1907 panic period is understood to be active on the selling side at the present time. His return i to the Street has occasioned surprise, as it was thought i some time ago that on account of his health and other reasons he would not again become a big figure in the' market.	_	i
Tennessee Copper, after an advance to 48%, compared with 44% at Saturday’s close,	"	- -
of its advance, of big profits on of explosives.
Covering: by
Great strength in United States Steel accomplished for the market what could not be done by the rise in American Can, and in the second hour the advancing movement v.*as resumed, and traders who had sold a few stocks short earlier in the session proceeded to cover their commitments.
The hbavy break in the price of sterling convinced the Street of the necessity for the placing of a large British loan in this market, and it was predicted that early announcement of plans to overcome the exchange difficulty would soon be made. In some places it "was said the rate would be as low as 4% *5- and it was generally conceded iii investment quarters that if the bonds bore 5*5- and were made payable in gold there would be an eager demand for them.
A buying movement in Union Pacific which lifted the price more than a point above Saturday’s closing level tended to encourage sentiment and some of the best houses, while impressing upon their customers the need of exercising caution in dealing in many of the industrials, thought the prospects favored a substantial advance m the railroad issues.
Sloss-Sheffield and Great Northern Ore were strong and aetve in the expectation of a large increase in the demand for the raw materials for steel making.
Goodrich Dividend Outlook
Activity slackened in the early afternoon and the buying movement in the railroad issues was suspended for the time being. The market really became a specialty affair, and even m the specialties little was done outside of a few issues.
Goodrich became quite strong and active and traders showed an inclination to follow the movement in it on account of the way in which stocks of other companies financed by the same banking interests have recently acquitted themselves m the market. The earnings of the company arc increasing in a most satisfactory wav, and it is only a question of time until the stock is put back on the dividend list. When that is* done the distributions will probably be at the rate of 5% a year. "
American Car & Foundry, after absorbing a considerable quantity of stock in the neighborhood of 70, resumed its upward movement Conservative houses said there was a demand foi the stock bv people who intended to pay for it and hold it as an investment. The company, which is conservatively managed, has accumulated a very large cash surplus.	’
A Uttle Heart ion
There was a little reaction in the late afternoon, but stocks were wanted on comparatively small recessions, and there were no indications of the culmination of the advance. Traders sold on the assumption that the decline in sterling would result in heavy liquidation for foreign account besides checking the foreign demand for American products, but banking interests thought an arrangement to prevent both those contingencies would soon be perfected. In this connection significance was attached to reports of an important conferen^e attended by such bankers as Frank Vanderlip and Charles Sabin at the offices of J. F. Morgan & Co.
The reaction in some of the war order stocks to about the opening level of prices seemed to indicate that note to Austria had been fairly well discounted.

The buying was founded on expectation sales of sulphuric acid to manufacturers
