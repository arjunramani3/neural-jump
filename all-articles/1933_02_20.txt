A Day of General Selling:
A steady flow of liquidation carried security prices into new low ground for the decline at the outset of the new week. No group of stocks was spared in the general liquidation, and active leaders were off as much as 3 points from Saturday’s final prices. Concurrence by the House in the prohibition repeal resolution brought no recovery in prices; even the ‘'repeal” stocks sold lower on the good news.
It was a day of general selling in bonds. Highest grade rail and public ultility issues were under almost as much pressure as the second-grade obligations. There were sharp breaks in some industrial issues, and Governments showed sizable losses. The foreign department was lower again. Japanese and German bonds leading the decline. British issues were about the only exception to the generally poor tone in the foreign list.
Wheat and cotton showed some stability in the face of • the security market weakness. Wheat closed off only a small fraction, and cotton finished two points higher to three lower.
Bank Situation is Prime Factor
The prime influence on the course of security prices continued to be the general banking situation. After the close. Governor Comstock issued a statement indicating that the Michigan bank holiday very possibly would not be extended beyond tomorrow night. Banking news during the day, and over the week-end, included announcement of closings in Indiana, Minnesota and Maryland.
The market was oblivious to favorable developments which took place. Du Font directors declared the regular quarterly dividend payment, but the stock was lower throughout the session. The report of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway for January* showed a substantial improvement in net, over the like 1932 month, but the stock closed fractionally lower on the day, dropping with the rest of the carrier list.
Particularly weak spots in the list were American Can. Montgomery Ward and the motor shares. General Motors met strong support at 12. for a time, but it closed at 11 off ^1. Chrysler was heavily sold, and finished at 10’,2, off	Among the carrier shares. Union
Pacific and Atchison were heavy, the former losing more than 2 points and the latter more than a point.
“Repeal” stocks were strong early, but they faded fast in the late trading. Crown Cork & Seal, which touched 19 during the day, closed at 17"hI National Distillers finished at 20’i, against the day's top of 22 *i, and Owens Illinois Glass dropped to 35’~. compared with the day’s high of 37^.
The London market was irregular, but British funds moved higher. In Paris, prices on the Bourse were firm.
so large a proportion of assents to its refunding plan is a distinct achievement. The Nickel Plate has been hard at it, since mid-September, in an attempt to obtain the assent of holders of its $20,000,000 In unsecured notes to its refinann-ing proposal. The notes matured on October 1, and the Nickel Plate still has the assent of less than 90% of the noteholders to its proposal.
The next big carrier maturity which must be taken care of is that of the Iron Mountain bonds of the Missouri Pacific system due May 1. As yet, no plan for taking care of this has been promulgated. The Great Northern already has taken preliminary-steps to facilitate the meeting of the St. Paul. Minneapolis &. Manitoba issues which mature on July 1.
The railroads are distinctly hopeful that the Senate will put back in the Bankruptcy bill a clause permitting its use in railroad reorganizations. Railroads were omitted from the bill as passed by the House. The bill would greatly facilitate carrier reorganizations.
Gulf Coast Attracts Oil Men
Despite the uncertainties of the oil situation at present, there has been unusual activity in the Gulf Coastal area, where leases are being taken up. Oil companies are insuring themselves of future supplies, and in some quarters it is insisted there is bound to be a big drilling play in the area within the next year or two. A number of salt domes have been mapped, and quite a few proven.
Lease obligations compel, in many cases, the holder to drill or to surrender within a definite period. Recently, land-owners have taken a stand against leasing on a basis of delayed drilling obligations, which has meant early testing of properties.
England's Gold
In two months the Bank of England has been able to repair all the damage done to its gold holdings by the payment of the war debt instalment on December 15. The building up of the bank’s gold holdings, m so short a time, is a dramatic achievement, due directly to the operations of the Exchange Equalization Fund. Reduced to its simplest terms, the operation consisted in buying sterling during the fall, when it was depressed heavily by the necessity of England’s making the war debt payment and seasonal influences, and selling it on the rise, which has carried sterling up around 30 cents from the low point.

The American Can Report.
American Can was able to build up its cash resources last year largely through sale of inventories. Inventories at the end of 1932 were down to $14,568,788. off just about $7,200,000 from the close of 1931. The increase in the company’s cash amounted to roughly $6,700,000.
The deficit after dividends? of $1,825,028 looks large, but the company's depreciation write-offs was held at $2,000,000 last year, the same as in the three preceding years On an actual cash oittgo basis, the company's income statement was not discouraging.
Consolidated Ghm
The management of Consolidated Gas took a notable forward step in regard to publication of its annual report. In previous years the report has been released at the annual meeting, and newspapermen have been hard put to it to get an accurate presentation of the essentials of the statement before the public swiftly. This year the company followed the procedure taken by many companies in releasing advance copies of the report to the press. The 1932 report, in addition, was more complete than in prior years and represented a distinct advance in corporate publicity.
Two items m the statement stood out. One was the fact that the company, in 1932, had to spend $50,564,436 for gross capital outlay. While this was a drastic reduction from previous years, it is a large outlay to make in a period of declining business and revenues.
Bank loans, at the end of 1932. stood at $11,600,000. While that represented a sharp shrinkage from the close of 1931, when they stood at close to $60,000,000, bank loans in the last quarter of 1932 were up $5,600,000. Financing in the spring of 1932 practically wiped out the company’s bank loans, so that the figure of $11,600,000 shown for the yoar-end reflects bank debt accumulated during 1932.
Plan Opcratix »*
With a little more than 90% of its convertible	bonds deposited under the plan of
meeting the March 1 maturity, the Baltimore & Ohio declared the plan operative. It gave clear warning to the holdouts that they could expect nothing better than the terms accepted by depositing security holders of 50% In cash and 50% in a new obligation of the road. It is quite clear now that the non-assenters can come in under the plan or fight for the face amounts of their bonds in the courts.
The fact that the Baltimore & Ohio obtained
