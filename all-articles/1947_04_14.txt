Stocks were down 1 to 8 terday. The accumulate on of ing news, highlighted by labor disputes, and the gloomy picture painted for the business outlook by economists, started liquidation last week, which brought out heavy selling from all sources yesterday. The volume of 2.2 million shares was the largest since December 9, when 2,840,000 shares changed hands.
The decline xn the industrial average or 5.07 points to 166.69 was the widest break since November 6, 1946. The average was the lowest since November 25, 1946. The railroads, ending at 44.45, were the lowest since November 6. 1944. The utilities closed at 33.SI, the lowest since October 10, 1946.
The decline in the Dow-J ones industrial and railroad averages below the January and March bottoms invalidates any thought that the February advance might have signaled a major uptrend under the Dow Theory. That bull-market interpretation was advanced here, on a tentative basis, on February S. The latest action means that the bear market interpretation last September has not been reversed. It also means that the lows of last October. 163.12 for the industrial and 44.69 (broken yesterday by a small fraction) in the rails, are being tested again. If the lows are broken by the industrials. too, the bear trend will be reaffirmed. On the other hand, if the averages should stop here and later on rise through the highs reached in February—1S4.49 and 53.42 —a bull market would be signaled under the Dow Theory.

City Investing Co.—
Inauguration of dividend payments on the present common stock of City Investing Co. appears to reflect not only the improvement in earnings which already has taken place, but expectation of the management of further improvement. While the first declara- i tion was 30 cents a share, R. W. Dowling, president, has stated that ”if current earnings continue substantially at the present level, the company expects to pay regular quarterly dividends on the common stock at the rate of 15 cents a share, commencing August 15. 1947.” For the fiscal year which
ends with this month, net income of the company, it is estimated, will be between $600.000 and $700,000. Further improvement is expected next fiscal year, and, on the basis of present conditions and prospects, the management feels that net may reach somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 million. The company has outstanding 14.112 shares of 5»£% preferred stock and 960,000 shares of $5 par common stock.
