Broad Stock Sell-Off Signals Change in Market
Cyclical Issues
Take Command
By Svzanse McGee.
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The stock market's violent sell-off late Friday, even as the bond market managed to stage a muted rally, is starting to worry some traders and Investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 247.37 points, its second-largest point decline ever, capping a week In which some of the market's leading stocks and bellwether sectors took a beating. The 3.117' drop was the largest percentage loss In a single session since Nov. 15,1991.
The retreat spread to Tokyo early Monday, with the Nikkei stock average down
376.44	points to 18949.59 at 10 a.m. In Tokyo.
In the U.S. on Friday, stocks were buffeted first by the combination of a weaker dollar and rising Interest rates as bonds slumped. But while bonds retrieved all of their losses, traders said stock investors remained unnerved by recurring signs that some of the market's largest and most predictable companies, Including Gillette and Coca-Cola, might fall to deliver stable earnings growth in the future. Also clouding the horizon is the prospect that the strike at United Parcel Service of America will Increase wage pressures and hamper the ability of many companies to deliver stronger earnings by cutting costs.
At 7694.66, the industrials still ended the week up 19.337, for the year to date, a gain that Is nearly twice the long-term average annual stock market return of around 107,. But in just seven trading
Driving the Market
Until this month, weakness in one market leader usually was offset by strength in another. Chart shows daily value of selected Dow Jones industry groups; Dec. 31,1996=100
sessions since the Industrials hit a record high of 8259.31 on Aug. 6. the average has shed 6.847,.
"I don't think this is the beginning of any kind of crash, but it was an ugly, ugly day," says Michael Clark, head of block trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. And things could get uglier still, he believes.
"It's time for Investors to take a big dose of humility,” Mr. Clark says. "People are going to have to get their minds around the fact that you don't always buy every dip, and that markets always go up 207, a year."
Mr. Clark says the Dow Jones Industrials could "easily” fall to 7300.
Whal worries analysts and traders most about this retreat Is Its broad-based nature. On Friday, traders' screens were awash In red ink as 2,150 stocks fell on the New York Stock Exchange, while only 731 rose. Only six of the 90 Dow Jones Industry groups managed to eke out gains.
For months, the stock market's biggest and most Important sectors marched to different drummers. While technology and pharmaceuticals rose, banking or energy
fell. That so-called rotating leadership, characteristic of much of the past 2's years, acted as a relief valve, helping to prevent the overall market from falling more than 107, In any given downturn.
Now, suddenly, the leadership sectors are all moving In lock step. And they're heading in the wrong direction.
This month, all of the most Important sectors have come up against heavy selling pressure. The leadership role Is being assumed by volatile cyclical groups, such as mining companies and heavy-equipment manufacturers-hardly a comforting thought for the millions of Investors with money in the most popular growth stocks.
"The leadership that's brought the market up so much is made up of the groups that are correcting the most," says Richard Bernstein, a quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co.
To some, the most worrying part of the selling Is Investors' reluctance to rotate from one traditional market leader, such as drugs, Into another, such as technology. Instead, they are shifting their cash Into completely new sectors of the market, or Plnixe Dim to I’age Ci, Cblumit .1

Leading Stocks Lose Their Luster; Volatile Cyclicals Take Command

"What we'd seen this year until now is that each leading group would undergo its own little correction, with corresponding strength in other parts of the market," says Michael Driscoll, a block trader at Hambrecht & Quist.
During the technology sell-off last spring, for instance, Mr. Driscoll says Exxon and other large oil companies saw a flurry of buying that helped stock indexes recover from the 9.87, market slump in March and April. Today, he says, that pattern is broken: None of these groups seem to hold any appeal for investors.
The list of casualties is comprehensive. Coca-Cola and Gillette, once the monarchs of lhe blue-chip world, have tumbled 10.65'a and 4.67, respectively, since earnings worries surfaced at both companies.
The Dow Jones pharmaceutical group has slumped 7.37, since the beginning of the month, while the money-center bank group has fallen 3.87, and financial stocks as a group have declined 4.57,. Energy stocks have fallen from their highs, while many of lhe highflying technology companies are seeing signs of weakness.
Coming to the fore are Industry groups that have been out of favor for months, If not years. Gold mining, the only Dow Jones industry group to have posted a loss so far this year, has rallied sharply In recent weeks, and was the second-bestperforming group Friday. Copper-mining companies and aluminum refiners have seen their stock prices rise. Forest-products companies and the manufacturers of heavy equipment and agricultural equipment are reporting a revival of Investor Interest.
Even with the bond market In turmoil this past week and stock Investors perplexed by the market's recent gyrations, some strategists say they won't worry about the market's declines unless far more sectors start to decline than Io post gains. So far, that hasn't happened: For most of the year, according to data from Ned Davis Research, about half of the 100 market sectors It tracks have failed to post declines of 107, or more In the preceding 52 weeks. That's close to a new low.
Friday's Market Activity
Shares of several consumer-product names posted sharp declines In the session, with Procter & Gamble shedding 7’. to 130 9/16, Its lowest close In two months, while a host of drug and personalcare-products makers suffered further declines. The Morgan Stanley Index of consumer stocks, one popular measure of the group's performance, gave up 2.957,.
The group has shed some ground In recent sessions. Investors fear that an
expanding economy will limit the opportunities in this group, which typically doesn't benefit from economic expansion, and they worry about the effect that a weakening dollar might have on these multinationals' sales abroad. Those worries were exacerbated by some profit worries, after analysts lowered their earnings estimates for Gillette, at lhe company's direction. Shares of the stock dropped 4 3/16 to 85V
Coca-Cola, also the focus of earnings worries, fell 1 5/16 to 58*..
In addition to all the fundamental problems the market faced in the session, late trading was punctuated by a round of block selling related to the so-called double-witching expiration of certain stock and stock-index options.
Trading reached 534.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
While the weakness was glaringly apparent In the consumer-products names, a broad cross-section of Industries participated In lhe downturn.
Wall Street saw its own stocks fall with the market averages. Shares of Merrill Lynch dropped 3*< to 62, Lehman Brothers shed 1 9/16 to 42V Alex. Brown fell l'< to 82's, and Salomon declined l'« to 61 5/16.
Thanks to the recovery in the bond market, the decline In banking stocks was smaller than for the broad market. The Philadelphia Bank Index lost 1.817, for the session, compared with 2.597, for Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index, which dropped 23.96 to 900.81, Its lowest level since July 1.
