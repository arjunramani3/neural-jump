Stocks Rally as Super Tuesday Results Buoy

DJIA rose nearly 1,200 points; bond yields hover near record lows

U.S. stocks surged Wednesday as a strong Super Tuesday performance by former Vice
President Joe Biden and growing signs of a coordinated response to the coronavirus reassured
jittery investors.
Major indexes opened sharply higher and climbed steadily throughout the session. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 1,200 points, closing near session highs as all 30 stocks in
the index climbed.
Shares of health insurers led the march. UnitedHealth climbed 11% in the Dow, while Anthem
gained 16% and Humana rose 14%, moves some money managers dubbed the “Biden bump.”
The results from the Tuesday primaries suggested Mr. Biden could be a more formidable
opponent to Sen. Bernie Sanders than originally anticipated—a good sign for investors worried
that Mr. Sanders’s more progressive pledges wouldn’t be favorable for businesses. “I do believe
that if you had woken up this morning and Bernie Sanders was the presumptive nominee, the
markets would not be reacting as they are today,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment
strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co.
The rally provided some relief to equities markets, which had tumbled for seven consecutive
sessions through Friday, as coronavirus anxieties swelled. The blue-chip index climbed 1,173.45
points, or 4.5%, to 27090.86 Wednesday, while the S&P 500 gained 126.75 points, or 4.2%, to
3130.12. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 334 points, or 3.8%, to 9018.09,
returning to positive territory for the year. All three indexes are still off about 8% from their
February records.
Volatility in the stock market has roared back over the past two weeks—the S&P has logged
moves of at least 1% in seven of the past 10 trading sessions.

The jump in stocks helped to reverse the losses that markets suffered Tuesday after the Federal
Reserve announced its first emergency rate cut in more than a decade to stem the economic
fallout of the coronavirus.
By Wednesday, some anxieties appeared to ease. U.S. lawmakers reached an $8 billion deal to
combat the coronavirus. More than $3 billion is earmarked for developing treatments for the
disease; an additional $2.2 billion is allocated for preventing its spread.
“There’s a more coordinated global effort to fight the disease, with fiscal policy and allocations
of resources—financial and human,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and
derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “People are optimistic.”
Eleven people have died from the epidemic in the U.S., and globally, more than 93,000 people
have been infected. The virus has disrupted supply chains across Asia and Europe and
threatened future earnings at large multinationals.
In response, central banks and governments from across the globe have worked to reassure
residents and markets. After the Fed’s rate cut Tuesday, the Bank of Canada followed by
slashing its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point.
The S&P 500 health-care sector finished the day with its largest percentage gain since
November 2008, up 5.8%. Mr. Sanders’s proposal for Medicare for All has posed a potential
threat to health insurers.
“I think some of what was happening over the past two weeks, as Bernie Sanders gained in the
polls, was that the market was worried about what he may mean to the economy and the
markets moving forward if he were president,” Mr. Schutte of Northwestern Mutual said.
The S&P 500 was also boosted by utilities, which surged 5.7%, and consumer-staples sectors,
which rose 4.9%.
Meanwhile, Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist for LPL Financial, said strong economic
data propelled the day’s gains.
U.S. services-sector activity rose to 57.3 for February, the highest reading since a year before,
according to the Institute for Supply Management’s nonmanufacturing index. The report
provides a sense of business conditions for service providers, such as restaurants and bankers.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
“Two-thirds of the economy is [based on] services, and so far the coronavirus has not slowed
things down,” Mr. Detrick said. “It’s another sign that the U.S. economy is improving ahead of a

slowdown.”
Globally, stocks largely ticked up, too. The Stoxx Europe 600 closed higher for the third day in a
row, gaining 1.4%. The Shanghai Composite added 0.6%
Despite the gains in stocks, investors flocked into haven assets, with yields on government
bonds continuing to fall. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note dropped to 0.994% by the
end of the day, after falling below 1% for the first time in the previous session. Yields fall when
bond prices rise.
Mr. Schutte said the continued demand for bonds reflects a market that remains “defensive in
nature.”
“Investors are keeping one hand on the wall in case [the stock rally] is not for real,” he said.
Others remained more skeptical. Alex Au, managing director at Alphalex Capital Management,
a hedge fund based in Hong Kong, said it is hard to determine how much further markets might
sell off.
“I am just holding my cash, sitting on the sidelines and waiting for clearer signals,” Mr. Au said.
