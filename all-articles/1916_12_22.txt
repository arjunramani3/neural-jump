Sales, 1,779,700 shares.
AH. the bear ammunition seems to have been exhausted for the moment, and, in the absence c£ any further leakin gs from Washington of new and surprising developments in the international situation, prices took a turn*upward. The opening was strong, with gains running from 2 to 7 points, and subsequent trading developed further buying power. It seems to be established beyond the possibility of doubt that many speculative sources were in possession for some days in advance of knowledge of the diplomatic developments which came as a surprise to, the general publie, and that the market was played accordingly with great benefit to ineiders. That a large short interest still exists is indicated by a large private borrowing demand for securities, but is also true that a good part of the renewed strength came from short covering with a substantial amount of bargain buying, both from occasional investors and from those who recently sold their long stocks at top prices.	.
The Kaiser is to summon Ambassador Gerard to discuss possible American mediation and action. Dr. Andrew D. White, former ambassador to Germany says that the President is right, that all the talk about England crushing Germany is child’s talk, and that England must realize that it is.a drawn game. The gold shipments to this country are apparently financed by all the great powers. Russia is said to have released a large amount of its gold holdings. The Bank of England's gold reserves are lower and the Bank of France did lose $39,200,000 in gold last week.
The lack of freight cars is so intense in the Lake s region and the Northwest that there are general reports of a shutdown of factories and mills during the Christmas holidays to permit the roads to catch up.
*St.reng*tili jvt opening
Prices recovered with a snap at the opening, despite the wobbling at Washington, and during the first ten minutes of trading retained a level of from two to six points above the close in most of the heavy sufferers in Thursday’s slump. United States Steel opened 25,000 shares at 104 to 104 %. being up 3% the latter figure. During the 3oilowing ten minutes it sold as low as 103%.
Vigorous sliort covering:
Openinc* strength was well maintained throughout tlie firwt hulf hour and in many cases was followed by 1 further improvement. It was reported that many large operators who had been on the bear side had switched j their position and were now buying stocks. There was a . vigorous covering of shorts among the profescsional
•	traders and some investment buying from bargain hunters.
‘ Bip: t uroover
i Commission and investment houses reported good buy! ing by that clasn of .nvestors which cornea, into the market , only at long periods to pick up bargains. Many orders of [ this character were in hand on Thursday, but were with-( held from execution after the publication of Secretary j Lansing’s first interview. Some further liquidation was ■ in process where calls for additional margin had not been i met. There was some distribution by large interests.
•	which came to the support of the market at its weakest. , and now find themselves with profits in hand. It is Hie [ usual experience of tho market that a secondary reaction
follows such profit-taking, and. therefore, many brokers Lexpect to see precedent followed, although as a rule the I present market has proved a law unto itself.
' Bargain limiters busy
’ A steady upward trend developed throughout the sec; ond hour reaching its apex at the end of the period, coincident with publication of King George’s speech proroguing ; Parliament and expressing the view that there is no pros-poet of peace in sight. All the London papers express ' surprise at President Wilson’s peace proposal. Although they all give him credit for the best of intentions their implication is that the note was a blunder. American
Newspaper comment
The volume of trading was materially and the teading was like a calm after a.ftonn compared with Thursday's operations. There were no violent fiucte-ations in any quarter and no signs of any steess following the heavy liquidation. The panic* such as it was, was confined entirely to the stock and the commodity future ma-r-kets, all of which seem to be recovering successfully. It is assumed that there win be further liquidation followed by a churning process, but new'buying power is •making its appearance and in the absence of any more exciting news from Washington there should be a period of study of values and of business conditions, which have been entirely lost sight of in the past week.
A quiet, well behaved market
The market was peaceable and wdl "behaved during the early afternoon, with prices holding to a fairly steady level on a large though not extreme overturn, and with a. constant stream of buying orders at or below present market level. In commission houses, where advice has recently been to exert extreme caution, the tone became distinctly bullish, although the normal secondary reaction is looked for. It is felt, however, that the worst of the liquidation is passed, and that with renewed margins and. decreased bank commitments the general situation is excellent, and technically much stronger than in recent weeks. However, caution is urged by industrial leaders. Mr. Schwab expects a severe period of depression in this country, which may become acute thfee to five years after peace.
HigTh prices for the day
There were no signs in the late trading of any of the usual holiday adjustments pending the Christmas recess. On the contrary', prices were marked up confidently. Neither were there any signs that the purport of King George’s speech had leaked out in advance, us had other recent announcements. There was, therefore, no discrimination or opportunity for private judgment as to what he said. Top prices for the day •were general through the market. U. S. Steel sold to 107%, as against a low of 100 Mi Thursday- Baldwin Locomotive sold at 62, compared with a low of 52 on Thursday. Crucible was up over 7 points from the closing. Central Leather showed an advance of 8 points, Cuba Cane Sugar of 6 points and Utah of over 7 points. Republic Steel and U- S. Rubber ruled about 6 points higher.
Com Products preferred responded to the declaration of 5^ deferred payment and an increase in the regular rate fom 5*~7 to 7c7f by taking up all of the deferred payment to 113; while the common advanced over 2 to 22^». Anaconda made a gain of over 5 points, and in the rails Reading and Norfolk showed advances of 3% and S points each. Industrial Alcohol sold at 112, as compared with a low of 94% on Thursday.
Chesapeake & Ohio
There were rumors of a coming move in Chesapeake & Ohio which advanced 3 points from Thursday’s close. The short interest m this issue was said to be one of the largest in the Street and there were indications of increasing nervousness in that group. The advance m the market has been such as to make the question of margins quite as )»ertinent now to the .-borts as it was 24 hours ago to those long of stock. In the fiscal year ended last June. Chesapeake earned llr< on the stock and tlie prospects are that the road w ill do better this year. Tlie stock w.*s one of those which stoutly resisted the weakness of the first half of the week.
