THE STOCK MARKET
A SHARP RALLY

Whole list moves forward with largest. advances in the oils, motors anti some of the j steels—Pan-American	issues huoya.nt j
throughout the session on expectations of, extra dividend—Call money still 6 % —Crucible Steel up 10 points front Monday’s low. low.
Sales. S25 ?O0 shares.
The whole price list worked toward higher level.:. There was some, rather urgent short covering in the oils, motors and some of the steels. U. S. Steel common at its best price of the day was up nearly 4 points from the low of Monday. Crucible advanced 10 points from the previous day’s low; the motors all the way from 2 points to over 10 points; the Dohcny oil stocks from 6 points to over 10 points. The Wall Street Journal on Monday called attention to the fact that while U. S. Steel common that day was forced to a new low on the present decline it failed to promote any considerable liquidation in other parts of the list- Traders were quick to read this as an indication of an oversold condition in the general market and started to cover their stocks.
The interview with James B. Forgan, the Chicago banker, in which he was quoted as seeing a considerable improvement in the credit situation, was a constructive factor not to he overlooked. Local money conditions continued easy with call funds obtainable throughout the day at 6%. It is true that the time money market is still restricted to small offerings at 978, but as long as the call money rate stays be satisfied.

A Quiet Opening
was a quiet one with an excellent tone While Pan-Amcrican A’s opening sale the stock then Tan up to 98%. Mexican While Crucible 'Steel ... This latter figure, however, was 3% points above the low of Monday.	_
In the. motor group General Motors was up ’/» at 24 % and Studebaker up % at 61. The opening on the rails showed only fractional changes from the previous close.
James B. Forgan Sees Improvement in Credit Situation
One of Tuesday morning's Chicago newspapers prints the following interview with Jas. B. Forgan, who returned on Monday to Chicago after attending the bankers’ convention in Washington and a subsequent meeting with New York bankers. Mr. Forgan says: "The feeling among the New York bankers is that the credit strain has passed the peak in the East, and I believe it is passing here in the West. The Federal Reserve Board in considering the reduction of bank loans did not make any definite distinction between essential and nonessential loans and it did not order or ask bankers to reduce loans on any fixed percentage basis. The bankers who attended the conference agreed that credit inflation has not been reduced as is customary at this time of year and that there must be a reduction if the additional need for credit for new crop requirements is to be met. Otherwise a serious situation would be confronted. It was agreed the banks should decide for themselves how to limit their loans hut that this will depend considerably on the section of the country. It may well be that loans cannot be reduced in the agricultural districts. The banks must take care of their customers. For example the automobile industry in Detroit must be cared for. otherwise many people would be thrown out of work and the industry seriously crippled. But loaning money to people who want to buy ears is decidedly another matter. Thus it is incumbent on banks to exercise individual judgment in making loans.”
Prices Rally
Going into the second hour the entire industrial list gave a good account of itself, U. S. Steel making an early high at 91%, an advance of nearly 2 points over the low of Monday. Baldwin led the equipment shares, getting close to 111 before 11:30. But it was in the oils that the main trading centered with the Doheny stocks the leaders. During this period Pan-American got up to 99% against a low last week of 91; Mexican Petroleum 174. an advance of nearly 10 points over the recent low; while Pan-Amcrican B at 94% was up 61s points from the low of the previous session. Directors of Pan-Amcrican are scheduled to meet next week and the opinion prevails in sources close to the management that stockholders will receive some kind of an extra dividend. Advices from Mexico tend to confirm earlier forecasts that the revolutionary government would do exerything in its power to please American business interests. Another factor favoring an advance in these stocks was the publication of the April oil shipment figures by leading Mexican producers which compared very favorably with tho record shipments of March.	,
Associated Dry Goods Makes New Low
Associated Dry Goods made a new low on the present decline at 28. The record high of 67% was made early this year. Much of this decline of nearly 40 points has been due to scattered selling by froightened holders who professed to see the profits of the dry goods companies wiped out by the price cutting sales now going on throughout the country. Dry Goods is now on a $4 dividend basis and interests controlling bhe company's affairs arc confident that this rate can be maintained.
Demand for Funds Continues Light
The demand for funds on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange continues light. The easiness of the Wall Street money situation is emphasized by the fact that only about 815,000,000 to $20,000,000 is being turned over daily in the call money market. At the close of each day’s trading many millions of dollars are left un-'loancd. Several months ago, when the stock market was more active,, the daily turnover of call money amounted to from $35,000,000 to $40,000,000, and as high as $45,000.000 on some big days. Another factor pointing to the liquidation is that banks are offering some time money at 9%, but .the easier call money rate has prompted borrowers to finance commitments in the latter market.
ment, given considerable publicity, that an organization controlling 85% of the fruit preserving business of the country had decided on a sugar boycott. These short sellers failed to pay any attention to the fact that the association controls only 3% of the sugar consumption of the United States. Punta AlegTe was sold down that day close to 9S and Cuban-American Sugar to around 55. When covering operations were started on the firmness in other parts of the list Punta Alegre quickly ran up to 106%, while Cuban-American got above 59. This latter is the equivalent of better than 590 for the old shares.
Motor Shares Move Up
The covering movement spread to the automobile shares in the early afternoon, and Studebaker, at 64, was up 5 points from the low of Monday. This is one group in which the so-called Waldorf crowd has reaped a golden harvest on the short side. These traders started selling Studebaker long before the stock dividend came off, but from the way ihe shares acted yesterday appear to have rather overdone the selling. It is true that the motor companies will submit rather unsatisfactory earnings statements for the current quarter, but this is due to the tie-up of freight throughout the country, rather than to any slackening in the demand for automobiles. A large percentage of the cars turned out of the Detroit factories arc still on the sidings in and about that city, although some have been driven overland to their destinations. .
Activity Develops in Copper Shares
The activity that developed about the same time in the copper shares was due to the belated realization that most of the big producers gave a good account of themselves and earned their dividends in the first quarter of Production costs arc coming down and it is cx,	■ his Summer will assume
It is no secret that insiders have been Pasco,
