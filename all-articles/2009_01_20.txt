Setting the tone was news that asset manager State Street is sitting on unrealized losses in its investment portfolio, as well as the U.K. government's announcement of expansion of its financial-rescue plan amid continued losses at British banks.

It was the Dow's worst Inauguration Day performance in its 113-year history.
Stocks fell to their lowest level in two months as fears about the banking system overpowered President Barack Obama's speech about hope.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 332.13 points, or 4%, at 7949.09, the lowest close since Nov. 20, 2008. Financials led the decline, as Bank of America slid nearly 29%, J.P. Morgan Chase tumbled 21% and Citigroup was off 20%.
The dollar rose to its highest level against the euro since Dec. 5. Oil rose 6.1% to $38.74 a barrel, the biggest percentage gain this year.
Setting the tone was news that asset manager State Street is sitting on unrealized losses in its investment portfolio, as well as the U.K. government's announcement of expansion of its financial-rescue plan amid continued losses at British banks.
Kevin Kruszenski, director of equity trading at KeyBanc, called State Street's announcement a "blockbuster. . . . People had been seeing State Street a little differently, as a little safer," he said.
New York-listed shares of Royal Bank of Scotland, which forecast a 2008 loss of up to $40.5 billion, fell 69%. Barclays was down 42.6%. HSBC Holdings declined 15.3%.
Just before noon Eastern time, a crowd gathered outside the New York Stock Exchange to watch the inaugural address on a large screen. On the exchange floor, traders clustered around smaller screens. Some simultaneously executed trades on handheld devices.
Stocks at first pared some losses during the address, but fell again as the speech proceeded and continued to slide in the afternoon. "There is so much pressure from financials," said Warren Meyers, managing partner at W.J. Dowd Inc. "There's too much negative financial news."
As its financial sector tumbled 16%, the broad S&P 500 index fell 5.3% to 805.22. Consumer discretionaries, materials and technology were all off more than 4%.
