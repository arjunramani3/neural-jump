Interest on the constructive side of the market was revived by a number of favorable news developments yesterday, and stocks staged a dynamic rally, with trading volume raised to roughly 1.600.000 shares, against 1,300.000 Wednesday. The rally was most pronounced in the final 50 minutes of trading, when stocks spurted ahead rapidly. Volume in the last 5C minutes reached 700,000 shares.
The bond market did better, with railroad obligations staging some good gains. Wall Street got a good deal of comfort from the action of the commodities markets. Wheat closed up almost 1 cent a bushel, and cotton advanced $1.50 a bale. In view’ of the government’s estimate of the year’s outturn Wednesday, cotton’s action was regarded as impressive.
The good news came with a rush at around midday. Union Pacific directors declared a quarterly payment of $1.50 a share on the common, the same as for the previous quarter. National Dairy Products directors voted the regular quarterly payment. The Steel tonnage report showed that the corporation's backlog at the end of October was 11,950 tons larger than at the close of September. One of the weekly food price indices recorded a definite improvement, which cancelled the previous week’s loss.
Although stocks by noon w*ere up above ■Wednesday’s closing prices, the real move in the market did not reach its full velocity until the last hour, when the effect of the favoring news was fully reflected.
“Beer” Stocks Celebrate
Overnight changes in prices were slight Some of the pivotal industrial stocks were fractionally lower, but they made up their losses m the first half hour of trading Telephone sold as low as 102**; American Can was at 51 and Westinghouse started at 24 Telephone closed at 107**, up 5 from the low and 4-K on the dav. Can was up 3l~, and Westinghouse 2%.
The ’’beer” stocks continued to celebrate the overwhelming political victory of the wot forces Owen-TUmois Glass closed at 40 up 39h, but it sold as high as 42%. U. S. Industrial Alcohol, at 30. was up l’-s? Mack Trucks scored a good gain, and Liquid Carbonic and Crown Cork & Seal were in demand.
Rails were firm. Union Pacific leading the way and closing at 70. up 41^. Montgomery’ Ward, Scars-Roebuck. and Case were helped by the betterment in wheat prices. The utilities were strong, aided by the lower percentage decline recorded in the electric output figures for the latest week.
Homestake covered a wide range. The stock opened at 118, ran up to 159, and then dropped to close at ISO *2, up a half.
The London market was irregular, British bonds were lower. In Paris, the bourse was heavy.
The Central Loadings
‘Central's loadings report, in railroad circles attracted immediate interest Loadings over the road’s own lines were ahead of the previous week. In 1931, the figures showed a sharp downward movement, own loadings of the road for the November 5 week falling 2,500 cars under those of the week ended October 29.
Receipts from connections were down just short of 1.000 cars from the previous week, while m the November 5 week last year they were off more than 1,600 cars from the previous week.
Total cars handled by the road in the November 5 week were down only 13.7% from the similar week of 1931. In the October 29 week, they were off 167? from the like 1931 week.
The favorable inferences drawn from the Central’s report were offset by the Pennsylvania’s statement, which showed a marked shrinkage in traffic from the previous week and a heavier percentage decline from the like 1931 week.
All signs indicate thnt the roads which recently have made the best showing ar the soft coal carriers dumping coal at Lake Erie ports. In the week ended November 7, coal dumpings into Great Lakes vessels set a new high record for the year to date. There has been a perceptible tapering off this week. Reports of the bituminous coal carriers, like Norfolk & Western, Chesapeake & Ohio and Virginian for October should be exceptionally good. The Chesapeake & Ohio report should make Its appearance within a week.
Post-Election Markets
The decline which took place in Wednesday’s trading was the second time in the past 36 years that the post-election trading session has been accompanied by drooping stock prices. In November, 1916, following the re-election of President Wilson, stocks slid off the day after election. The Dow-Jones industrial and rail averages both closed fractionally lower on the day. In 1920, there was a bull market in rails following the Harding victory, but the industrial average closed off in the post-olection trading session. In the seven other trading days following national elections, the markets have moved sharply ahead.
Farmers* Troubles
Farmers’ troubles were reflected in the Federal Land banks report for the third quarter. Delinquent and extended instalments were up more than 18% for the period, and real estate owned outright by the banks, or under optional sales contracts, advanced about 8%. Delinquencies and foreclosures of the Joint Stock Land banks during the quarter also followed an ascending curve.
The figures show that the process of scaling down obligations is continuing. It is r difficult process, particularly when both the Joint Stock Land banks and the Federal Land banks have securities outstanding on which interest must
be met. But the farmers, without a rise in commodity prices, cannot meet interest on obligations incurred when the commodity level was far above its present point.
Barley and Beer "
After a long absence from trading, barley reappeared in Chicago, with the December future selling at 291* cents a bushel. In other grain trading centers, including Winnipeg, there was a revived interest in the grain, at higher prices. Beer talk, of course, generated the new interest in barley.
Good News
The market was treated to a number of
favorable developments yesterday, and its response was immediate. The quickest reaction came after the announcement that unfilled tonnage of the Steel Corp., at the end of October, was up 11,950 tons from the end of September. Just before the statement was issued. Steel common sold at 35aZ2- Within two minutes afterwards, it was at 36 running up swiftly.
Earlier in the day, the market had shown it favored the upside. Telephone, for instance, ran from 103% to 105 in a few sales when the rest of the market was no better than firm.
