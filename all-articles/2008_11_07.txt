Stocks brushed aside a grim employment report and more bad news about the auto industry to recover some of their losses over the previous two days.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 248.02 points Friday, or 2.85%, to 8943.81. But losses Wednesday and Thursday left blue-chip average down 4.09% for the week.
On Friday, employment data for October showed a larger-than-expected decline in nonfarm payrolls, the 10th-straight monthly drop, and an increase in the unemployment rate to 6.5%. Many traders expected worse, which was reflected in the earlier declines and left room for gains once the report was released.
Although 28 of the 30 Dow components rose, General Motors fell more than 9% after it reported a bigger-than-expected third-quarter loss and said its cash levels will probably fall well below what is needed early next year.
Investors remain concerned that the economy's underlying problems will linger well into 2009. Daily trading volume during the past week has been lighter than the average in October, indicating that some investors remain uncertain about the direction of the market.
"It will take until January or February, at least, before we have a clearer picture of where the economy is headed," said Don Bright, a partner at Bright Trading in Chicago.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.9% Friday to 930.74, down 3.9% on the week. Both the Dow and the S&P lost a combined 10% on Wednesday and Thursday after an Election Day rally Tuesday.
More than twice as many New York Stock Exchange-listed shares rose than fell Friday. As investors moved into stocks, Treasury prices fell, sending yields higher.
The Dow trimmed early gains Friday during President-elect Barack Obama's news conference focusing on economic issues, in which he urged passage of a fiscal stimulus package. But it recovered almost all of them by the closing bell.
Crude-oil prices, meanwhile, rose 0.4% Friday to $61.04 a barrel, but ended the week down 10% in New York trading, which was dominated by concerns that demand will be weaker than expected due to softness in the global economy. Exxon Mobil gained 6.3%, and Chevron rose 4.8%.
