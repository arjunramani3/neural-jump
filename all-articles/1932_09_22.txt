Changes	figure*! from	previous closing		average.	
The spirited advance in stock prices of Wednesday was extended in the forepart of yesterday’s session, but heavy profit-taking and selling, Induced by unexpected news which was Interpreted as adverse, brought about a late reaction in stock prices, with pivotal issues off anywhere from a fraction to two or 'three points at the close. Speculative railroad 'bonds dropped rainy sharply, and the sag in the bond market made itself felt in stocks. Wheat lost more than a cent a bushel, but cotton closed about unchanged. At one time, cotton was up more than 51 a bale.
Trading was extremely heavy at the start of the day, with stocks strong. Big blocks of pivotal rail stocks changed hands at higher quotations at the opening. The industrial group, as a whole, was not as firm as the rails. United States Steel common, for instance, opened off fractionally. Utilities were generally firm, although there were a few mild setbacks.
After a brief period of hesitancy, stocks surged forward. American Telephone ran up to a new high on the move, around 117; Chesapeake & Ohio, Baltimore & Ohio, New York Central and Atchison all were strong, and the general list'displayed buoyancy.
Announcement by the Reconstruction Finance Corp, that the large loan to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, to take care of its March 1, 1933, maturity, would not be imm.-diately forthcoming, had a dampening- a freer on the second-grade rail bond market. The Baltimore & Ohio had planned to use some of the funds to anticipate the maturity. Baltimore & Ohio Issues sold off rapidly, and there were sharp declines elsewhere in the bond list. The reaction spread to stocks. The Interstate Commerce Commission has approved the Baltimore & Ohio loan, and in many quarters it had been anticipated that it would be made shortly.
Stocks steadied around the early afternoon lows, and staged some recovery in the final half hour. Volume of trading was at low levels compared with the activity which prevailed during the morning. Transactions for the day reached 3,700,000 shares, against 4,300,000 shares Wednesday.
Markets abroad were higher. In London, only the oils, as a group, lagged behind the generally rising market. In Faris, stocks were higher, trading activity only moderate.
The day's news included better figures on cigarette consumption, which brought some buying into the tobacco shares. American Tobacco B, for instance, closed the day unchanged, despite the weakness elsewhere. Omission of the National Distillers Products’ common dividend brought heavy selling intn that issue. A cut in gasoline prices by Standard Oil of New Jersey had an adverse effect on the oil issues.
New York Central's loadings, for the week ended September 17, were down only 21.4% from the similar week of 1931, In the preceding seven days, the road's loadings were off 27.6% from the like period of the previous year.
in August from the similar 1931 month than in the previous month. One interesting thing about the cigar output figures was that consumption'of the 5-cent cigar formed so large a proportion of the month's total. It reached 83.3% in August, the highest percentage on record. .In August. 1931. it was only 72.9% of the total. Quite obviously, the cigar smokers have ■changed their tastes to meet the changed economic conditions.
Incidentally, the two largest factors in the 5-cent' cigar field are General Cigar Co. and American Cigar Co. The latter is leased by American Tobacco.
Gasoline Price Cut
The reduction in the price of gasoline made by the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey brings the price of the refined product more in line with the price structure in the Southwest. The reduction also reflect the comparatively less favorable statistical position of the industry.
The period of lessened consumption of oil and gasoline is at hand. This Is bound to necessitate a reduction in crude oil production, or else a revision in the price structure.	*
National Distillers Omits Dividend
Omission of the quarterly dividend on National Distillers Products common brought about a sharp dip in the price of the stock. It sold off almost immediately to below 20, down 6 points from the preceding close. The stock has been quite active recently and a good deal of attention was drawn to the company not long ago when it declared a "dividend” in warehouse receipts for whisky.. The receipts, under the company’s proposal, are to be delivered to stockholders on October 1, 1934. Stockholders now are hoping that they won’t have to wait that long for resumption of cash dividends.

Movie Companies Entering Best Season
The dull summer season, and last summer was just about the dullest on record, is behind the motion picture industry, and it now is entering the best period of the year, when pick up on a seasonal basis. Theatre closings last summer were the largest on record. While the motion picture companies are not too sanguine on the outlook, they are distinctly hopeful that the coming months will record a fairly sharp pick-up over those just behind.
Every movie company has suffered during the depression, and threats of receiverships have been imminent against several. However, they have managed to survive until the present. Among the major units of the industry, Loew’s still Is reporting profits. For the 40 weeks to June 3, net income was equal to $4.37 a share on the 1.464,20S common shares, after preferred dividends. The showing compared with net of $6.04 a share on the common in the 40 weeks to June 5, 1931.
Warner Bros., Fox and Paramount all have shown heavy losses so far this year. For the quarter ended April 2, Paramount had a loss of $2,450,911 after interest, depreciation and reserves. The loss for the July 2 quarter is estimated at $5,900,000, with the total charges against earned surplus for the period, including special write-offs, put at $7,690,000. For the 39 weeks to May 8 the loss of Warner Bros, was more than $8,000,000, and Fox, for the 26 weeks to June 25, had a loss of $4,015,468, and a charge against surplus, including special items, of around $4,700,000. These losses, in most cases, have not entailed corresponding losses in cash, for they include heavy depreciation write-offs.
All movie companies have made drastic operating economies. They have cut salaries sharpiy and reduced their production costs per picture heavily. A return in earning power would be reflected dynamically in net. Such a comeback in earnings depends, of course, on increased attendance. The statement of Nicholas Schenck yesterday, citing the recent stability in attendance figures, with some slight gains, was distinctly interesting.
Cigarette Use Decline Halted
Monthly cigarette consumption figures recently have been poor reading, but those for August were a different story. For the first time in 15 months, consumption exceeded the corresponding month in the preceding year. The upturn over August, 1981, was 0.4 of 1%. The August consumption figure reduaed the cumulative decline from a year ago 10.87% for the eight months, against 12.41% for the first seven months.
Cigar consumption recorded a smaller drop
