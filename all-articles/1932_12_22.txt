A flood of selling in railroad stocks carried the general market to new lows on the reaction yesterday. The concentrated drive on the rail stocks was accompanied by a volley of rumors In regard to nearby carrier receiverships. A statement from the Kailroad Credit Corp., insisting that January 1 Interest payments would be met, brought only momentary relief from the pressure. In the late trading, the rail stocks were soft, and the market as a whole, closed near the day’s lows. Losses in active stocks ran to nearly 4 points.
The bond market went through another bad day. First and second-grade railroad obiiga-tions were forced downward all along the line. United States Government and Treasury issues were strong. Foreign Government obligations reacted.
Wheat and cotton both were down. Wheat closed off about T. cent a bushel, and the finis** found cotton about $1 a bale lower.
A number of factors contributed to the weakness in the rails. There was some disappointment over the conclusion of the wage parley at Chicago, continuing the 10% cut for nine months. Hopes had been held out that the railroads would succeed in their efforts to get a larger reduction in wages, and some disappointed selling came into the rail list on the announcement.
Most junior carrier bonds, at present prices, amply discount any scaling down which would take place in the event of receivership. Recent heavy offerings of these bonds have been due, in substantial part, to selling to establish tax losses. In addition, the Central of Georgia receivership brought home to many carrier bondholders the fact that despite the efforts of the various credit agencies, railroad defaults do occur. However, it certainly has been quite obvious for months that receiverships for quite a number of roads were only a matter of time and how long the R. F. C. and the R. R. C. would be willing to carry them along.
Governor Roosevelt and President Hoover, concerning war debts, added little to the sum of knowledge on the matter, but gave additional proof that there would be nothing in the way of definite action on revision until after March 4. Passage of the beer bill by Congress stirred no enthusiasm.
Markets abroad were higher. The upward trend in London was-*cxtcnded. with British funds steady. Sterling reacted, closing at $3.32 In Paris, the Bourse was stronger.
The lower stock market brought an advance in trading volume. Transactions on the “big board’’ ran to 1,300.000 shares, against Wednesday's total of 730,000.
helped the market for several rail stocks. Atchison is one, in particular, which will suffer again if the winter wheat crop is low. The government estimated winter wheat production for 1933 at under 400,000,000 bushels, against the 1932 outturn of 462,000,000 bushels. Trade estimate* figure that the government’s estimate of the crop to be harvested in June Is about a minimum figure.
Several roads, particularly the Atchison, the Burlington and tbe Missouri Pacific, were heavy sufferers because of the past season’s short winter wheat crop. Not only did they experience a heavy falling off in grain traffic, but, in addition. freight movement from cities to urban areas was cut down because of the reduced buying power of the farmers.
The government’s winter wheat forecast Indicates another slow period for these carriers, particularly for those with large mileage in Kansas Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado, where the bulk of the hard winter wheat acreage is concentrated. The present dreary outlook would be revised, of course, with improvement in the crop as the season progresses, or if the government should embark on a definite program designed to raise farm prices.
Mr. Wiggin
Now that Albert H. Wiggin is retiring from his post as chairman of the Chase National Bank, it is fitting to recall his extreme activity in dealing with American financial and credit problems during the critical period whch began in the last week of October, 1929. When the debacle came, the Chase was In a highly liquid condition, with loans at the money post down to only $1,000,000. In the week that followed, the Chase expanded its loans by $373,000,000 as frightened outside lenders were calling their Stock Exchange loans. This was about 29% of the total expansion of bank loans in New York City during the panic week, and 26% of the reported loan expansion for the whole country. It was a factor of first importance in arresting demoralization.
The Chase was one of the six banks which participated in the bankers’ pool organized to steady the stock market in that panic week____a
pool which completed liquidating its position in the early part of 1930.
Mr. Wiggin took an active part in the organization of the National Credit Corp, in the autumn of 1931. which assisted weak banks through the winter of 1931-1932. He became a member of the American Securities Investing Corp., formed early in June. 1932. a member of the banking and industrial committee formed in May, 1932. b.v Governor Harrison of the New York Federal Reserve Board, and has participated a number of times in conference of business men and bankers called by President Hoover.	v

The Alleghany Bond Suit
The suit now m the courts, socking to hold investment houses which disposed of three issues of Alleghany Corp, collateral trust bonds liable for the full amount of the bonds sold in 1929 and 1930 is one of the most interesting which has come up m a long time. It turns on allegations of false representations by the selling houses in the circulars issued in connection with the sale of the bonds.
The question at issue is extremely technical, but resolves Itself into one of interpretation of two paragraphs of the circular covering what the Indenture of the bonds would provide, and whether the indenture accorded with the statements made in the circular. Taken from its context, and standing by itself, the clause in the circular covering maintenance of collateral under the bonds indicates one thing. If considered in conjunction with the provisions of the indenture, it is subject to a totally different interpretation.
One of the interesting things about this case is that the circulars of the original issuing houses did not include the “saving sentence’’ which reads: “The above statements, while not guaranteed, are taken from sources which we believe to be reliable.’’
The case, now in the hands of Supreme Court Justice Walsh, undoubtedly will set a precedent on the whole question of bond circulars.
Bank of England Statement
The statement of the Bank of England reflected the consummation of the war debt payment to the United States, but all phases of the payment did not show up. The bank’s bullion reserves were cut by £19,677,000. The shrinkage in reserves was not so large, as circulation in the week ended December 22 was down a little more than £2,000,000 from the previous week.
The bank’s holdings of government securities went up about £25,400,000. This increase did not entirely reflect the shifting about of governments as result of the war debt payments. The bank actually received roughly £29,000,000 in governments in connection with the war debt payments. Since it carries all its Items at par of exchange, only roughly £19,600,000 of these governments are included in the bank statement. The remainder involved in the debt transaction was turned over to the Exchange Equalization Fund.
The proportion of the bank's reserves to 11a-bilitieuLfell to 18.1%, the lowest level since December 31, 1925, which coincided with the lapse of the Gold and Silver Control Act of 1920. Bullion holdings were back to £120,628,boo, a little under the total for the corresponding week of 1931. The debt payment nullified England’s efforts to build up her gold resources in an attempt to win her way back to the gold standard.
