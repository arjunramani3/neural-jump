"Putting a time frame on it makes the plan seem more realistic and definitely puts their credibility on the line," said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management. "When pessimism gets very extreme, you get these sorts of relief rallies, but until you resolve some of the fundamental issues, it's hard to get a runaway rally," said Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein.

Stocks soared as investors put their faith in a resolution to Europe's debt crisis and the ability of U.S. companies to power through an uncertain economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 330.06 points, or almost 3%, to 11433.18, its biggest one-day surge in two months. The gains add to a powerful rally that began in the final hour of trading Tuesday last week and has pushed the Dow up more than 1000 points in less than five days.
Monday's gains came after German and French leaders said they were determined to present a "comprehensive package" by the end of October that would include a plan to recapitalize euro-zone banks as needed and address the Continent's debt crisis. Europe's stock markets soared. Germany's DAX index gained 3%, while France's CAC-40 popped 2.1%.
"Putting a time frame on it makes the plan seem more realistic and definitely puts their credibility on the line," said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management.
Still, the package outlined by the two leaders was sparse, suggesting Europe's two top economies have yet to agree on the plan's specific elements. And for investors who have been growing increasingly skeptical of European officials' ability to contain the crisis, the recent commitments rang hollow.
"I'd be leery of this move," said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group. "I don't think there are a lot of strong underpinnings to this rally."
One sign Monday's rally lacked strength: Volume was particularly low as holidays were being observed in the U.S., Canada and Japan. (Bond markets in the U.S. also were closed.) Some 3.9 billion shares changed hands in New York Stock Exchange composite volume, below the daily average of 4.4 billion shares this year and the lowest in three weeks.
Traders have noted that many of the big gains have been on days of lighter volume, suggesting less conviction on the part of investors.
The recent rally has sparked debate among both stock-chart watchers and fundamentals analysts about whether stocks may finally be breaking out of their so-called trading range. The Dow has been bouncing roughly between 10500 and 11500 for the past two months.
Some technical analysts believe the Dow's surge last week was a sign stocks had hit bottom, for this period at least. Others point to the tough macroeconomic outlook--the U.S. economy is still struggling, and many issues remain unresolved in Europe.
"When pessimism gets very extreme, you get these sorts of relief rallies, but until you resolve some of the fundamental issues, it's hard to get a runaway rally," said Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein. "I wouldn't call this a true inflection point."
The volatility has also alarmed investors, keeping many at bay. Monday's move, for example, was the 10th time in the past 11 trading sessions that the Dow moved by more than 100 points.
Many investors are now looking to the coming earnings season for clues. Alcoa is the first Dow component to report third-quarter earnings, on Tuesday.
In a reflection of growing cautiousness, company analysts have reined in their expectations for corporate profits in the quarter, and in the past week alone have brought them down by a further 6.2% for the Standard & Poor's 500 companies, according to S&P Capital IQ.
But some investors say they think companies can defy the economic weakness, especially since relatively few companies have issued negative prereleases--effectively, warnings that earnings may be weaker than forecast.
"A lot of us were bracing for a worse prerelease season than we've actually seen," Mr. Zlotnikov said.
Monday's gains were concentrated among some of the stocks that were most battered during the summer, with the beleaguered financial sector surging higher, led by Morgan Stanley, up $1.05, or 7.4%, to $15.29, and Bank of America, which added 38 cents, or 6.4%, to 6.28. Energy, materials and industrial stocks were close behind.
The euro, which has tumbled amid the European concerns, rose 2% to $1.3644.
The falling greenback lit a fire under dollar-priced commodities.
