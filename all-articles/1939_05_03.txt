C.	OF C. MEETING—
Nation’s industry—delegates to the 27th annual convention of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce—last night took their fight against “restrictive" governmental regulations directly to individual Congressmen. Drastic revision of the Wagner Act and government spending were urged in personal pleas at 26 dinners held simultaneously throughout the Capital.
Yesterday's session included a prediction by President King of Iowa-Nebraska Light & Power? that the utilities are prepared to spend $1,006,000,000 annually for the next three years on capital expenditures if the government halts its present restrictions. Chairman Phillips of Phillips Petroleum demanded enactment of “authoritative" control of conservation in the oil industry. Delegates vigorously applauded the mention by Senator Burke of Vice President Gamer as "one of the greatest men of this age." The Senator was likewise applauded when he predicted a “50-50" chance that Congress will amend the Wagner .Labor Act.	'
