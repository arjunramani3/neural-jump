THE MARKET.
" 10.—Being a holiday in London there/were no slock exchange quotations, and the. news elsewhere /was of small interest. The South African war posi-lion was unchanged so far as cable advices were /concerned. - The European outlook was peaceful. Money in the open discount market showed some signs of casing off and an inflow to London from /the; Provinces was expected to relieve pressure. -Foreign houses did not anticipate that speculative orders from the other side would be of sufficient importance to affect the market either way.
10.30.—The sentiment at the opening seemed very bullish and all the railroad stocks showed ad; vances. There was quite large trading in Union I’a-- cific common and Missouri Pacific at an advance. The higher priced railroads were strong, the buying < of Pennsylvania being especially good.
Louisville was a little heavy although the reduc-' lion in price was small on the plan for exchanging the Nashville & Chattanooga stock. In spite of talk of labor troubles. Southern Railroad preferred was well bought. There was sanguine dividend talk on Missouri Pacific. Industrials were fi'^o. American Tobacco rapidly recovering half its <livi dend. Sugar was weak, however, and the selling was considered good. ■
11.15.—Some significant selling of the preferred stocks of the steel companies notably Federal Steel, frightened holders of the common stocks and encouraged traders to hammer the market. It was accompanied by rumors of the shutting down of steel mills at Joliet. Sugar was heavy and it was noticeable that quite a little preferred stock was coming out. The railroad market sympathized with the weakness in industrials and traders sold all round but strength was displayed in spots notably in the Grangers. Pacific Mail was weak on an anticipated bad statement for Februarv.	.

3 p. m.—On the confirmation of the reported shutting down of mills the selling of steel stocks continued, Federal Steel being especially weak. La support was forthcoming from the supposed inside interests here and Chicago was considered to be a large. seller. The bull account in B. R. T. seemed a weak one and the stock readily gave way trnder at tacks from traders. The other tractions and Sugar held well but the railroad list was heavy and a good deal of profit taking by the various bail pools was suspected. The coalers continued to show fair strength and the buying of Norfolk on any recession was considered of a good character.
Sales of stocks from 2 to 3 p. ni., 205,780 shares. Total sales to 3 p. m., 891,809 shares.
3.30 [i. in.—There w:js the usual scarcity of Third .1 venue in the loan crowd, stock being in demand flat. There was some demand for B. & O. common, Missouri Pacific, Sugar and T. C. & L at 3>' while the rest of 1 lie list carried over at 3 to 3A'f. There was sonic curiosity to see whether the steel stocks had been oversold. Although a good deal was borrowed there seemed to be plenty forthcoming. Anuiisou preferred was rather in demand, below the normal rate. It was reported that Missouri Pacific was going to take over Texas & Pacific ou ■i basis of-three shares of the hitter to one of the former.
Tiie only support in the steel stocks seemed to tome from bear traders taking profits and there .was a general belief that the inside Chicago following had got out at higher levels. Missouri Pacific .was conspicuously strong on a renewal of buying I’rom the same quarters as during last week. Bur-i-ington was weak and the general feeling was that Ids extension to Ogden to compete with the transcontinental lilies was a mistake. ' Sugar showed a little strength _on renewal of support from the /iZZ/'Z ’hulLii/jFcsts in 1iie stock and a relatively 'small amount of buying gave strength to Third 'Avenue. AViili these exceptions the tone was heavy.

1.20.—A cessation of selling from the AA'est. checked the decline in the Steel stocks, and there was a harder tom- observable on the covering of room traders, and some local buying. Ahi. Pacific continued -very strong and there was a notable advance in M.. K. it T. pfd. accompanied by reports that llu? buying of Missouri Pacific, was with a view to closer relations between the two roads Sugar continued to come out on any recovery, ami room traders sold.

2.20 p. in.—After showing some tendency to rally the steel stocks broke again, led by Tennessee Goal & Iron. Various more or less official state-Thants as to overproduction and the necessity for reducing Hie output, and .very heavy selling "both for the. inside and from Chicago were given as the reasons. The whole market suffered, and in tlie absence of further pool buying, Missouri Pacific had a/considerable reaction. Chicago was also a seller 'of People's Gas and most, of the steel preferred Lstock!wns said to be coining from there, Tlie Ta-cific stocks iiad fair support at the lower figures.
