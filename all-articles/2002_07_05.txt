For all the drama last week, the markets ended relatively flat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.47% on the week, or 136.24 points, to 9379.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.01%, or 14.85, to 1448.36, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost a bare 0.08% to 989.03.
That is despite impressive gains Friday, which saw a surge of buying in a holiday-shortened trading session that included the lightest volumes of the year. The Nasdaq soared 4.9%, its best gain since a 7.8% one-day gain two months ago, while the Dow average rose 3.6%, its best gain since September of last year. The Standard & Poor's jumped 3.7%.
Other active stocks Friday included Merck, which was in the news on several fronts. The company is the target of a shareholder lawsuit that alleges it made material misrepresentations about its finances between July 1, 1999 and June 21, 2002, thereby artificially inflating the price of Merck securities. Separately, Merck said preliminary data show its drug Zocor reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke. Shares gained 1.58, or 3.3%, to 48.86.

INVESTORS DON'T KNOW which stock market they should believe.
Is it the remarkable rally that investors saw Friday, when relief about the lack of terrorism over the July 4 holiday sent stocks on their biggest one-day surge in months?
Or is it the weeks of slow, painful losses that preceded it, and which early last week sent the Nasdaq and the S&P to their lowest levels in years?
There is some historical reason for short-term optimism, as stocks tend to bounce higher, sometimes violently, after long periods of heavy selling, as bargain hunters begin to emerge. But unfortunately for investors, that's not the most likely scenario, say some traders and analysts; they say a host of obstacles stand in the way of a sustained rally, including a recent surge of stock issuance, signs that some investors are pulling money out of the market, and stock prices that still are too rich.
For all the drama last week, the markets ended relatively flat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.47% on the week, or 136.24 points, to 9379.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.01%, or 14.85, to 1448.36, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost a bare 0.08% to 989.03.
That is despite impressive gains Friday, which saw a surge of buying in a holiday-shortened trading session that included the lightest volumes of the year. The Nasdaq soared 4.9%, its best gain since a 7.8% one-day gain two months ago, while the Dow average rose 3.6%, its best gain since September of last year. The Standard & Poor's jumped 3.7%.
Traders say the market was helped Friday by the fact that several days have passed without another corporate-accounting shenanigan. With the economy improving, optimists say accounting woes may not be able to hold the market back much longer, as long as there are no more skeletons in companies' closets.
At the same time, Friday produced evidence of what can happen when investors stop worrying about terrorism, and focus on the impressive recent performance of the
economy.
"A big part of the rally was that the fear factor is slightly allayed," says Tim Smalls, senior equity trader at SG Cowen. "We've taken terrorism somewhat out of the equation."
Certainly, stocks are looking more attractive compared with other assets lately. Bond yields have fallen far, with the 10-year Treasury now yielding 4.86%. Money- market funds sport puny returns, and many investors aren't comfortable plowing their money into real estate, especially after the recent spike in prices. While corporate bonds offer generous yields, they, too, have been tumbling lately, as investors there digest the same issues that have been weighing on stocks .
But all of that may not be enough to offset troubles still brewing for stocks. For one thing, investors pulled $11.8 billion out of stock mutual funds in June, the biggest such move since September of last year, according to estimates by AMG Data Services. Individual investors don't always get it right -- the September shift from stocks came just as many stocks were hitting their lows -- but if the trend continues it could force fund managers to become sellers.
At the same time, companies themselves are turning into stock sellers, desperate to raise cash but no longer willing to add to their already heavy debt loads. June saw $15.4 billion of add-on stock sales and initial public offerings, the third month in a row of sharply rising sales. While it is early, this month is on pace for almost $20 billion of new stock sales, a surge of supply that could hurt overall prices because it adds new equity inventory to the market just as foreign and domestic investors are losing their taste for stocks.
Most important, profits remain under pressure, despite the economy's recent solid showing. Many companies can't raise prices or cut costs to improve their profits, while executives in key technology and pharmaceutical businesses say they see no reason to expect customer demand to pick up soon.
"Parts of the stock market that were responsible for endless growth optimism have no ammunition to get us back," says Steven Wieting, a senior economist at Salomon Smith Barney.
If those sectors that are holding up the economy begin to falter, that would mean bigger trouble. Last week, shares of Tweeter Home Entertainment Group tumbled after telling investors that sales are slowing for the company's upscale products, like high-definition televisions.

"All it takes is for one company to come out with bad earnings or the SEC to open an investigation before we go down again," says Mr. Smalls. "This market has to prove
itself."
Better earnings, and signs of reform at the corporate level, are needed before investors jump back into the market, some say.
"People want to see that companies are making money, and honestly making money," says Carol Buchman, a financial planner in New York. Her clients have been "grateful to be coming out of the market" lately, despite Friday's huge gains.
Friday's Market Activity
The battered semiconductor sector was the best performer Friday, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rising 32.68 points, or 9%, to 395.89. Among large-cap names, Advanced Micro Devices recouped losses it suffered Wednesday after lowering its second-quarter revenue target for the second time in just over two weeks. The stock gained 91 cents, or 11%, to 9.34.
Micron Technology rose 1.81, or 8.8%, to 22.31. Atmel gained 64 cents, or 12%, to 6.04 on Nasdaq.
Communications-technology companies were also at top of their game, with Cisco Systems gaining 1.01, or 7.8%, to 14.05. JDS Uniphase rose 32 cents, or 12%, to 2.90, and Ciena advanced 47 cents, or 11%, to 4.64, all on Nasdaq.
Electronic components and equipment companies were also top performers. American Power Conversion gained 1.04, or 8.5%, to 13.28 on Nasdaq. AVX rose 66 cents, or 4.5%, to 15.40.
While most sectors posted gains on Friday, precious metals and wireless-communications companies were among the laggards. In precious metals, Newmont Mining fell 56 cents, or 2.2%, to 25.44. Among wireless-communications companies, AT&T Wireless dropped 61 cents, or 11%, to 5.15, erasing some of its gains Wednesday.
Other active stocks Friday included Merck, which was in the news on several fronts. The company is the target of a shareholder lawsuit that alleges it made material misrepresentations about its finances between July 1, 1999 and June 21, 2002, thereby artificially inflating the price of Merck securities. Separately, Merck said preliminary data show its drug Zocor reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke. Shares gained 1.58, or 3.3%, to 48.86.
Despite a Wall Street Journal report that the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into Qwest Communications, its shares rose 12 cents, or 7.1%, to 1.82. Qwest said in a prepared statement that it had no reason to believe it was the subject of any such investigation. The stock recouped some of its losses from Wednesday, when shares were off 23 cents, or 12%.
Vivendi Universal also bounced back from some of its losses, gaining 1.61, or 10%, to 17.27, as shareholders remained hopeful that the company's new chief executive can keep the media giant from running out of cash. The stock had dropped 2.10, or 12%, on Wednesday.
