mal proportions. Again grain movement was above last year.
Tbe pick-up in the rate of operations for the steel industry is the really cheering factor in the outlook for ore traffic. While stocks of ore at many plants are large, the upturn for the industry means they will be reduced faster, and pave the way for shipments. Strength in Great Northern Saturday, which was one of the most active of the rail stocks, reflected the hope that this would, be the case. Great Northern is the largest mover of iron ore. and suffered heavily in 1932 from the drastic slump in ore traffic.
As far as the general loadings -outlook is concerned, Atchison’s traffic movement in the week ended April 23 was encouraging. Traffic over the road moved up above the level prevailing in the previous week. In 1932, the sharp, unseasonal downtrend began in that week, so that if the figures released next Saturday show a continuance of the recent upward trend it would be extremely encouraging.
Steel News Highly Favorable
Operations for the current week in the steel industry are put at 27% of capacity, the highest level in a long time. In not a single month in 1932 did operations for tbe industry’ as a whole reach that level, and in the upturn last fall, when many’ steel stocks sold at considerably higher pnccs than they’ have reached on the current upturn, the industry’ did not get up to the present rate.
The highest average for a full month’s operations reached last fall was 19% for the industry’ as a whole in October, according to the American Iron & Steel Institute. While there is no certainty as yet that the upturn in the steel business represents more than a temporary’ bulge, the average rate for tbe industry as a whole in April should be above 21%. In February, the average for the industry’ ran to 20.41%, and the bulge so far this month seems to assure a push through of ’ *	-	. -	-

Both the securities and commodities markets gave an exhibiiton of underlying strength in Saturday’s short session, pushing forward once again after the fairly sharp decline which took place in Friday’s active markets The improvement in bonds was most pronounced, with United States Government issues finishing higher on the day.
Trading in both stocks and bonds was heavy. Volume in stocks ran to 2.280.000 shares for the two-hour session, the largest since September 3. 1932. Trading was relatively* light in the first half hour, when stocks were highly mixed, and turned up abruptly*, with the tape lagging as much as 3 minutes behind the market, when the whole list surged forward yunder the leadership of the railroads and steel shares.
As trading in bonds ran to $9,432,000, the highest volume since February* 13. 1932. the whole market moved forward. The trend turned sharply’ in the second hour, with speculative and high-grade domestic issues pushing forward briskly*.
Commodities Surge Ahead
The performance in bonds and stocks was closely* paralleled in the commodity* markets. They* shook off .the weakness which cropped out in initial dealings; leading staples advanced. Cotton lost $1 a bale m the initial dealings, but more than regained its loss and closed up from 7 to 12 points. Wheat rallied abruptly, too, and ruled higher on the day*. New buying come into the market on the early dip. Sugar was strong: coffee moved up, and there were gains elsewhere among leading commodities.
While the hope that some agreement might be reached at the economic discussions under way in Washington was one factor buoying the markets, reports telling of a distinct improvement in business in various lines furnished added impetus to the markets The steel news was the best in a long time; railroad loadings showed an upturn over the previous week, although it was not as great as the upturn recorded in the like week of 1932, and there were other favoring developments.
Rail Average In New Ground
The pronounced strength in the rails finally carried the Dow-Janes average of 20 railroad stocks up to 30.66 at the close. At that level, the rail average had penetrated the trading area high of 30 61, set on November 12, by’ a fraction of a point. Conservative exponents of tbe Dow theory feel that a break through of a full point through a previous resistance level must be awaited before conclusive determination of a trend. However, in pushing fractionally’ through the trading area high, the rails have confirmed, at least partly, the previous action of the industrials
In addition to the rails and the steel stocks, the gold mining company shares were the stellar performers Saturday. Homestake reached a new top on a 5 point gain, closing at 204 "b, and Alaska Juneau was pushed up to 18 in an active market.

Heavy Week’s Trading
The trading volume for the week ended April 22 was comforting to brokers. Volume for the week reached 22.145,842 shares, a daily average of S.690,973 shares, and the highest weekly total and daily average since the week ended August 13, 1932. The big volume took place during the upward spurt of stocks in the late summer rise.
Miscellaneous Freight Moves T’p
The loadings figures for the week ended April 18 were peculiarly interesting in that they revealed that the advance was due almost entirely to an upturn in miscellaneous freight traffic. Loadings in this classification moved up 7.859 cars, more than offsetting decreases elsewhere. Another cheerful item on the loadings report for the week was the upward movement in ore loadings. While ore is still substantially below a year ago, it is picking up, and there are indications that ore movement this year may have a seasonal upturn of somewhere near nor*
