The new bull market hasn't begun, said Stephen Sachs, director of trading at mutual-fund group Rydex Investments in Rockville, Md. Stocks have traded on nine days in 2009, and the Dow's 6.6% new-year pullback, including a six-session losing streak, is the second-worst over such a period in the average's 113-year history.

The stock-market rally of the past eight weeks continued to unravel, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 248.42 points, or 2.94%, to 8200.14.
Some investors had begun thinking the worst of the economic and financial surprises were over and stocks were priced to reflect all conceivable bad news. Some believed a lasting rebound had begun.
Now, as more negative surprises hit, concerns are spreading that the bear market isn't over, and some people again are pulling back from stocks.
"I don't believe we are going to make massive new lows, but it is still a bear market. The new bull market hasn't begun," said Stephen Sachs, director of trading at mutualfund group Rydex Investments in Rockville, Md.
Stocks have traded on nine days in 2009, and the Dow's 6.6% new-year pullback, including a six-session losing streak, is the second-worst over such a period in the average's 113-year history. The weakest nine-session start to a year came in 1978, when the Dow fell 6.7%. That year it recovered to finish down only 3%.
The Dow's point and percentage losses Wednesday were the heaviest in more than a month, leaving the blue chips at their lowest level since Dec. 1.
The declines were led by financial stocks, hurt by news of Citigroup's plans to dismantle itself and Deutsche Bank's warning of a $6.33 billion quarterly loss.
A bank-stock index maintained by brokerage firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods fell 6% to 35.80, breaking below its November closing low to its lowest finish since 1995. Citigroup fell 23% to $4.53, finishing below $5 for the first time since Nov. 21. It is down 92% in the past 52 weeks. Morgan Stanley, now Citi's partner in the brokerage business, fell 9%.
The problems extended well beyond the banks. Sobering data on retail sales prompted investors to conclude that, contrary to their earlier beliefs, things can get worse than expected. On the New York Stock Exchange, 2,808 stocks fell and just 333 rose, the biggest gap between decliners and advancers since the 5 1/2-year low on Nov. 20.
The broad S&P 500 fell 3.35% to 842.62.
The breadth of the gains reflected fears that quarterly corporate profit reports will continue to be weak, and that the recession could drag well into the second half of the year or even longer.
On top of recent profit warnings came the announcement Wednesday that once-proud communications giant Nortel Networks had filed for bankruptcy protection. After regular trading ended, investors got more unsettling news. It was reported that Bank of America may need more government aid and Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs's health problems are forcing him to take a leave.In after-hours trading, Bank of America stock fell 4.7% and Apple, 6.5%.
Market analysts have been sending clients reports alerting them that, after the Dow's 34% decline in 2008, stocks were poised for at least a temporary rally. Some people have been moving money into stocks even during this year's pullback, betting that the rally will resume. But the market's sudden flop has made others doubt the wisdom of owning risky assets.
On Wednesday, some people moved back to the relative safety of Treasury bonds, pushing prices sharply higher and knocking the yield of the 10-year Treasury note down
to 2.215%.
The Dow industrials rose 19.6% from Nov. 20 through Jan. 2, the biggest rally since the bear market began more than a year ago and the biggest surge over such a short period in years.
In the eight days since Jan. 2, the Dow has given back more than half of that gain, and now is up just 8.6% since Nov. 20.
People who follow seasonal trends were especially disappointed, since December and January historically have been two of the strongest months for stocks. But the Dow fell in December. If it doesn't rebound this month, some analysts will worry that a decline for the full month of January historically has augured poorly for performance in the rest of the year.
Investors ordinarily are moving new retirement savings into stocks in January. If stocks decline, it means investors are making a conscious decision to break with normal practice. Last year, January selling led to the third-worst year in the Dow's history.
