The Nasdaq composite's Friday rally of 242.09 points, to 3316.77, took it out of immediate danger of dropping below 3000, and it wound up just 1.3% lower for the week. Friday's point gain was the index's third-best ever, and the percentage rise of 7.87% trailed only the record 7.94% rally of this past May 30.
It will take several more days like Friday to pull the Nasdaq composite out of its bear market . The index, dominated by the biggest Nasdaq stocks such as Microsoft, Oracle and Intel, remains down a sobering 34% from its high in March (drops of 20% or more are considered a bear market for an index). Neither the Dow industrials nor other major indexes are near to bear territory, but all major U.S.-stock indexes remain in negative territory for the year.
On Wednesday both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq experienced their fourth-busiest days ever, while Thursday's tumble was accompanied by the fifth-heaviest trading day on the NYSE and the ninth-heaviest on the Nasdaq.

Is that all there is?
After enduring a week that at one point looked like Armageddon for the stock market, but ended on Friday with an explosive rally, investors are left struggling to figure out if the worst is over on Wall Street.
Indeed, some Monday-morning quarterbacks are saying that the classic signs were there, before Friday's near-record 7.87% skyrocket in the Nasdaq Composite Index, that the stock market may have bottomed out and was ready to rebound. These signs included panic selling by investors, heavy trading volume, rising "put" contracts in the options markets and a quick, sharp drop in prices.
Thus, the ability of the market to respond to Thursday's drubbing of both Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average with the strong bounceback on Friday probably shouldn't have been a shock.
But this remains an unpredictable stock market. With tensions still high in the Middle East, and stock-price valuations still high by many measures, investors should keep up their guard, many analysts say.
"If people say they're not worried, they're not exactly telling the truth," said Ken Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen in New York. "It's great to see the market bouncing higher [on Friday], but we're not out of the woods; the market has a lot of work to do to get out of this situation."
Indeed, with many investment portfolios still in the red for 2000, investors certainly aren't bailed out merely by Friday's rally. The industrial average on Friday, a day after plunging 3.6% to near the 10000 marker, bounced up 1.6%, or 157.60 points, to 10192.18. For the week, the average gave back 3.8% and remains near its lowest levels since March.
The Nasdaq composite's Friday rally of 242.09 points, to 3316.77, took it out of immediate danger of dropping below 3000, and it wound up just 1.3% lower for the week. Friday's point gain was the index's third-best ever, and the percentage rise of 7.87% trailed only the record 7.94% rally of this past May 30.
But it will take several more days like Friday to pull the Nasdaq composite out of its bear market. The index, dominated by the biggest Nasdaq stocks such as Microsoft, Oracle and Intel, remains down a sobering 34% from its high in March (drops of 20% or more are considered a bear market for an index). Neither the Dow industrials nor other major indexes are near to bear territory, but all major U.S.-stock indexes remain in negative territory for the year.
Stock tumbles usually end with a bang, not a whimper, say stock-market historians. Only when most of the market turns pessimistic, and starts selling, can there be much hope of a turnaround. That's because the market needs cash to accumulate on the sidelines, ready to find its way back into the market, before it can rise.
On Wednesday both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq experienced their fourth-busiest days ever, while Thursday's tumble was accompanied by the fifth-heaviest trading day on the NYSE and the ninth-heaviest on the Nasdaq.
There was a "spike in trading volume and a rapid swing in investor sentiment to excessively bearish levels," said Charles Blood, senior strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., who said the market clearly had bottomed out and investors did well in deciding to scoop up shares.
Rising numbers of put contracts, or option contracts giving investors the right to sell stocks, were another classic sign of excessive nervousness that generally precedes a turnaround. Some analysts said they would have preferred if the market fell a bit more before turning upward. If enough excess isn't wrung out of the market , it can't sustain a lasting rally, they said.
Investors were "getting more cautious, things [were] moving in the right direction," said Richard McCabe, Merrill Lynch's chief market analyst. "I don't trust [Friday's] upturn," he said, but if there's another sell-off in coming days, "that could get us to the start of a bottoming process."
> With tax-loss selling by mutual funds likely to crest late this month, as most mutual funds close the books on their tax year, selling pressure could abate.

Just how bad did the rash of selling get last week? "Clients [were] calling me to say they can't sleep at night, they're sick to their stomachs, questioning their resolve," recalled Rick Eakle, president of Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J., who advises hedge funds, among other investors. Many of these investors decided that they saw a buying opportunity on Friday.
If one considers what happened on Friday to be "bargain hunting," remember that it's a relative term. Yes, stocks had gotten cheaper, but most analysts still didn't consider them "cheap." Stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index now trade at an average of 26.47 trailing 12-month earnings. That's down from the all-time highs of 34 in June of last year, says Birinyi Associates, but well above the post-World War II average of 15.
Alan Kral, a money manager at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen Inc., is buying oil, defense and some financial stocks, but steering clear of technology stocks, arguing that they're still priced too high.
"Corporate earnings ought to look good going into next year, and we don't see a recession, but the issue for the market remains [high] valuations," he said.
Another fly in the bulls' ointment: oil prices. If hostilities escalate further in the Middle East, oil prices are likely to keep going higher. While the U.S. economy is no longer as dependent on oil as it once was, rising prices would weigh on many companies, and hurt foreign economies such as Japan's. Perhaps more important, if oil prices keep rising, it will make it hard for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates as the U.S. economy slows.
"It's tough to buy when there's a geopolitical event going on; there are too many things going on for now for fundamentals to rule," said Mr. Kral.
Even if the market builds on Friday's strength in the weeks ahead, some investors will be tempted to sell, unwilling to stomach the market's violent lurches. SG Cowen's Mr. Sheinberg, himself a bull, noted: "There's [still] massive pessimism out there."
Friday's Market Activity
High-technology issues paced the gains, as optimistic news about third-quarter profit performances countered the pessimism that has prevailed for weeks.
Juniper Networks leapt $28.89, or 15%, to $228.50 on Nasdaq after the Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of Internet-switching equipment posted better-than-expected earnings late Thursday.
Several other tech bellwethers that analysts regard as having a rich valuations also made progress, including EMC, which gained 9.19 to 94.94. Cisco Systems rose 6.25 to 56.06, and Sun Microsystems, jumped 13.06 to 111, both on Nasdaq.
PMC-Sierra, the Canadian developer of semiconductor technology, climbed 32 to 190.44 on Nasdaq, after posting third-quarter results late Thursday that showed sales doubled from a year ago.
The session did include adverse reaction to profit statements from high-tech companies. Cree, a Durham, N.C., developer of semiconductor materials, fell 7.44 to 87.63 on Nasdaq after its release late Thursday of fiscal-first-quarter profits.
Some stocks investors sold Thursday on worries that higher oil prices could hurt their sales managed to recover. Boeing gained 2.63 to 58.75, while United Technologies rose 1.69 to 69.69.
In addition, several banking and financial issues, down sharply for the week, rallied back. Citigroup gained 3.06 to 49.81, Chase Manhattan added 1.88 to 39.69 and J.P. Morgan rose 7.13 to 143.13.
Among brokerage issues, Lehman Brothers added 7.63 to 119.69, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter advanced 7.19 to 78.19 and Merrill Lynch rose 3.13 to 58.13.
Veritas Software moved up 19.17 to 140.81 on Nasdaq. The Mountain View, Calif., developer of storage-management software reported third-quarter results that easily topped Wall Street's forecasts.
Cerner (Nasdaq), a developer of information systems for the health-care industry, rose 8.88 to 49.88, establishing a 52-week high during the day, after the Kansas City, Mo., company released third-quarter results late Thursday.
Redback Networks, recovering from a decline Thursday of 8.8%, shot up 18.83 to 121.52 on Nasdaq. Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the Sunnyvale, Calif., provider of networking software, which released its fiscal second-quarter earnings late Wednesday.
DoubleClick fell 5.69 to 12.44, 52-week low on Nasdaq. The New York Internet advertising and marketing concern reported third-quarter results late Thursday that matched analysts' projections, but investors reacted pessimistically to forecasts that the company might not turn a profit in early 2001.
Microchip Technology added 2.63 to 31.56 on Nasdaq. The Chandler, Ariz., semiconductor maker reported fiscal-second-quarter earnings late Thursday that matched Wall Street's forecasts, and the company said it is comfortable with analysts' forecasts through its 2002 fiscal year. Chase H&Q boosted its rating on the stock Friday to strong buy.
First Data gained 2 to 43.69. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray raised its rating on the Atlanta provider of transaction-processing services.
