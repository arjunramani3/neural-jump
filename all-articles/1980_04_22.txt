Stocks Explode on Interest Rate Drop; Industrial Average Soars 30.72 Points
Abreast of the Market
By Victor J. Hilleby
Falling interest rates helped spark an explosive stock market rally yesterday that catapulted the Dow Jones industrial average 30.72 points in trading of almost 48 million shares.
Finishing at 789.85, the industrial average's gain was the biggest since its record 35.34-point surge on Nov. 1, 1978.
Fuel for the upswing, analysts said, came from news that Treasury bill yields Monday had fallen more than a full percentage point in one of the steepest declines on record. The average return for 26-week issues dropped to 11.892%;
yesterday the rate eased to 11.67%. Also, several major banks recently have cut their prime, or key lending, rate to 19^% from 20%.
“The market had been ready to rally on a technical basis," said Hildegard Zagor-ski, assistant vice president at Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc. From its 1980 high of 903.84, set Feb. 13, the industrial average fell 144.71 points to 759.13 on Monday, its lowest level in more than two years.
Because the index rallied after falling Monday to slightly below 759.98, a low reached March 27, technical analysts contend that the market had made “a successful test of its 1980 lows.” This occurrence encouraged some traders to buy.
Michael T. Murray, vice president of Loomis, Sayles & Co., Chicago, agreed that the drop in Treasury bill rates and the successful test of the lows were two important factors in the market’s climb yesterday. Another factor, he said, was “some better inflation news."
He cited the announcement yesterday that consumer prices in March rose a sea
sonally adjusted 1.4%, which was less than some forecasts. He also noted the comments of Robert Russell, director of the Council on Wage and Pnce Stability, who told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that with just a leveling off of interest rates there will be a four-point drop in the consumer price index. He predicted a noticeable inflation decline by summer.
Mr. Murray added that “indications of a complete change of investor sentiment” will require "a strong follow-through” today to yesterday's substantial advance.
“There's an awful big pool of cash on the sidelines,” asserted William A. Goldstein, executive vice president of Burton J. Vincent, Chesley & Co., Chicago. “The people holding that money are looking at the slide in niterest rates and they’re fearful of a stampede developing if money starts moving out of money funds into stocks,” he added.
Mr. Goldstein said too that yesterday’s rally had been portended by the recent strength in the Dow Jones utility average. He noted that it had regained more than 60%. of its February-March decline.
Besides "the large amount of cash on the sidelines and a thin market,” Newton
D.	Zinder, first vice president at E. F. Hutton & Co., said that some recent recommendations contributed to yesterday's upswing.
Some of these recommendations came from Joseph Granville, a private investment adviser who wields considerable influence. Yesterday he advised his clients to cover their short positions and purchase some issues that he favors. A person sells short, or assumes a short position, when he sells borrowed stock: he covers those positions when he buys shares in the open market to replace the borrowed shares.

Stocks Soar on Interest Rate Drop;
Industrials Advance 30.72, to 789.85
Cmtbmed From Page t prices "should have discounted much or most of a forthcoming recession in corporate earnings," contended John W. Schulz, senior vice president at Brean Murray, Foster Securities Inc. He added that "whatever earnings contraction the recession may not have discounted could be more than compensated for by rising priceearnings multi^es.”
The wide sweep of yesterday's advance was underscored by the more than 1,400 New York Stock Exchange issues that registered gains, five times the losers.
Big Board volume, heaviest in the first and final hours, expanded to 47,920,000 shares from 27,560,000 on Monday. The stepped-up institutional activity was apparent in the climb in trades of 10,000 shares or more to 638, more than twice the prior day's 301 total.
The American Stock Exchange index jumped 11.33 to 245.03 for its second biggest singleday climb on record. Gainers led losers by better than four-to-one. Volume swelled to 4,970,000 from 2,780,000 Monday.
