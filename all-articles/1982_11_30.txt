Industrials Climb 36.43 to 1039.28 For Fourth-Largest Gain on Record
By Victor J. Hillery
With technology and blue-chip issues sparkling, the stock market erupted in a late rally yesterday that propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 36.43 points for its fourth-sharpest gain on record. Turnover expanded to more than 93 million shares.
The industrial average closed at 1039.28; after showing a loss of 4.51 points Monday the index was up a little more than one point early yesterday and ahead 8.74 points at 2 p.m. EST before its late leap. The transportation indicator ended at 444.39, up 20.00 points, its biggest gain since the indicator was revised Jan. 2, 1970. The utility average also moved higher.
“With the plunge in bond prices on Monday, the stock market had every reason for a big sell-off, but instead volume tended to dry up on the downside, and the bulls became convinced they weren’t wrong,” asserted Jerry Hinkle, manager of trading at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
More than 1.245 New York Stock Exchange issues moved up, three times the losers.

the expectation that market would decline.
“Too many peo-
of the Market
pie had been expecting the market to fall to the mid-900s of the industrial average,” commented Don Kim-sey, senior market analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Richard Yaschewski, director of technical analysis at Butcher & Singer Inc., said: "The market had become oversold enough to support a rally back to the 1040-1050 area. But we don’t think it will go much further than that."
Noting that the principal market averages had registered a modest correction of about 5% since early November, Leon G. Cooperman, investment policy committee chairman at Goldman, Sachs & Co., said that “some continued backing and filling is likely over the next month or two."
But, he added: “We would expect the bull market cycle to resume at levels that aren’t much lower than currently. The ‘Prince Charming’ of this bull market, lower interest rates fostered by the Federal Reserve, followed by economic recovery, is expected.”
Donald D. Hahn, market strategist at Warburg Paribas Becker—A.G. Becker Inc., asserted: “We feel strongly that this bull market is for real and will surprise most investors by its magnitude and duration.”
Mr. Hahn added that “there seem to be only two realistic risks that could end the advance prematurely.” He said "one is that a large foreign country defaults and/ or repudiates its debts,” and the second “is that the U.S. economy does not respond to monetary stimulation and lower interest rates.”
