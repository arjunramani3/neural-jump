The year 1932, which has furnished security holders with a wide variety of thrills, had the grace to die easily and quietly. Wall Street, which has taken a good many shocks in the past 12 months, was happy that the final session saw stocks maintain a firm undertone, even though prices were irregular, and the early strength petered out.
If the stock market wasn’t exciting, and the price trend was mixed, the bond market furnished some year-end chedr. Prices were generally better. Kailroad obligations, particularly the highest-grade bonds, and public utility issues* of the best grade were in demand. Treasuries were irregular. The foreign list was firm. The cotton market was closed for the day. Wheat ranged a little higher.
Buoyancy at the opening of the final session was most marked tn the leaders like American Can, Steel common and Allied Chemical. Selling for cash, to establish tax losses, confused but did not unsettle the list. The continued weakness in tobacco stocks, however, had a disturbing effect, and the strength in the general list faded out. The list maintained a firm tone, however, as the year’s stock market ended.
There were a few extraordinary moves. Crucible Steel, after the close, had been printed on the tape, ran up from 18 to 20 in three sales. The finish was a gain of 9 points on the day, and the stock was only 3U under the year's high. United Carbon ran up in a string from 13 to 14, a fractional gain on the day. The list elsewhere was quiet.
There was nothing in the day’s news to animate the stock market. The steel trade reviews pointed out that operation in the industry would start the n^w year at 14% of capacity, low enough	still a good recovery
from the holiday shutdowns. Wall Street is buoyed by the ho:>_* that the first month of 1933 will see a sustained upward movement in the steel operating rate In addition, there has been some buying «>; steel stares in consequence of the reports of the pctj.uhllity of another wage cut in the not distan • future.
The weekly report on carloadings for the country as a whole which usually appears on Saturday was delavrd by -the holiday, and will not be made public until January 3. It is pretty ! well established th<i t. due lo the shift in the | day of the week or. wnxh Christmas fell, the ! compilation will tcC' in an upturn over the like ' 1931 week. While nu clear definition of the loading trend will b. apparent until after the first week of January, m comparison with the like week of the prevous y^ar. in railroad circles there is a feeling that m cite lorepart of 1933, loadings will surpass the 1932 period figures.
faced, solutions have been reached which have brought almost immediate and startling improvement. The shining example of such action, internationally. In 1932 was the signing of t>e Lausanne accord. It was followed by a rally in world security and comomdity prices, etnd has put one country, Germany, <m the road to recovery.
'North American Aviation
The majority of the recent buying in North American Aviation is attributed to interests closely associated with Aviation Corp, and others * recently connected with the latter company. The recent contest between E. L. Cord and the management of Aviation Corp, for control of the latter company, came to a head with the proposal for acquisition of North American by Aviation Corp. However, negotiations for this merger ceased with the organization of the new management of Aviation Corp, and the current buying is not being done with a view to amalgamation of the two companies, it is stated authoritatively. The view is that the acquisition of a large stock interest in North American Aviation is being accomplished by Individuals desiring positions on the board.

The Month in the Market
December was a month fraught with exciting financial events, particularly the alarums and excursions over the war debt payments, but the stock market, during the month, moved in a narrow range, undisturbed by day to day happenings. Its ability to maintain its equilibrium furnished testimony to the list’s underlying strength.
On November 30, the Dow-Jones average of 30 industrials closed at 56.35, and the rail average at 25.04. The industrial average, throughout the month held within 6 points of the November close, and the rail average within 3. The French debt default, a volume of tax loss selling in securities which proved unexpectedly large, a flood of rumors of impending railroad receiverships, and reports of the imminence of a reduction in cigarette prices could not shake the general list out of a narrow trading rut.
The month’s trading only served to extend the process by which the market, since October 10, has been making a long line. Since that time, the industrial average has fluctuated m a 10-point range, and the rail average in a 6-point area.
One Among Many
The year has not been a glorious one for the railroad's, to put it mildly, but one major carrier, the Chesapeake & Ohio, has been able to achieve a unique record. It has continued, throughout 1932, the same dividend it paid in 1929, and it has earned that dividend by a good margin. It is about the only road which, during the depression year, contracted a bank Ioan, and paid it off before the year ran out. The final instalment on the $2,500,000 loan contracted by the road in the spring was paid off on November 17.
The Chesapeake Corp., holding company which controls the Chesapeake & Ohio reduced its annual dividend rate during the year to $2 from $3. but it accomplished a good deal in the way of paying off debt. Bank loans were cut from $32,000,000 to $31,000,000, and will be further reduced by another $500,000 payment shortly. Operations of the sinking fund have reduced the principal amount of the company’s convertible, collateral trust 5% bonds outstanding by roughly $1,100,000.	•
Facing Beallties
Harry F. Sinclair will find many to disagree with him in his statement as to the effects of proration on the oil industry, but there should be unanimous agreement with his assertion that realities must be faced, if there is to bo any solution of the problems which stand in the way of recovery. If 1933 brings a greater willingness on the part of men in business and public life to face those realities, then the year will see the soundest possible basis laid for world recovery.
Governments r.nd business have had some disastrous experiences in the past few years when they undertook operations, or carried on policies, which did not envisage the realities of the situation. .Where the facta have been
