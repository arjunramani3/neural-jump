NEW YORK — The bond markets slumped yesterday, snapping a weeklong rally.
Prices of some long-term Treasury issues fell about a half point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount of securities. Analysts said yesterday's stock market rout unnerved many bond traders and investors, eroding the optimism that had pervaded the credit markets since early fast week.
The steep drop in stock prices appears to be causing a "genera! loss of confidence” among investors m the bond markets, said Robert A Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Stock prices registered their biggest decline in more than two months, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 43.31 points to close at 1817.21.
Junk bonds, or high yielding securities issued by corporations with low credit ratings, were hit especially hard in the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission's continuing investigation into insider trading among Wall Street professionals. Many junk bonds fell by two or three points, following declines of about a point Monday, according to Jonathan Kolatch, director of corporate bond research at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
Paul McCulley, vice president and financial economist at E.F. Hutton & Co., said the stock market's problems and the drop in junk bond prices is causing a general "fear of the unknown" m the credit markets But he argued interest rates aren't likely to change significantly in coming months. "The economy is acting a little better" and neither a boom nor a recession is m sight, he said.
The Commerce Department today is scheduled to release its latest estimate of the economy's third-quarter performance. Many analysts expect the report to show the economy expanded at a faster clip than the 2 4% annua! rate originally estimated by the government a month ago. Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Refco Partners, believes the third-quarter growth rate will be revised to 2.8%, after adjusting for inflation. In the second quarter, the economy expanded at only an 0.6% pace.
Mr. Maude also estimated that business activity is growing at a 2%% rate this quarter and predicted an even slower 1%% growth rate for the first quarter of 1987. "The economy is still very sluggish and the manufacturing sector remains in recession." he said.
The Federal Reserve System will cut its discount rate to 5% from 5%% by the end of next year’s first quarter in an attempt to bolster economic activity, Mr. Maude predicted. He argued that such a move is “necessary” to keep the economy from going into full-fledged recession. The discount rate is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions
Mr. Brusca of Nikko Securities disagrees He contends the economy is accelerating and doesn’t need any additional stimulus "The Fed would be well advised not to change policy," he said, arguing that easier credit conditions could risk rekindling inflationary pressures.
The economy is expanding at a 3*4% clip in this quarter and will grow at a 4'4% rate next quarter, according to Mr. Brusca’s forecast. He predicted the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, now about 7k>%, will rise to 8'4% by year’s end.
In the credit markets, the Treasury’s 7*4% bonds due 2016 closed on some dealers’ quotation sheets at 9944 to yield 7.52%. That compared with Monday's close of 100 "4 where the yield was 7.48%. The government's 7'4%. notes due 1996 fell to 99 30/32 from 100'4, raising the yield to 7 26% from 7.21%.
Among short-teim securities, the latest 13-week Treasury bill closed at 5 35%, bid, compared with an average rate of 5.39% set at auction Monday. The bid on the latest 26-week bill declined to 5.41% from an auction average of 5.44%.
On the corporate front, a $250 million issue of ICI North America Inc. debentures due 2006 was offered to investors through underwriters led by Goldman Sachs. The 8I»% debentures, which are guaranteed by Imperial Chemical Industries, were priced at par. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. and single-A-pIus by Standard & Poor’s Corp.
In the market for municipal securities, a $126 million offering of bonds by the Metropolitan Denver, Colo., Sewer Disposal District No. 1 got off to a brisk sales start. About $56 million of the bonds remained unsold among underwriters as of yesterday afternoon, according to some estimates A group led by Salomon Brothers Inc. priced the bonds after auction to yield from 3.5%. in 1987 to about 6 81% in 2012. The bonds are rated single-A-l by Moody’s and tripleA by S&P.
Separately, another group led by Salomon Brothers lowered yields on most portions of a $355.2 million offering of revenue refunding bonds by the Southern California Public Power Authority. Under the new scale, yields range from 4 3% on bonds due in 1988 to 7.166% on those due in 2015. The original proposal called for yields to range from 4 4% m 1988 to 7.187%, in 2015.
Underwriters headed by Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. revised some terms on an offering of about $106 million of refunding revenue bonds by the Ohio Building Authority. Under the new scale, yields range from 5.25% on bonds due in 1991 to 7.214% on those due in 2009. Originally, the bonds had been priced to yield from 5.25% m 1991 to 7 25% m 2010
A group led by E.F. Hutton restructured an offering of about $105 million refunding revenue bonds by the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority. The underwriters eliminated bonds due in 2001 and 2006 and raised yields on two remaining portions. Under the new terms, bonds due m 1996 now yield 7.5%, while those due in 2012 now yield about 8 07%. Under the original proposal, the yields would have ranged from 7 25% in 1996 to 7.875% in 2012.
