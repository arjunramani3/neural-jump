NEW YORK -- After two quarters of dismal performance that make Wall Street an odds-on bet to post losses for 2002, U.S. stocks got the final quarter off to a bright start, thanks to some cherry-picking of this year's worst-performing issues.
Shares of cyclical companies such as DuPont, which climbed $3.56, or 9.9%, to $39.63, and Alcoa, which added 1.45, or 7.5%, to 20.75, bounced off the lows for the year reached in Monday's third-quarter finale.
Tech bellwethers also made an across-the-board improvement. International Business Machines, which scored a 52-week low Monday, rose 2.86, or 4.9%, to 61.17. Cisco Systems, which likewise came in at its low for the year, added 46 cents, or 4.4%, to 10.94 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Chip and handset maker Motorola advanced 36 cents, or 3.5%, to 10.54.
There wasn't much, fundamentally, that keyed the turnaround, other than simply oversold conditions and some short-covering that took place as the trading day wore on, and the investors who had bet on further declines gave up.
If anything, economic data suggested that business conditions in the manufacturing segment of the economy have taken a turn for the worse. However, manufacturers such as 3M, which jumped 6.31, or 5.7%, to 116.28, Paccar, which climbed 2.42, or 7.2%, to 36.21 on Nasdaq, and General Dynamics, which increased 2.65, or 3.3%, to 83.98, all posted gains on the day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average put up some eye-popping totals on the day, especially in contrast to the woeful performance in September. It rose a total of 346.86 points, its best one-day advance in two months, since rising 447 points July 29; the rise of 4.57% brought the industrial average, which fell 17.8% last quarter, back to 7938.79.
"You have to treat this as another short-term rally in the context of a declining market," said Peter Green, chief market technician at MKM Partners, an institutional-equity trading desk in Greenwich, Conn., said yesterday. "It's a reprieve, more than anything else."
Danaher gained 3.60, or 6.3%, to 60.45, after an upbeat profit outlook. After the close Monday, the Washington, D.C., maker of factory automation and medical equipment said it was comfortable with analysts' estimates for its third-quarter and full-year earnings.
Forest Laboratories shot up 7.84, or 9.6%, to 89.85, outstripping the 52-week high that had stood since March 19. The New York drug maker said that its fiscal second-quarter earnings will come in well ahead of Wall Street's forecast, thanks to strong sales of its antidepressant products.
Verizon Communications, part of the telecom-services sector that has been such a loser this year, finished higher, adding 2.14, or 7.8%, to 29.58. The company backed its earnings projections for 2002.
Shares of a number of retailers dropped on worries about exposure to consumer spending that appears to be softening. Apparel retailer Aeropostale, one of the smallcapitalization names in the segment, slashed its earnings guidance for the second half of the year, saying that mall traffic had diminished. The stock fell 8.90, or 58%, to 6.50.
A number of other apparel retailers, such as Abercrombie & Fitch, which declined 1.47, or 7.5%, to 18.20, American Eagle Outfitters, which dropped 76 cents, or 6.3%, to 11.30, and set a new 52-week low, and Coach, which slipped 19 cents, or 0.7%, to 25.41, all fell in sympathy.
Circuit City, the Richmond, Va., consumer electronics retailer, completed the separation of its CarMax auto-retailing group. CarMax, which had been trading separately, gained 25 cents, or 1.6%, to 16.30.
Pepsi Bottling Group gained 1.60, or 6.8%, to 25. The Somers, N.Y., soft-drink bottler reported third-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street's forecasts, a relief to some of the analysts who had worried the company would miss its numbers.
Amazon.com advanced 1.02, or 6.4%, to 16.95 on Nasdaq. Bear Stearns raised its revenue and earnings estimates on the Seattle online retailer, citing, among other factors,
strong sales of electronics and the benefits of the company's promotions, such as offering free shipping with minimum purchases.

MGIC Investment rose 1.62, or 4%, to 42.45. Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on the Milwaukee mortgage insurance provider, whose shares fell to a 52-week low last week
on lowered profit guidance.
Nabors Industries lost 60 cents, or 1.8%, to 32.15. The Houston oil-services concern warned it will miss current Wall Street earnings projections for the second half of the year. The company said that anticipated improvements in North American natural-gas activities never materialized.
Boston Scientific added 72 cents, or 2.3%, to 32.28, helped by encouraging comments from RBC Capital Markets, which cited enthusiasm for the benefits of the Natick, Mass., medical-device maker's new stent products for heart patients.
