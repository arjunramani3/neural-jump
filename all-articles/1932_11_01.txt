wheat has maintained a level at which it can do an export business and we cannot. *
For'the TJnited States to'achieve wheat exports a workable price differential -between Chicago and other world wheat markets must be reached. If we do not export wheat we will have a heavy 'surplus in this country to depress prices.

The start of the new month found no change in the character of the markets from that which has prevailed for roughly three weeks. In a lifeless market, stocks drifted to lower levels, but there was no pronounced weakness in the general list. Bonds were soft most of the session, easing, under offerings. Wheat had another tumble, and closed off almost a cent a bushel. Cotton was steady, but closed down to 3 to 5 points.
Trading volume in stocks was a bit higher than that which prevailed Monday, and the market was heavy from the opening. At the close, which was near the day’s lows, losses in the leaders ranged up to 3% points, with a -number of stocks off more than 2. Allied Chemical opened at 73 Vi, off a half; Steel common started down at 35%, and Telephone, Union Pacific and Case were down fractionally.
Through the morning, the drift was toward lower prices. Union Pacific, among the rails, was a weak spot, dropping more than 3 points below its opening level. - -der some pressure, and sank under 40, where was off more than 2. Delaware, Lackawanna Western started off with an overnight loss more than a point and	the decline
more than 2.
Resistance was encountered to the decline sthe start of the last hour, and stocks dragged fractionally higher. In the final 15 minutes of trading, they slipped off again.
News Against Market
In addition to the further decline in wheat prices, the market had to face other unexpected unpalatable news. The reduction in the Socony Vacuum dividend was one item, and word on the Nevada banking situation was another. The Lieutenant Governor. .Acting Governor in the absence of Governor Balzar, issued a proclamation declaring a two weeks’ bank and business holiday, effective November 1. He declared that* 13 of the 26 banks in the state had taken immediate advantage of the proclamation, with others to be heard from. Governor Balzar is in Washington seeking Reconstruction Finance Corp. aid.
Chrysler lost ground, despite the declaration of the regular quarterly dividend, as result of the disappointing third quarter report. The company also announced price reductions.
Railroad loadings which made their appearance during the day furnished further indications that the peak of traffic for this year had been passed. The rival presidential -candidates’ speeches were hardly a factor marketwise, as neither added anything of importance to what he already has said during the course of campaign.
At yesterday’s close, the Dow-Jones rail industrial averages were at around the levels for the three-weeks’ trading range, industrial average closed at 60.22 with the average at 26.88. since October 13.
Freight
Eastern trunk early next month _	_	„
trade that all-rail freight rates on corn for export be reduced by 50% temporarily, while the Lakes are frozen and shipping on them impossible. Such a reduction has been urged to facilitate movement of prospective surpluses of the oncoming crop.
The steep decline in groin prices has brought in its wake intensive study of freight costs and numerous requests for reductions. There have centered, so far, on wheat and corn. On wheat the all-rafl from Chicago to New York, one of the export center* of the country, is 13% cents a bushel. In contrast, the combined water and rail shipping cost from Chicago to New York is about 8.80 cents. Naturally, with wheat at present low prices, any export business which has been done has sought the lowest rates possible and the railroads have lost any chance of getting long hand business.
In the grain areas of the Northwest, the low price of Azheat has led farmers to hold their grain on the farm, rather than to ship it to Chicago. Executives of some of the northwestern roads have discussed the possibility of cutting wheat rates to stimulate movement of grain, but they have agreed generally that with wheat prices as low as’ they are now. a cut in rates would not accelerate shipments appreciably. However, it was conceded that with any rise in grain prices it might be the part of wisdom to reduce rrtes temporarily to stiumlate the crop movement.	'
The Fall of -Wheat
The fall in wheat, which has brought about establishment of new record lows in Chicago almost daily, finds the major cereal seeking an exporting level. These declines, however, have been followed by similaV drops in Winnipeg, Buenos Aires and Liverpool, and United States wheat remains only a little nearer an export level, despite the heavy drop in Chicago. Stabilization efforts in the wheat market have proved a dismal failure, and economic forces are.working to bring about some solution of this country’s export surplus problem. '

Post-Election Markets
Post-election markets, since 1912, .have not brought abrupt changes in the course of stock prices. This year, of course, conditions are very different from what they were in the past •Ave campaigns, but the last -Ave elections are interesting in what they reveal.
In 2912, when “	' *	*
voted in to succeed market two weeks little change. The Dow-Jones industrial average stood at 90.29, and two weeks after it was at 90.05. In 1926 the Dow-Jones average on October 24 was at 105.15, on the day before election it stood at 107.21, and two weeks after it was at 110.25. In 1920 prices slipped moderately in the two weeks succeeding election. “	‘	‘
the trends both before and after pronouncedly upward.
In 1900 the price trend was late September, but the election	_
market a boost, and the Dow-Jones industrial average two weeks after the election was about 15% above the level ’which prevailed just before election day.
Oil-Company Dividends
The Standard Oil of New Jersey came through with the usual extra and regular quarterly dividend payments on the common stock, but directors of Socony-Vacuum voted a payment of 10 cents, against the previous 20-cent declaration. Socony-Vacuum stock was not Immediately affected by the' cut, selling at 9% a few minutes after the announcement, unchanged from the previous transaction. However, 'within 15 minutes the stock sold down below 9, on fairly heavy transactions. Halving the dividend rate cut the yield on the stock from just under 9% to around 4.4%, at the current price.	.
