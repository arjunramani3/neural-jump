Dew-Jones
optimism is more restrained- Steel ingot production in the week ended Monday was 12%, according to the Dow-Jones" compilation, compared with 13% in. the preceding week. -Of course, resumption of operations by several mills Tuesday is not reflected in the figures.* ~ The* present rate probably* is about 14%, or slightly better, and further slight gains are indicated.
-	American Brake Shoe
American Brake Shoe «fc Foundry Co. is a favored company in the railroad equipment industry. The stock rarely attracts a speculative following because of the stability of the company's ‘earnings and the- conservative policies of the management The company’s business Is almost entirely for replacement purposes, supplying brake shoes and parts, car wheels, track fixtures and a Use of steel castings and forgings. Despite the extraordinary decline in railroad buying this year, American Brake Shoe has been obtaining enough business to earn and pay a dividend at the rate of 60 cents annually on the common. Because of deferred maintenance on railroadsf equipment men believe Brake Shoe could obtain a large volume of business in the first few years of a general business recovery.
After a morning of indecision, In which prices were mildly reactionary, stocks bounded forward again under tbe leadership of the motor shares. Chrysler was a leader in this movement, pushing vigorously into new high ground for the year. General Motors, Mack Trucks and a long list of motor accessory stocks participated.
xn the' final hour advancing tendencies attained greater scope and many of the pivotal stocks which had lagged were taken in hand and whirled to their best levels for the current advance.
Publication at '2 p. m. on the Dow-Jones news tickers of electric power output figures for the week ended September 3 was an influence. These figures showed a decrease In power consumption of 10.4%, compared with tbe corresponding week of 1931, as against a 12.3% decline- from 1931 in the preceding week. Stone & Webster. North American and American Water Works moved, higher. The latter company was aided by declaration of the regular quarterly dividend of 50 cents earlier in the day. An increase of H cent a pound in copper prices to 6% cents brought renewed activity into the copper shares.
Bonds were* generally steady in active trading. The principal commodity markets quiet. Wheat brokers reported smaller trading interest than in several weeks and prices moved slightly lower most of the day. Cotton moved in a narrow range and closed firmer.

Kull Bond* Watched Carefully
Pending: conclusive evidence ot a broad business upturn, the action of speculative railroad bonds is being watched for an indication of the probable trend of stocks from here. Many are inclined to stay on the side lines insofar as the share market is concerned until prior obligations in the carrier group show evidence of more confident buying; at present levels. It was the reactionary trend in the rail bonds which brought much of the profit-taking: into the stock market recently. On Tuesday 10 second grade rail bonds used in the Dow-Jones average closed at 69.80, compared with the hig;h for this year of 74.70. reached on January 14. Ten high grade rails closed at 87.86 Tuesday, compared with a 1932 top of 89.25, reached on August 22.
Crude Oil Price Uncertainty
Twice recently there have been professional attempts to capitalize better market sentiment and start a demonstration in the oils on the theory that this group is behind the market. Each time the move has failed to attract much of a following. Many undoubtedly have been deterred by the uncertain statistical position of the industry at this time. One prominent oil executive, recently returned from Texas, expressed the view that the increase Ln output allowable of the East Texas field to 375,000 barrels daily from 325,000, just when seasonal decline in demand sets in, might be reflected adversely in crude oil prices. In California a reduction in allowable to 448.200 barrels daily from 475,600 has been recommended by the state curtailment committee.
Canning Business Seasonally Lower
American Can Co. and Continental Can Co. are entering the season when operations begin to decline. Most canning crops have been sharply reduced this year, with a consequently smaller pack and smaller earnings for the two can makers. Continental Can reduced its dividend this summer to a $2 annual basis, from $2.50, but thus far American Can Co. has maintained its rate of $4 annually, despite the fact that indicated earnings are well below it. American Can's dividend meeting is scheduled for the latter part of this month.

Many in the financial district are inclined to let their hopes run high when discussing steel prospects. Within the industry, however.
