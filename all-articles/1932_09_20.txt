Complete tabulation	of tho Dow-Joncs stock aver-	
ages, with charts, second from last pagt.
A. robust rally in United Aircraft common Ln the final 15 minutes of trading brought about a moderate upswing in the general list on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The late rally was accompanied by an Increase In trading volume over the levels which prevailed most of Xhe session. Bond prices were slightly firmer, with second-grade rails gaining ground. Wheat was up close to 1 cent a bushel and cotton gained 1 to 7 points.
The stock market was featureless until the last few minutes with trading apathetic and price changes mostly fractional. The opening was irregular, with changes largely fractional. During the first few minutes, early losses were extended slightly, with American Telephone, ex the quarterly dividend, off a small fraction and U. S. Steel common, at its low, down about half a point from its previous final price.
. Stocks finned up as the morning progressed, and in the early afternoon gains ranged from fractions to 2 points or more. J. I. Case, Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward all were firm, in sympathy with the better tone in the wheat market. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western was the strong spot among the rails, up about 2 points, and Canadian Pacific move ahead in larger volume.
The burst of strength in United Aircraft was accompanied by heavy volume. Blocks of 3,000 shares or more changed hands as the stock was whirled upward. American Telephone. Steel, and the pivotal rails moved forward easily in the last few minutes. Aircraft closed up more than 4 points; Telephone around 3, and Steel about a point.
The day's nows included announcement by United Aircraft of receipt of two foreign government orders, but the stock did not immediately respond to the news. American Can firmed up on the dismissal of one of the suits filed zagainst the company In connection with representations made in obtaining contracts with customers. Missouri-Kansas-Texas common and preferred were strong, stimulated by the statement of M. H. Cahill, chairman, that average dally loadings so far In September were more than 10% ahead of the daily average for the like period of August. Loadings still are sharply off from the September, 1931', level.
Republic Steel Corp, announced that orders received so far In September have been greater in total volume than in August. Requirements of miscellaneous consumers have recorded a distinct improvement.
Nickel Plate Note Deposits Pick Up
So far, deposits of New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad 6% notes, due October 1*. under the refunding proposal, have been coming in rather slowly, but in the past two days there has been some pick-up. Apparently, many noteholders fail to realize the gravity of the situation.
The Interstate Commerce Commission, in itir action on the refinancing plan proposed by the road, made it very clear that unless substantially all the noteholders assented to the plan approved by the commission, embracing a loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corp, to pay off 25% of the notes In cash and extend 75%’for not less than three years, funds for even the 257© cash payment would not be forthcoming.
Since the Commission announced Its refinancing proposal, the Nickel Plate notes, have dropped from a price of 59 to current levels of around 39. A purchaser of a note at 39, if the refinancing plan goes through, would receive $250 in cash and would be paying $140 for a new note with a face value of $750. His position in the Nickel Plate situation would be unchanged from that at present, for the new notes will be unsecured obligations, just as are the maturing obligations.
In receivership, the position of the maturing noteholders would not be a happy one. The notes they hold have no lien on the property, and the road's earnings this year will not even cover underlying bond interest.
The apathy of Nickel Plate noteholders toward the refinancing plan so far may be due to a hope that they may get a bettor offer. Close observers, at the present time, can see no prospect of this. ' Rumors also have been circulated that the company has been buying its own notes. Unquestionably, the company wishes it could have made such purchases, but it just hasn't the money.
in the past few weeks there has been a very noticeable pick-up in furniture buying, particularly by buyers for southern retail stores. The buying, they say, has been in the biggest volume in the past two or three years. -
A number of trade reviews have reported that the pick-up in business in-the_ South and Southwest has been particularly pronounced. It is directly traceable to the better feeling induced by the rise in cotton prices.
Hunt Directing Jersey's Activities
The drafting of executives of major industries, to assume responsibility for various nation-wide movements to bring about a general betterment in business, has brought added responsibilities to certain junior executives.
During the temporary absence of Walter
C.	Teagle, president of the Standard Oil Co. (New Jersey), to devote his full energies to the national movement for sharing employment, executive direction of the company's activities is being carried on by S. B. Hunt. Mr. Hunt is vice president and treasurer of the company. He ' has been identified with the Standard Oil interests since 1894, and has been a vice president since 1919.
Bank Statement Inconclusive
As is frequently the case directly before a day of heavy Treasury financing, the reporting member banks’ conditions statement as of September 14 shows several large fluctuations which are of little significance. This past week, demand deposits rose $221,000,000, largely as result of the piling up in city banks of funds in anticipation of tax payments and subscriptions for the new Treasury issues. Part of the deposit rise, however, is directly traceable to the $23,000,000 increase In gold holdings and the $57,000,000 return flow of currency.
Thanks to the big influx of demand deposits, surplus funds were in abundance on September 14, as shown by the $107,000,000 rise In member bank reserve deposits and the $11,000,000 gain in" cash in vaults. Coincident with these gains, the demand for '"Federal funds*' practically disappeared. The repayment of “Federal funds" 'probably caused the larger part of the $74,000,000 drop reported in "all other" loans. "All other” loans, while consisting mainly of loans to business, Include a variety of other itwmw which have little or no relation to business borrowings, and for this reason fluctuations in the item should be interpreted with reservation.
While there is still a deflationary tendency in so-called rural banks, as shown by the gradual drop in their reserve deposits in the past three months, it is significant that these banks are paying off their indebtedness to the Reserve banks. The latter item for rural member banks declined $13,000,000 to $254,000,000 last week, bringing the total drop since July 27 to $57,000,000.
