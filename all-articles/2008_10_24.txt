On Friday and during the week, there was nowhere to hide as stocks from every sector and nation fell in unison. All 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday and are down 23% for the month, with Bank of America and chemicals maker DuPont among the weakest on the session, and General Motors, Alcoa and Caterpillar among the biggest losers during the past month.
Friday, the Dow fell 312.30 points, or 3.59%, to 8378.95, its lowest close since April 25, 2003.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500 fell 31.34, or 3.45%, to 876.77, to finish the week with a 6.8% loss at its lowest close since April 11, 2003. The tech-stock-oriented Nasdaq Composite fell 51.88, or 3.23%, to 1552.03, for a loss of 9.3% on the week and its lowest close since May 23, 2003.
"What's triggering it is borrowed money . . . in [stock and derivative] positions," said Jeffrey Pavlik, manager of hedge fund Pavlik Capital Management. "When those positions go against you, you have to put up more collateral or you have to sell those instruments."
"You're getting . . . moves that no one can forecast," Pavlik said. "To sit here and say the S&P 500 would be moving 5% a day . . . there isn't a person on the planet who would tell you that even six months ago."
Wall Street traders responded with gallows humor to yet another week of punishment. One trader at a midsize firm joked: "I'll look good as a bus driver."
Bank of America fell $1.93, or 8.4%, to $21.07. Many financial stocks fell as traders feared the repercussions of a world-wide slowdown for lenders.
National City fell 68 cents, or 25%, to 2.07 as it was forced into the arms of PNC Financial Services Group in a deal valued at $5.08 billion. As part of the rescue plan, the Treasury is investing $7.7 billion in PNC, which will help finance the transaction.
The Dow has fallen 15 of the last 19 weeks for an aggregate loss of 32% in that period. So far in October, the Dow is off almost 23%. If it finished the month with that deficit, the loss would mirror that of October 1987, the last crash, and exceed that of October 1929.
Selling was also rife in commodities and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries could not allay fears of weakening demand with their production cut.
Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 1.42, or 5.4%, to 24.86 after the copper miner warned an economic slowdown would continue pressuring copper prices. Shares of Freeport fell 25%.
Aluminum maker Alcoa fell 58 cents, or 5.8%, to 9.41, and finished the week down 20%.
Traders have begun to worry that developing nations, many of whom thrive on commodity exports, will struggle to support their financial systems in the same way that the U.S. and Europe have managed to do.
American depositary shares of Brazilian oil driller Petroleo Brasileiro fell 3.04, or 13%, to 21.05, and finished the week with a loss of 20%.
General Motors fell 15 cents, or 2.5%, to 5.95. The auto maker warned it was going to lay off more white-collar workers. Analysts predict the U.S. auto industry is in for a bruising October, after sales in September hit their lowest level in nearly 20 years. One research group, Edmunds.com, predicts U.S. auto sales will fall 30% this month from a year ago, with GM forecasted to post a 40% drop.
Traders are picking stocks in areas less dependent on the economy, like biotechnology. Amgen (Nasdaq) rose 1.62, or 2.9%, to 57.17 Friday, for a gain of 14% on the week. Third-quarter earnings surged for the maker of biotechnology drugs.
