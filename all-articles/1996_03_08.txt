ABSTRACT (ABSTRACT)
The week of Mar 11, 1996 promises to be turbulent on European and Asian financial markets following losses on Mar 8 that came in the wake of sharp declines in US stock and bond markets. On Mar 8 in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 47.9 points to 3710.3. Germany's 30-share DAX index closed down 11.82 points to 2469.12. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index gained 198.72 to 20155.87.
FULL TEXT
This week -- and Monday most of all -- promises to be turbulent on European and Asian financial markets following losses Friday that came in the wake of sharp declines in U.S. stock and bond markets.
The question is how bad will Monday be? European and Asian markets had already closed when the U.S. stock market recorded the bulk of its losses. Some 105 of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 171.24-point loss on Friday came after 4 p.m. in London (noon in New York). "On a typical European close, the market had already recuperated half its losses -- it hasn't allowed for the late drop in the U.S. -- so I think you will see a significant markdown in European markets," says Noel Mills, chief economist of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management in London.
Still, investment professionals say that this does not presage a longer-term downward trend. "We believe European [equity] markets will regain any falls we see now within 12 months," says Peter Sullivan, European equity strategist at Goldman Sachs International in London.
The U.S. reported Friday that the nonfarm work force had grown by 705,000 in February, indicating that the U.S. economy is growing more strongly than markets had expected. Until then, bond prices had reflected participants' expectations that interest rates could be cut once more in order to stimulate the economy.
That hope having been dashed, U.S. bond prices fell sharply, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury falling by 3 2/32 (about a 3.3% plunge) and its yield rising from 6.46% to 6.72%. "That pulled the rug out from under European bond markets," says a European bond strategist at Nomura in London. Bond markets throughout Europe tumbled, even in Britain where the U.K. Treasury earlier in the day signaled a quarter of a percentage point cut in base interest rates.
Stocks lurched lower as well. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 1.3%. In Paris, the CAC 40 Index fell 1.6%, as did Milan's Mibtel Index. Germany's 30-share DAX index closed down 11.82 points, or 0.5%, to 2469.12, but in after-hours electronic trading, the IBIS DAX fell 1.2%. The Swiss Market Index fell 0.8%.

"The correlation between U.S. and U.K. markets is very high, so any drop in American share prices will hurt British stocks," says Patrick J. Moriarty, a senior vice president at Evaluation Associates Capital Markets Inc., a money management and consulting firm in Norwalk, Conn.
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index tumbled 47.9 points to 3710.3, after moving widely between an intraday high of 3770.4 and a low of 3686.2. The FT 30-stock index slumped 34.1 points, or 1.2%, to 2760. Volume was 886.4 million shares, compared with 704.3 million shares a day earlier.
In Asia, the stock markets have more than U.S. activity weighing on them. China's military maneuvers, designed to intimidate Taiwan, also scare off investors world-wide by raising questions about Asia's long-term stability.
When trading opens today, Hong Kong's stock market is likely to be the hardest hit in the region, while Malaysia and Singapore also are probably due for sharp falls, says Paul Schulte, regional strategist at CS First Boston (Hong Kong) Ltd. In Thailand, stock prices for the highly volatile finance companies, which are very sensitive to rate trends, "are going to get slaughtered," he predicts.
In Hong Kong on Friday, stocks edged up and turnover dropped as foreign funds largely stayed away from the market because of fears of the worsening China-Taiwan relations and higher U.S. bond yields.
In Singapore, shares ended mixed, and in Kuala Lumpur, equities tumbled 1.4%.
Other Market Activity
Tokyo stocks advanced 1% Friday, spurred by buying by Japanese public funds and a strong rebound in the futures market.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index was at 134.85 on Friday, down 2.20, reflecting lower markets in Europe/Africa, Americas and Asia/Pacific regions. On Saturday, South Korea gained 1.66 to 146.02. The World Index finished Saturday unchanged from Friday at 134.85.
Fishing stocks were the top gainers in the Dow Jones World Industry Groups, closing at 82.12, up 1, or 1.2%, with Kyokuyo of Japan posting a 3.1% gain in its local currency. Biotechnology stocks trailed at 151.54, down 9.96, or 6.2%, with Biogen of the U.S. sliding 10% in its local currency.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, which slid 284.03 points Thursday, gained 198.72 to 20155.87. On Monday, the Nikkei fell 239.19 points, or 1.2%, to close the morning session at 19916.68. Friday's first-section volume was estimated at 1.35 billion shares, swollen by trading related to the special quotation to settle March futures and options contracts; in the previous session, turnover totaled 466.5 million shares. Gainers outnumbered decliners, 685-406. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first-section issues, which sank 21.73 points Thursday, rose 13.73 to 1543.90.
Early Tokyo selling was triggered by an impasse on Japan's government budget for the coming fiscal year and by aggressive unwinding of arbitrage positions on the special-quotation day for futures and options contract settlements. But an afternoon rebound by futures pushed the Nikkei back into positive territory, and buying by

public funds spurred a late rally. Steel issues surged, but some banks retreated as an early resolution of a bailout of failed mortgage lenders began to look doubtful.
In Sydney, prices finished mixed to lower in trading subdued by anticipation of this week's release of updated Australian government budget figures.
In Wellington, the market rose, boosted by forestry issues, which rebounded following weakness earlier in the week. In Manila, prices fell amid a search for fresh incentives during a wait for first-quarter profit reports by Philippine companies and effects of inflation; foreign investors focused on smaller issues. In Bangkok, stocks dropped, hurt by selling in the communications sector, which accounts for 24% of market capitalization; foreign investors shied away because of growing concern about the Thai trade deficit and inflation.
In Mexico City, shares lost 3.2%, their biggest one-day hit since Oct. 9, dragged down by Wall Street's plunge; for the week, the Mexican market was down 5.7%, also undermined by sharply higher U.S. bond yields and weak Mexican corporate results. In Buenos Aires, stocks shed 3.9%, after a jump in U.S. long-bond yields intensified selling sparked by Argentine news reports that Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo had lost power within the government because of agency changes. In Sao Paulo, prices dropped, after opening higher and stabilizing at lower levels, signaling the market had absorbed the shocks of a Brazilian congressional probe of the banking system and an impasse on pension reform.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index, calculated in local currencies, is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.
