Wall Street was beset by conflicting reactions to the developments in Washington yesterday, but the immediate reaction to the Washington news, marketwise, was a fairly sharp decline in security prices. White tbe outlook for unified action on a measure to provide for relief and to stimulate enlarged employment was encouraging, Wall Street's interest centered on the form it would take. This was not Immediately made clear.
The bond market, which had shown signs of easing in the morning trading, sold down sharply, with railroad issues suffering heavily. Weakness developed in commodities, with copper selling at a new low, and wheat more than canceled its gains of the preceding session.
At the day's close, the Dow-Jones average of 20 railroad stocks was at 19.27, off 1.31 on the day and more than a point under the previous low, set on April 13. It was the first time the rail average has dropped more than fractionally below this resistance point.
Prospect that the House and Senate might be unable to adjourn by June 10 was not helpful to sentiment.
A number of other developments during the day contributed to turn the market definitely downward. Reduction in the Union Pacific dividend payment to $1.50, compared wtb the $2.50 paid for the preceding quarter, caused a downswing in Union Pacific common, which was off more than 3 points on the day. Rail stocks generally were weak, with Atchison, New York Central and other leaders setting new lows. Weakness in railroad stocks was in part a reflection of declining prices for railroad bonds.
Pivotal industrials and utilities gave way with the remainder of the list, as liquidation came Into the market.
Sideline* Post Still Favored
In view of the current uncertainties, a sidelines position is still being advised. If the government's program, as finally outlined, contem-
plates a definite policy of embarking on inflation, a rise in stock prices undoubtedly would develop. Until the program is more clearly defined, however, a cautious attitude toward the market would seem warranted.
Decline in Carloadbig* I for May 7 Week
Loadings reports of individual carriers for the week ended May 7 show no let-up in the downward trend of carrier traffic. The decline from last year is widening, on a percentage basis, and figures so far published indicate that carloadings for the country as a whole for tbe week ended May 7 will reveal a decline from the total for the week ended April 30. A small dip would be seasonal, as In the past three years, loadings have slid off In the corresponding week.
individual carloadings show that carriers which serve almost all sections of the country suffered decreases. Central's loadings were down from the preceding week and were off 31.8% from the like 1931 week, as compared with fl drop of only 30.8% for the April 30 period. Pennsylvania's loadings showed a similar trend, with the percentage decline from the preceding year 31.0% against 28.8% in the week ended April 30. The Atchison. Missouri Pacific. Missouri-Kansas-Texas, and tbe St. Louis San Francisco all showed less traffic in the seven days ended May 7 than in the preceding week.
The drop in railroad loadings unquestionably Is due In part to the larger amount of the total available business now being handled by trucks. No definite figures on traffic handled by trucks are prepared.
Preferred Stock* Show Greater Stability	t
Leading preferred stocks, particularly American Can preferred, have shown greater stability in recent sessions. Can preferred Wednesday sold up to 105, up 5 points from the low, bo far this year, of par. Standard Brands preferred was up almost four points from the year's low.
Net income of American Can Co. In 1931 was $15,529,579, and preferred dividend requirements , amounted to $2,886,331, a coverage of about 5.3 times. There are outstanding 412,333 shares of the preferred stock, and at current prices, the yield is 6.6% on tbe $7 annual dividend.
Only roughly 97,000 shares of Standard Brands preferred was outstanding at the end of 1931, the company having purchased and cancelled approximately 50,000 shares during the year. Standard Brands had net Income in 1931 of $14,542,318, and total preferred dividends were $858,298. On tbe number of shares outstanding at the close of 1931, annual preferred dividend requirements would be in the neighborhood of $670,00. At its current price of around 115, Standard Brands preferred yields approximately 6%.
Public Service of New Jersey Earning* Hold Steady
Some long-pull buying has come into Public Service of New Jersey common during weakness recently, from interests encouraged by the stability of the company’s earning power, as indicated by the statements for the 12 months ended January, February and March.
, .nJfor the 12 months ended January, Public Service reported surplus After xiharges of $30,731,077; for the period ended February, $30,673,652; and for the 12 months ended March, $30,715,564.
At current levels, the stock is off roughly 25% from the year's high of 60 ,and is up about 7 points from the low of 38
liveries from pipe lines totaled 6,034,000 barrels of 42 gallons each, compared with only 642,000 barrels in the first quarter of 1931, an increase of more than 800%.
Roads like Atchison and Missouri Pacific have been among the heavy sufferers from diversion of this traffic to pipe lines. For the week ended May 7, for instance, oil and oil products loadings over the Atchison were off 36.7% from the like 1931 week.

Foreign Buying Here Walt* Better Defined Trend
Foreign interest in American securities has been negligible recently with foreign buying limited to purchases of high-grade bonds and a tew high-grade preferred stocks. Foreigners purchased stocks early in the year, and then cleaned out their holdings when Washington news became distinctly unfavorable. There is little expectation of any important foreign buying until the trend of the markets in this country is more clearly defined.
Pipe Line Run* Show Rail Traffic Lom
Some idea of the diversion of traffic from the railroads to pipe lines is given by figures for pipe line deliveries of motor fuel for the first quarter of this year, in comparison with the like 1931 period. During the quarter, de-
