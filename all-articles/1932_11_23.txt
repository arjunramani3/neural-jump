Complete tabulation of tho Dotc-Jones agea, with charta, accand from laat page.		stoefc over-
The securities markets did not take kindly to the overnight news of the non-productiveness of the conferences between President Hoover and President-elect Roosevelt on war debt matters. Stocks reacted to level of prices just above the November 3 and October 10 resistance points. Pivotal industrials were off as much as 5 points, and the general list closed at about the day’s lows. Bonds were heavy, all groups working lower in an extension of the downward movement.
Wheat rallied from the lows, but closed off about a cent a bushel. Cotton closed at the day’s lows, off 14 to 17 points.
Though the Persidcnt-elect’s reply to the President’s invitation for £ conference left little room for any expectation that a program of unified action would be agreed on, Wall Street had hoped against hope that something constructive would come out of the paTiey. Those hopes wefe dispelled by Governor Roosevelt’s reiteration that he was not at this time taking a position on the war debt matter.
The market was hesitant at the start, with most stocks off from Tuesday’s closing prices. In the first half hour, the list showed no great weakness, but by noon stocks were off anywhere from 1 to 4 points. Loew’s was the early weak spot, and gave ground easily. Weakness In General Foods continued, and Allied Chemical was soft.	.
The market steadied at the start of the final hour, and turned dull. In the late trading, it turned heavy again, with Coca Cola the sore spot. TJndcr insistent pressure, Coca Cola got down below 73, ’off more than 5 points, and closed only fractionally above the bottom. Selling by traders closing out long accounts before the holiday was a factor in the late downturn.
ing the day. the Erie’s was as good as any. October operating income was ahead of that for October, 1931. and the 10 months showing was surprisingly good, in view of what the road has had to contend with in the way of declining traffic this year. Monthly reports on anthracite traffic handled by hard coal carriers have indicated that the Erie has improved its competitive position. A number of the hard coalers have lost considerably more coal traffic than the Erie, on a percentage basis.	”
Signals Crossed
The threat of a big battle in proxies for control of the Aviation Corp, having been averted, cohorts of the two factions have settled down to gently challenging one another’s statements. Such mild exchanges are. at least, less costly than the advertisements run during the heat of the conflict.
LaMotte T. Cohu, president of the corporation, stated Tuesday afternoon that the scheduled board meeting had not been held because of the inability of members living in distant cities to be present. A few hours later, a joint statement by Frank A. Vanderllp and W. A Harriman declared that "an unadvised statement, quoting Mr. Cohu, does not present a correct view of the situation.”
The various Individuals involved in the troubles of the Aviation Corp, ought to get together, and not get their signals mixed.
Loew’s
Selling in Loew’s, which carried the stock down more than 4 points at one time in tbe early trading Wednesday, was belated recognition of the fact that changes in the company’s rate of amortization of film inventory undoubtedly will have an adverse effect on current earnings. Current earnings reports of other film companies, which have made similar readjustments in amortization rates, have immediately reflected the adjustments.

High and Low	Prices	
Wednesday, on the New York Stock Exchange, two stocks (American Chicle and Duquesne Light 57r pfd ) made new highs, and three stocks (City Ice & Fuel pfd., Coca Cola and Kelsey Hayes) made new lows, for the year 1932.
Loadings Fall to Help Kails
Railroad loadings statements appearing during the day, recording a general improvement in traffic over the previous week, did not stimulate the rails. A few of them held fairly well, but support came in only after substantial recessions. Atchison met buying under 40, and Union Pacific was supported at around 68. The electric output figures were not as poor as the Street had estimated they would be, but utility stocks suffered with the rest of the list. Case. International Harvester, Sears and Montgomery Ward all were reactionary, influenced partly by heaviness in grains.
Preferred stocks were generally reactionary. American Locomotive slipped off more than 2 points, hit by the elimination of the dividend. Utility preferreds, like American Power & Light and Electric Power & Light, sagged.
London Irregularly Higher
The markets abroad staged rallies In London. the list was irregularly higher. In Pans, the Bourse rallied, with only rentes lower. In Berlin, stocks staged a good upswing.
At the close, the Dow-Jones industrial average was only 1 point above the October 10 low, and 1.19 above the November 3 closing level. The railroad average, at 26.73, was 3.08 points above the October 10 low, and 2.53 above the November 3 bottom. Volume, Wednesday, reached 1,200,000 shares, against 500,000 Tuesday and 600.000 Monday.
Facing the Facts
Comptroller Berry’s program for effecting savings in the cost of New York city government is a full admission that the city must tackle the problem of putting its non-revenue producing ventures, like the femes and the subway lines, on a self-supporting basis Th** comptroller has faced some of the facts, at long last.
The figures which accompanied the comptroller’s report are illuminating for the taxpayers. They give a full idea of how far the taxpayers have gone in subsidizing the subway and ferry ventures, and for how long a period this has been going on. The 5-cent fare has cost the taxpayers enormous sums annually. From 1918 to 1923, the city carried in the budget roughly $9,000,000 a year, covering debt service on its rapid transit bonds outstanding, sold to cover the city’s part in the independent Company subway ventures.
Since 1923, amounts included in the budget annually have been stepped up, due to the expenditures on the city’s own subway lines. In 1932, the budget carried an item of $84,219,843 for subway costs, including capital amortization and this did not take in the expenses of the Transit Commission, of around $800,000, paid by the city.
Ferries and bridges, too, have been expensive for the city. The deficit on the ferries, which in 1924 was only about $730,000, now is close to $2,000,000. The city is out of pocket about $4,300,000 a year on the four big East River bridges, and has been since 1924.
* Kailroad Loadings
Loadings reports for a number of individual carriers indicate that the .figures for the country as a whole, for the week ended November 19, should make pleasant reading. Atchison’s loadings recorded a small gain over the week ended November 12; Central’s were up just short of 8,000 cars from the preceding week, and North Western and St. Paul both scored sharp gains in the week ended November 21 over the week ended November 14.
In Wednesday’s market, tho rails wore •firmer than the rest of the list, and showed resistance to selling pressure.
Central's traffic for the latest week was down only 10.5% from the similar week of 1931. This is the smallest decline from the similar week of 1931 for 1932 so far.
