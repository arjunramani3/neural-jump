Institutional favorites led the stock market’s explosive rally that rocketed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up a record 38.81 points on volume of 92,860,000 shares, the sqcond highest on record.
"The institutions were in a frenzy and went after their darlings,” observed Alfred
E.	Goldman, vice president of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.. St. Louis. “It was a delayed reaction to a strong bond market and the fall in interest rates," commented Keith F. Pin-soneault, research director at Blunt Ellis & Loewi Inc., Milwaukee.
The industrial average closed at 831.24, Its 38.81 point climb exceeded its previous record rise of 35.34 Nov. 1, 1978. The transportation index’s spurt of 15.21 to 314.52 was the biggest jump since the average was revised to include airlines and trucking companies Jan. 2. 1970; its previous sharpest rise was 13.65 points Nov. 18.1980. The utility indicator also took a big leap of
4.43	points.
The advance’s wide sweep was underscored by the more than 1,500 New York Stock Exchange issues that gained, 10 times the losers. The Big Board’s turnover, including 22,190.000 shares m the first hour, was exceeded only by the 92,881.420 total Jan. 7, 1981. Indicative of the institutional activity were the record 1.596 trades of 10,000 shares or more, up from 959 Monday; the previous high was 1,365 Jan. 7, 1981.
“Mr. Kaufman gave the bulls what they wanted to hear,” said ~	"
was referring to Henry Kaufman, Salomon Brothers chief economist, who predicted further substantial declines in both long and short-term interest rates with long-term	_
bonds, currently yielding about 12.5%, falling perhaps into the 9% to 10% range sometime within the next 12 months. This was a complete switch for the influential economist who on numerous occasions this year predicted that rates would rebound to records.
“The markets could no longer ignore the rapidly falling interest rates,” asserted Newton D. Zinder, senior vice president at E. F. Hutton & Co. “The new stance by Mr. Kaufman was the icing on the cake.” Most large banks recently cut their prime rate to 14 %% from 15% and some went to 14%.
Analysts noted that institutions recently have been holding heavy cash reserves. For instance. Indata's sampling of equity funds found that the cash assets recently reached 16.9%, which is a high for 1981-82 bear market.
Mr. Goldman said he viewed the market’s surge with “a jaundiced eye.” He asserted; “Normally, news doesn’t reverse a major trend, and we believe the trend is still down. The key will be when the market re-tests its previous lows.”
Mr. Pmsoneault contended "attention will now switch to the economic picture which is bleak.” He added: "We don’t think the market has made its bear market bottom yet.”

General Motors climbed 4% to 45%; International Business Machines, 3% to 66; Exxon, 1% to 26%; Sears Roebuck, 1% to 20%; and American Telephone, 2% to 55, al! in active trading.
