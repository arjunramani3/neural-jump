Industrials Plunge 57.20 Points; Technology Stocks’ Woes Cited
ABREAST OF THE MARKET
By Dmic.las R. Seasb
Some bad economic news and more unpleasant surprises from the technology sector pushed stock prices sharply lower yesterday.
A 16.2% decline in December housing starts overshadowed a modest 0.1% increase in the consumer price index to start stock prices on a downward trend from the market's opening. Later, a disappointing earnings report from Motorola, coupled with more negative opinions on International Business Machines, increased the downward pressure on stocks and stock futures. These factors touched off a burst of program trading shortly after noon that drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 65 points.
The average finished the day at 1879.14, down 57.20. Volume increased to 181.7 million shares from 153.6 million Tuesday, although three utility stocks accounted for about 15 million shares of yesterday's trading. Declining Issues on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 1,329 against only 333 gainers.
Analysts said investors were already uncomfortable following IBM’s worse-than-expected results Tuesday. Thus, the lower housing starts, which the White House characterized as "disappointing," increased the discomfort, as did a further weakening In the U.S. dollar.
“When you have IBM going down, it causes a broad spectrum of investors, traders and portfolio managers to adopt a more cautionary stance," said A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Securities,
Motorola's earnings, which were higher overall but showed a sharp drop in operating earnings from government electronics products, sent prices of its shares tumbling and further undermined confidence in the stock market. When futures prices slipped to a sharp discount from the prices of the underlying stocks, they touched off a round of sell programs that sent the Industrial average plunging.
"The market was in a slow slide from the start," said Robert Gordon, a stock index arbitrager with Twentyfirst Securities. “When the futures collapsed, the market went with them."
Yesterday's program trading marked the first time that the Big Board’s experiment In moderating stock price volatility came close to being tested. Under an experimental program in place this week, the exchange has asked brokerage firms to refrain from using the Big Board’s automated order placement system to execute buy and sell programs if the industrial average moves more than 75 points in a day.
Mr. Moore at Argus Research noted that selling dried up when the Industrial
average had fallen 65 points, indicating that traders may have pulled back from executing more sell programs for fear they would drive the average down to the point at which the restrictions would become effective,
“The market didn't have to drop 75 points for the limits to have an effect,” said Mr. Moore, "Discretionary speculative trades aren't going to be put on when the market is only 10 points away from an obvious stopping point."
Charles Clough, chief investment analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the overall atmosphere remains depressed for stocks. "Housing starts are coming in under expectations, earnings expectations are being eroded, interest rates haven’t dropped enough and the country still has an Immense trade deficit," lie said. “That's not the best prescription for a booming stock market. We need an environment where money and credit can be inflated a lot more rapidly."
Motorola was the focus of the decline in technology issues. The shares plunged 414 to 40% in heavy trading. IBM continued its decline, losing 1% to 110%, Digital Equipment dropped 414 to 115%; Unisys was off 1% to 3014; Compaq Computer fell 3% to 45%; Hewlett-Packard closed down 2% at 52%; NCR was off 1% to 54%, and Tandem was down 1 to 19.

A.H. Robins slipped % to 24%. Late Tuesday, it accepted a revised acquisition offer from American Home Products, ending a three-way takeover battle for the company. American Home fell 44 to 73%.
