Trading- Quiet as Market Awaits Hitler Speech and Reassembly of Parliament
Industrials Advance Slightly
frotn Trr Wall Street Jol-rsal London Bureau
LONDON—Recent downtrend in London stock markets was checked yesterday as sentiment became more hopeful than for several davs oast.
Financial Times industrial averages gained 0.1 point to 91.5 and rails 0.1 to 35.3. Modest as the gains were, nevertheless it was the first time since January 12 that the industrials had managed to show a net gain on the day. while it was the first time since January 3 for the rails.
Despite the better sentiment, there was little pickup in actual business. Chancellor Hitler’s speech scheduled for Monday and reR<^embly of Parliament here on the following day served to hold business in check. Nevertheless, reassuring speech made by Sir Samuel Hoare. to ■which the Stock Exchange has attached great prominence, coupled with the large vote of confidence given to Premier Daladier in the French Chamber of Deputies, completely offset any tendency to lower prices which might have accrued from overnight weakness m Wall Street.
Brokers here wexe surprised at the further slump in Wall Street on Thursday. It is realized that a bull position of modest proportions had been built up in Europe in American shares during the past few weeks, investors and speculators having been quite understandably impressed by America’s recovery prospects In such conditions, operators were vulnerable to any sudden setback in prices, and operators, mainly Amsterdam, sold out in view of extreme political nervousness and falling prices.
Closing prices of international issues in American equivalents follow- Chrysler $67 9-16,
