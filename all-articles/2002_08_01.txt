During the morning, the gap between two- and 30-year Treasury yields reached its widest point in the current monetary easing cycle, about 3.18 percentage points. That was only about 0.50 percentage point away from the widest margin seen during the last easing cycle, in September 1992, said Corey Redfield, chief fixed-income strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis.
In the past, that yield margin typically has reached its widest point when the Fed was believed to be nearing the end of an easing cycle and Treasurys investors were anticipating a strengthening in economic growth in the months ahead.
In the investment-grade area, Pall Corp., an East Hills, N.Y.-based manufacturer, sold $280 million of 10-year Rule 144a debt via UBS Warburg. The deal was set to yield 6.007%, or 1.6 percentage points above Treasurys. Ratings were Baa2 by Moody's Investors Service and single-A-minus by Standard & Poor's.

NEW YORK -- Another sharp drop in stocks and signs of weakness in the economy boosted Treasurys prices despite some selling of bonds ahead of the Labor Department's monthly employment report Friday morning.
At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 22/32 point, or $6.88 per $1,000 face value, at 103 24/32. Its yield fell to 4.389% from 4.473% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices.
At that level, the 10-year yield stood at its lowest since mid-November.
The 30-year bond gained 12/32 point to end at 101 9/32. Its yield stood at 5.287%, down from 5.314% Wednesday.
Manufacturing and construction data released during the session were much weaker than expected. That sparked selling in stocks while lifting Treasurys prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 229.97 points to 8506.62.
An important catalyst for the stock and bond markets Thursday was release of the Institute for Supply Management's monthly survey. Its manufacturing index fell to 50.5 in July from 56.2 in June. Forecasts had centered on a level of 55.0 for July. Above 50 suggests expansion.
Separately, construction spending -- which was expected to have risen 0.3% for June -- declined 2.2% for the month, reaching its lowest overall level since August 2000.
"Not only is the recovery moderate at best, it may be weakening, and we have yet to factor the recent declines in equities into the economic picture," said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley. "Talk of a Fed easing within the market is starting to gather," he said.
In Chicago, futures based on the Federal Funds, or overnight bank lending rate, were at levels suggesting a 50% chance that the Fed would trim rates by a quarter percentage point by late September. Wednesday, the market was trading at levels suggesting a 34% chance of such an easing.
Later in the trading session, the Treasury market's attention turned to Friday's employment release, which is seen as potentially key to the market's performance.
Bond yields have reached historically low levels, but it will take more weak economic data to keep them there, said MaryAnn Hurley, vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. "If we don't [get weak data], we'll definitely see a selloff," she said.
Economists look for modest growth in payroll employment for July and a steady unemployment rate. Economists in a Dow Jones Newswires-CNBC survey forecast a 68,000 increase in payrolls and the jobless rate unchanged at 5.9%.
Hurley said some trades Thursday represented wagers that long-term yields would rise in relation to short-term yields -- in market jargon, a steepening of the yield curve.

Corporate and High-Yield Bonds
Williams Cos. bonds rallied after the energy company said it had entered a series of transactions that would provide $3.4 billion in cash or available credit. Its 7 1/8% notes due 2011 were up 11 1/2 at 63 1/2 bid.

Elsewhere, Qwest Communications International bonds rose on a report that the company had begun talks on a possible settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the company's accounting practices. Qwest's 7 1/4% notes due 2011 were quoted up three points at 42 bid.
WorldCom Inc. debt gained about two points after former company executives surrendered in New York to face federal charges of financial wrongdoing. WorldCom's 7 1/2% notes of due 2011 were quoted at 14 1/2 and the MCI Communications Corp. debt was quoted at 41 bid. However, traders couldn't cite any way in which the news might actually improve recoveries on the bonds in an eventual restructuring.
In the investment-grade area, Pall Corp., an East Hills, N.Y.-based manufacturer, sold $280 million of 10-year Rule 144a debt via UBS Warburg.
