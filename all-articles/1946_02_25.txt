A breast of the Market
Wall Street Journal (1923 - Current file); Feb 26, 1946;
ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Wall Street Journal pg. 13
The industrial average closed yesterday at 187.23, off 8.39. This was the widest break since May 14, 1940, when it dropped 9.36 to 128.27 on the capture of Sedan, "which foreshadowed the fall of France. The 1940 percentage, drop was much greater than yesterday’s decline. Both the railroad and utility averages registered sharp declines. Thin markets aggravated the situation and brokers reported that some of the jhore active stocks suffered substantially even when the orders were comparatively small. It was the broadest market since November 7. 1945. with 1.056 different stocks traded. In spite of the break, 14 stocks made new highs for 1946 and there were 14 new lows.
Brokers reported there were no margin calls for those accounts which have been frozen on the 50% margin basis. However, some of these accounts were sellers. Thus they were unfrozen.
Yesterday’s decline plus previous setbacks, eliminated some 46% of the 42.86 points the industrial average had gained from V-J Day to the bull market closing high of 206.97 on February 2. last. In the last six sessions the industrial average has shown a net decline of 17.2 points.
With less talk of inflation in the Street, much gossip of poor first quarter earnings and reduced dividends, together with apparent confusion over the Government’s pnee-wage .policy, the Street reported many investors taking profits on long term holdings.
The break mainly was in leading industrial shares. Declines included Allied Chemical 192, off 4*2: American Telephone 186, off 7; Chrysler 120-%. off 7-%; duFont 183off S1??: Eastman Kodak 221. off 13; U. S. Steel 82 off 6X<; Atchison 98. off 3	;

At the close technicians were not making any predictions the market would turn although some said that after such a severe break a technical rally should be in order. However, in these days of cash markets the usual yardsticks are obviously not too useful

mounting rapidly and more orders are anticipated soon. Boeing Aircraft, for example, has been expecting for some time to close orders from several big airlines, including foreign carriers. The company’s stock still sells substantially below its net quick value per share. The stock of Republic Aviation, which also has orders for big transports pending, has held up well. Douglas firmed after declining several points from its recent high above 100.
Lockheed is reported to be reducing its personnel by more than 2.000, and has for the time being decided to stay out of the private plane field. Its
military backlogs remain large and those close to the company look for substantial earnings in 1946. Deliveries of Constellations are going ahead rapidly, and foreign -carriers continue to place orders.

C-I.T. Financial—-
Finance companies have been caught in the reconversion squeeze. They had planned for a substantial pick-up in instalment financing of new appliances and automobiles in the fourth quarter of last year. Then the strikes came, halting production and delivery of new consumer goods. Consequently, new financing was well below the volume anticipated for the last quarter of 1945. At the same time, expenses of many companies increased because of the opening of new branches and expansion in personnel. A case in point is C.I.T. Financial Corp Its annual report said that as a result of the sharp rise in expenses, notably in the last quarter, operations of instalment financing subsidiaries showed a loss in the second half of 1945. This was a factor in the parent’s decline in earnings to $1 61 a share from $2 10 for 1944. The report predicts, however, a substantial growth in instalment financing when production of consumer goods gets under way. Directors meet for dividend action tomorrow and it is expected that the usual quarterly dividend of 50 ct< ts a share will be declared.
Union Wire Rope—
Dividend payments by the Union Wire Rope C-nrp . traded over-the-counter, are scheduled to jump sharply in 1946 under a program now being carried out. Earnings of this big wire rope manufacturer have been two or three times the annual dividend payments in recent years. Recently the company paid a 100r<- stock dividend increasing the number of its shares to 208.0G0. It plans to give stockholders rights to subscribe to 42.000 more shares nt $15.50 a share and has announced that it plans to pay 80 cents a share on the capitalization of 250.000 shares, or an annual outlay of $200,000 It has been paying $104,000 a year.

Market View*—
Discussing the International Paper Co’s partial call of its $5 convertible preferred. Laidlaw A Co aaid: ‘’We expect the preferred to sell higher than the equivalent ol 21- shares c>f common (one share of preferred can be converted into 2‘y common) because of the long term value of the conversion feature of the preferred shares not called At the time of the call of 106.000 shares of the 925,966 shares of preferred, trading will be segregated into called and uncalled stock and the former undoubtedly will be priced under the uncalled shares. Thus those preferred holders not willing to run the risk of having their shares called should sell rather than convert.” • • • Buckley Brothers in asserting that they still ‘’like” the shares of American Rolling Mills, said production records were smashed in January at the five mills of this company, which employs 12.000 workers, while most of the industry was idle during the steel strike. Workers in the five plants arc represented by independent bargaining agents and negotis-tions on a new contract have been completed granting a pay advance ot 18’a cents an hour - • - Straus & Blosser of Chicago has issued analyses of General Bottlers. Inc . and Foote Brothers Gear & Machine Corp * * • Felix Juda of Sutro & Co.’s Los Angeles office: “At this stage of the market, we would not watch for those shares which have declined the most, but rather those issues which exhibited the greatest resistance. Such stocks in all likelihood, will be the leaders in the subsequent recovery.” • • • Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner A Beane, discussing the current controversy over the Government’s easy money policy, said: “To some people this sounds like another squabble between New Deal politicians and hide-bound Wall Street bankers. But they should take another look. It works this way. In order to maintain its easy money policy, the Government has put much of the debt into short term securities. Consequently 36*<? of the federal debt matures in the next year and another 20*7? within five years. Moreover, the Treasury follows a policy of paying off turing obligations in cash and reselling certificates.”

Aircrafl Manufacturing Stock*.............
The aircraft manufacturing atocka behaved relatively well during the soft market of the past week. One reason given is that thia industry has no price ceilings. When the war ended and the plane builders were anxious to go ahead with the development of private and commercial aircraft, they got a ruling from the O.P.A. exempting them from CeiiingB, mainly because most planes were new types and had little or no price precedent.
The result is that the industry’s manage* ment should be able tn make money for stockholders. Commercial backlogs arc

The Dow Chemical Co. reported for the six months ended September 30	1945 net
earnings of $2 49 a share, against $3 31 m the like 1944 uenod Profits before taxes dropped sharply to 59 million from $17 million but charges for the amortization of war plants were Jess, amounting to 52.8 million, against $4 million fn the year previous, and Federal tax reserves were $26 million as against $8 7 million.

engineering work for the Installation of a fifth paper machine and for the expansion of the bag facilities at Savannah. Ga. Alexander Calder, president, said that because of in-
creased demand for paper and board during the first half of this year there is likely to be a continued all-around shortage, and added that production of both pulp and paper probably will be adversely affected by a shortage of pulpwood, the production of which is being delayed by a lack of labor, trucks and other equipment. O.P.A. ceilings, according to Mr. Calder, have seriously affected the production of various grades of paper, and in view_ of the shortage of pulp and paper, he- said there is a strong likelihood that “higher prices will be requested on many paper products’*

Hunt Foods, Inc.—
Hunt Foods, Inc., as it prepares to absorb the dried fruit business of Guggenhime A Co., gives promise of giving the West Coast another major packing company. Since the consolidations in 1916 which formed California Packing Corp, there have been many attempts to organize another large packing concern on the West Coast. Although Hunt hasn't reached the stature of California Packing, it has in less than four years risen from a relatively modest position to a major one. The largest part of the growth has occurred in the past 12 months. After the Guggenhime acquisition. Hunt will have an annual uiles potential of between $35 million and $40 million. It is necessary to turn* to Cal-iack and Libbv, McNeill & Libby for larger volumes in the far western packing field. Calpack sold $111 'million of foods in the fiscal year ended February 28, 1945. Gug-genhime’s stockholders meet today to vote on the proposal to sell the dried fruit business to Hunt. As the company is closely held, the meeting is considered a formality. Hunt is ready to buy. The pnee to be paid or manner of financing has not been disclosed. Gug-yenhime’s last indicated net worth was upward of $1 5 million.
Hunt’s management is considering several means of raising cash for the purchase. One possibility is that an adjustment of the 6’r preferred stock, known to have been under consideration, may be coupled with new money financing. Hunt has outstanding 3.726 shares of 7% preferred. S2.S80 shares of $10 par 6% preferred. 97,390 shares of 510 par 5% preference stock and 323.238 shares of $6 66 1/3 par common The 6% preferred is callable on any dividend date at $10.25 a share. Guggenhime. after today’s meeting, is expected to call at $105 the 7'?, retire the issue of 6f'r preference stock and liquidate. Hunt Foods report for the nine months ended November 30. 1915. showing a net of 5456.000. or $1 85 a common share, does not reflect its true earnings prospects since California Conserving Co. has been added since that time.
