The three-day uptrend in the stock market was broken at the start of the new week, the general list easing off in a dull session. Losses in pivotal stocks were confined mostly to 3 points or less. The bond market was irregular, but second-grade railroad issues suffered. Wheat was strong much of the session, and at one time the major cereal showed an advance of more than 1 cent a bushel. At the close, however, it was up only a quarter of a cent. Cotton moved lower, and closed down 12 to 15 points, influenced by Wall Street selling, on the reaction in stocks, and light hedge sales.
Stocks had to contend with several adverse developments. Omission of the usual extra payment by Coca Cola was one of them. Another was the Atchison loadings report for the week ended November 12, which showed a rather heavy drop from the previous week. The third was the closing of six banks, four small ones in Oklahoma, a small institution m Wisconsin, and one of medium size in Pittsburgh.
As an offset to the adverse news, two of the commodity price indices showed an improvement, and the steel reviews showed io change in the output rate, which is holding at around 21%. Seasonally, a decline is due at this time.
Union Pacific Opens Off
Wall Street's expectation of a strong opening in stocks was not fulfilled. The list opened dull and lower, with some issues recording sharp declines. Union Pacific, for instance, started at 73, off 3; Steel common at 38*4, off 1; Allied Chemical, at 80’.*. off 1’2, and Telephone, at 111 $4, off five-eighths.
Declines were extended in the first 15 minutes, and then the list steadied. Rising wheat prices generated some enthusiasm for stocks, and through the morning the market rallied. Announcement ot the omission of the Coca Cola extra payment brought pressure on the list, and stocks dipped. Coca Cola broke sharply and got down as low as 84. where it was down	points. It closed off 6“>,-
A mild recovery took place from the lows at the start of the final hour, but it was short-lived, and the day’s close found stocks not far above their bottom prices. Union Pacific, Case and American Tobacco B were off more than most active issues, all dropping over 3 points. Central Railroad of New Jersey, always a wide mover, sagged 71- to 62’- on one transaction.
Abroad, the markets were lower. In London stocks and British funds sagged. In Paris, a late recovery movement failed to wipe out earlier losses.
Oil Executives Meet
Interest m the oil industry at the moment has shifted to Texas. The outstanding development, of course, is the signing of the oil and gas conservation bill by Governor Sterling, containing a clause which provides that market demand be considered when fixing proration. In addition, oil executives have gathered m Houston for the annual session of the American Petroleum Institute.
Coal Stocks Lowest Since 1922
The Bureau of Mines estimate on soft coal stocks in the hands of consumers on October 1 was surprisingly favorable, for it showed that stocks were the lowest since 1922, considering the season of the year. Stocks in consumers’ hands were down 20.3% from a year ago. and coal on lake docks was off 20 5% from October 1. 1931.
Even taking into consideration the present low rate of consumption, the statistics were favorable, compared with a year ago. Consumers’ stocks on hand arc sufficient to last 38 days, while stocks last year were enough for 39 days.
Compared with July 1, stocks were up 1,200,000 tons, but this was much less than customary. Last year, for example, stocks moved up 4,400,000 tons in the third quarter, as consumers built up reserves in anticipation of the heating load.
Commodity Index Up Slightly
After eight weeks of uninterrupted declines, Fisher’s index of commodity prices has scored an advance. Even though small, the advance was encouraging, for it broke a trend that had proved disheartening.
The index hit its high on September 9, reaching 63.2. The downward movement carried it from that level to 60.2 in the week ended No-vembet 4, only a little above the mid-June low. In the week ended November 11, the index reached 60.3. a gain of a tenth of a point.
The advance of commodity prices was one of the prime factors that pushed the stock market ahead in the sharp upswing from early July until early September. The upward move in commodities started before the stock move, but both ended at just about the same time. A sustained improvement in commodity prices now would be all to the good for those constructively inclined toward the securities markets.
Waterways
The sub-committee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began yesterday consideration of the St. Lawrence Waterway Treaty. Opposition to the waterway is, of course, strong from the railroads, and their arguments against it points out the tremendous sums necessary for the development and the hardly favorable traffic outlook.
The president of one of the eastern trunk lines declared recently that competition from the waterway would be serious for the carriers, particularly from a seasonal standpoint. He declared that in the winter months, navigation over the waterway would be practically impossible, and the railroads would havp to handle
what traffic there was. To do this, they would be forced to maintain fully lines over which such traffic would move. In spring, summer and early fall, the waterway would be in operation, and would divert traffic from the rails in sufficient volume to cut down their revenues fairly substantially.
The government’s policy toward the railroads and the inland waterways puts it in an extraordinary position. On the one hand, the Government is supporting the railroads with government funds, to keep them from receivership, and on the other it is planning to sink money into inland waterways, to say nothing of barge lines, to increase competition ■with the -very railroads it is trying to save from receivership.
Chesapeake & Ohio
Directors of the Chesapeake & Ohio and the Chesapeake Corp, meet for dividend action in Cleveland today, and it is highly unlikely there will be any change in the current dividend rates being paid by both companies. After the meeting, the .October report of the C. & O. is scheduled to be made public. It should show that the C. & O. had net income for the month, equal to about 54 cents a share on the common stock. Such a showing would bring net for the 10 months of this year up to the equivalent of about $2.55 a share on the common, or 5 cents a share more than the annual common dividend requirements.
The management now feels that C. & O. will wind up 1932 with net income equal to about $2.85 a share on the common stock. The last instalment of $750,000 on the road’s bank loan of $2,500,000, incurred last spring, is due shortly, and will be paid.
High and Low Prices
Monday, on the New York Stock Exchange, three stocks (Duquesne Light 5% first pfd.. Freeport Texas and Thatcher Mfg.» made new highs, and one stock (City Stores ctfs.) made a new low, for the year 1931.
