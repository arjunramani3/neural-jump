stock aver-
The recognized leaders of the market. Steel, Telephone and American Can. pushed forward in the late trading: yesterday to lead the market into new high ground on the recovery movement. The late buying carried Telephone to 112%, up 4% points from Thursday’s closing level and almost 9 points from Wednesday’s final price. Steel common finished at 39*?*. up l3* on the day. Gains throughout the stock list ran from a point to around 5, and the close was near the day’s highs.
The bond market maintained its Improved tone. Rail obligations led the list upward, but there were advances elsewhere. The grain markets were closed for the Armistice Day holiday, but the buoyant tone m cotton persisted. Cotton closed up $1 a bale.
The day’s news was not so Important a factor as on Thursday, but it aided in generating interest in the market. • The St. Paul estimated net railway operating income for October at about 20% ahead of October, 1931. The estimate was regarded as indicative of the favorable reports for the month to be issued by a number of carriers. The reports will start appearing in volume within two weeks.
Reports that miscellaneous buyers, who had been out of the market recently, again were placing orders for steel was a factor in the late run-up.	c
Oil stocks were benefitted by the action of the Texas legislature in amending the state’s laws covering oil conservation in accordance with the recent court decision.
Overnight Changes Small
Overnight changes in the market were slight. Telephone, for instance, started off unchanged at 107%; Steel common, at 38%, was up a 2^. and Atchison at 44% was up only % There was heavy buying in the market, and big blacks of stocks changed hands in the first 15 minutes The increased trading activity brought rising prices, but the market eased slightly later.	’
By iioon, stocks were up substantially, particularly the pivotal rails. Union Pacific and Atchison, Chesapeake & Ohio and Southern Pacific were in the van of the advance. The list sagged off in the early afternoon, but in the final few minutes of trading, it surged forward again Union Pacific closed at 74%, the day’s high, and up 4%. Westinghouse, at 31%, was up 3%.
The “beer” stocks were neglected, and dropped off. Owens Illinois Glass, the favorite, was down 1%, and Crown Cork lost %.
Volume of trading for the day reached 2,600.000 shares, against 1.600,000 shares Thursday One transaction which caused comment was a block of 12,700 shares of General Foods at 27% The stock closed at 28%, up fractionally.
At the close the Dow-Jones industrial average stood at 6S.03, more than 2 points above the level at the close on October 19, the previous high of the trading range which has prevailed since October 10 The rail average, at 30.58, was almost a full point through the trading range high, set October 20.
Markets abroad were higher. Prices soared in Milan, and in London, the market was firm.
in the form of loans of “federal funds” to banks rather than loans to business. However, such “federal fund” loans tend to ease the general government securities; they enlarged their portfolios by $21,000,000 last week to $2,255,000,000. a new high for the year. They also bought $9,000,000 of non-govemment securities.
The extremely liquid position of New York banks is striking. More than 46%% of their demand deposits are in United States government securities. All deposit liabilities plus “due to banks” amount to $8,019,000,000. Against these quick liabilities, the banks have $3,850,000,000 in immediately liquid assets, or slightly over 48%.
The condition of the Reserve banks showed some large changes which were chiefly due to influences in connection with Election Day. The currency circulation rose $35,000,000, which is not unusual for this week in years of a Presidential election. There was a rise in the average daily volume of circulation in the similar week of 1928 of $31,000,000, and of $49,000,000 in the like week of 1924.
The $42,000,000 decline in member bank reserve balances was accounted for chiefly by New York City banks, which bad a drop of $37,000,000. New York banks apparently are putting more of their excess reserves to work. Two weeks ago excess reserves were $316,000,000, whereas on November 9 they were only $230,000,000 in New York. Total borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank dropped $15,000,000 to $311,000,00, the lowest level since September 23, 1931.
The Beer Return Problem
The jubilation over the “wet” landslide, precipitating the rally in the “beer” stocks, is tempered in informed quarters by the knowledge of the steps which must be taken before beer can be brought back and the legal problems involved.
The first move, of course, is for Congress to repeal the Volstead enforcement act and pass a measure legalizing the manufacture and sale of light wines and beer. With such a measure passed, the way would be partly clear for the return of beer and wines, but court action seems a likelihood.
The Eighteenth Amendment prohibits the “manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors” within the country, or their importation. The Supreme Court, if the die-hard drys fight, will be called on to interpret this section of the amendment and its relationship to beer and wines.
Action on repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment itself, which would clear the road for the return of liquor, will take considerable time, for it involves both congressional and state legislative or convention sanction.

«Tust a Minor Error
‘The Minister of Finance of the Argentine issued a statement on the government’s floating debt on October 31 which caused considerable interest, as well as wonder, in Wall Street. On the government’s books the floating debt showed a reduction of about 30%, amounting in. dollars to $97,225,400, from the total at the start of the year. Commenting on the reduction, the Finance Minister asserted that he could find no reason for it, and that it must be due to errors m accounting.
Surcharges and the R. C. C.
The railroads want the surcharges retained, but they want the Railroad Credit Corp, abandoned, and they plan to submit these proposals shortly to the Interstate Commerce Commission. It is a pretty knotty problem for the commission to act on, for the surcharges were granted, definitely, as an emergency measure, and for the sole purpose of raising money to help save indigent carriers from receivership. Before the commission approved the surcharge proposal, it rejected the roads’ application for a flat 1 5% increase in rates
A number of the big roads have been very dissatisfied with the Railroad Credit Corp. They have felt that they would get back only a portion of the funds they contributed to it, and a good many railroad presidents are of the opinion that some of the roads saved from receivership should have been permitted to undergo reorganizations.
The big carriers, however, do not want to lose the revenues they have received from the surcharges. For individual roads they have amounted to a great deal. Chesapeake & Ohio, for instance, will receive close to $2,400,000 from the surcharges this year, or better than 30 cents a share on the road’s common stock, and Pennsylvania, New York Central and a few others will receive even more
The whole question revolves around whether the commission will hold to Its previous position that the surcharges were an emergency measure to raise money for poverty stricken roads, or will revise its stand.
Bank Statements
New York City banks increased their loans and investments $46,000,000 last week to the highest level of the year, and over $750,000,000 above the low point. The feature was a rise of $22,000,000 in “all other loans” to $1,850,000,000, which is $94,000,000 above the year’s low point. Part of this lending was probably
