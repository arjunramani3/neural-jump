The stock market declined sharply yesterday across a broad front after an afternoon try at a rally fizzled. Trading was moderately active.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 641.74, off 12.98 points. The transportation and utility indicators finished somewhat lower.
Gold stocks continued to act as a drag on the market (see below).
Homestake Mining, most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at 33%, off 2%, on volume of 525,100 shares. Among other Big Board actives, ASA Ltd. ended at 57%, down 7 points; and Campbell Red Lake Mines finished at 23%, down 1% points.
Robert Stovall, vice president and director of investments for Reynolds Securities, said gold stocks historically perform badly near the end of a bear market. “Investors feel gold offers a much better hedge against inflation than deflation; and, if we’re moving into a recession and a period of deflation, they may have decided it’s time to unload,” he commented Mr Stovall also noted that pension funds have been putting pressure on their investment managers to liquidate the funds' stock holdings and put proceeds into higher-yielding investments.
After falling about 15 points by 2 p.m. yesterday, the industrial average rebounded slightly and then dug in until the close. “Until that rally occurred, it looked like the market was falling down a bottomless pit,” commented John Smith, analyst with Fahnestock & Co.
Mr. Smith and some other analysts said they were waiting to see whether the market could hold at its current level and build up momentum for a major rally. Alan Poole, analyst with Laidlaw-Coggeshall Inc., noted other market indexes recently dipped below their 1970 lows. “This has bearish connotations, but it doesn't necessarily mean the market is about to begin another downward cycle—unless the industrial average also falls through its 1970 low” of 631.16 reached May 26.
Big Board volume yesterday rose to 16,920,000 shares from Wednesday's 11,820,000. Yesterday was one of the most active trading days in the past two months. On Sept. 4, Big Board turnover was 16,932,240 shares, the biggest since 17,768,830 shares were traded July 12.
Indicative of the scope of the market’s retreat, declining issues led advances by about three to one at the outset. The gap widened steadily during the day and, at the final bell, declines led advances, 1,274 to 182. Stocks dropping to new 1974 lows surged to 586 from Wednesday’s 333. There weren’t any issues that touched 1974 highs yesterday. The day before, only three stocks reached new 1974 highs.
The American Stock Exchange index also fell, closing at 64.06, off 1.47. Declines led advances by more than four to one Volume rose to 2,370,000 shares from Wednesday’s 1,670,000.
The National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ index of over-the-counter stocks dropped 1.25 points to close at 57.71.
If the market yesterday was looking for encouraging news that might help stimulate a rally, it didn't get it. In Atlanta, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, predicted a “worsening of the outlook" for the nation’s economy through next spring, and a continuing increase in prices. In Washington, federal officials reported that August’s wholesale prices rose a seasonally adjusted 3.9%, or an explosive annual rate of 46.8%; and interest rates on home mortgages continued to climb sharply last month. In addition, ministers of the major oil-exporting nations, meeting in Vienna, discussed whether to raise oil prices again and some Arab ministers reportedly planned to discuss whether to resume the oil embargo.
Yesterday, the New York Stock Exchange board of directors approved a
