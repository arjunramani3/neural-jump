Industrials Skid 29.05, Steepest Drop in 11 Years; Action Is Termed ’Panic’ Over Energy Crisis
By Victor J. Hiujm
Concern over the energy crisis sent stock prices reeling yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average had its biggest tumble in more than 11 years and its filth largest in history. Trading was fairlv active.
Brokers said President Nixon’s Sunday night speech, in which he asked that gasoline sales be banned on Sundays, was gloomier than some had expected
The industrial average plunged 29 05 points to 824.95, its lowest level since it finished at 816.59 on Nov. 26, 1971. The decline was the sharpest since the 34,95 points of May 28, 1962. In the past four weeks the indicator has racked up a staggering loss of 162.11 points.
Describing yesterday’s action as “the utmost panic,” Leslie M. Pollack, senior vice president of Hayden Stone Inc., said it resulted from an accumulation of investor fears about the impact of the energy shortage on next year’s economy. And Newton D. Zinder, vice president of E. F. Hutton & Co. said the shortage “is a peacetime occurrence that’s unique and no one knows how to assess it.”
The industrial average yesterday began with a loss of about 13 points. After slipping almost all session, it was down 32.58 points at 2:30 p in. It rebounded a bit in the final hour. A sharp loss also was sustained by the transportation average. And the utility index, falling 1.50 to 89.63, hit its lowest level since it finished at 89.55 on June 6, 1960.
The damage was widespread. This was underscored by the 1,518 New York Stock Exchange losers, which exceeded the 149 gainers by more than 10-to-one. A huge pile of 432 stocks bumped new 1973 lows, compared with 118 on Friday: only two issues again reached new highs.
Big Board volume, heaviest during the initial hour and the final 30 minutes, amounted to 19,830,000 shares, up from 11,470,000 on Friday, a day that fell between Thanksgiving and the weekend.
“Baseless Speculation” Cited
Sunday, President Nixon issued his first round of orders designed to forestall a predicted 10% to 17% shortage of petroleum products. Also, Charles J. DiBona. deputy director of the White House Energy Policy Office, commented that Wall Street appears to be gyrating on "baseless speculation” about the energy situation. He said “there is much scare-talk when there should be more accurate information and greater understanding.”
Other factors that also took tlieir toll in yesterday’s market were the increase by the First National Bank of Chicago in its prime, or basic lending, rate, to 9%% from 9’i% and a statement by a group of leading economists that energy problems could severely damage the nation's growth in 1974.
Part of the slump also was ascribed to some distress selling to satisfy margin-maintenance calls. Margin is the amount of cash a customer must keep on deposit with a broker under Big Board rules.
Institutional activity wasn’t at an exceptionally high level yesterday, as was indicated by the 86 trades of 10,000 shares or more, up from 72 Friday.
American Stock Exchange losers outdistanced winners by about eight-to-one; its index slipped 2.82 to 93.67. Turnover quickened to 3,980,000 shares from 2,040,000 the prior session. A 3.17-point loss was sustained by the National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter stocks, which ended at 94.13.
In the over-the-counter bond market, prime corporates fell about % to •% point but long-term governments rose as much as 12-32 point.
Again in the van of the retreat were the oil, auto, chemical and computer stocks. They were joined by defense, airline, housing, copper, drug, electronic, movie, paper, television, rubber, steel, tobacco and savings-and-loan issues. Some of the golds, however, sported gains.
Auto stocks again were depressed by fears of the effects of fuel restrictions. General Motors, the second most active issue, fell 2% to 49%; late last week, the company said it will close, totally or partially, 16 of its 24 North
