The S&P 500, like the volatile Nasdaq Composite Index, now once again is down more than 20% from its most recent closing high on Jan. 4. By Wall Street's rule of thumb, that puts both the Nasdaq and the S&P into bear markets -- reflecting a broad sense of frustration among investors.
Tech stocks for once were less affected, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.5%, or 35.11 points, to 1346.01. The Nasdaq, dominated by big tech stocks, now is down 31% this year. It has lost 73% of its value since hitting a record close in March 2000. The Dow industrials are 25% off their record close, while the S&P 500 is 40% below its record, both of those also hit in 2000.
Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 2.37%, or 2.93 points, to 120.58. In major U.S. market action:

WANING CONFIDENCE in the stock market and in corporate integrity helped drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 3%, and sent the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its lowest point in more than four years.
The S&P 500, like the volatile Nasdaq Composite Index, now once again is down more than 20% from its most recent closing high on Jan. 4. By Wall Street's rule of thumb, that puts both the Nasdaq and the S&P into bear markets -- reflecting a broad sense of frustration among investors.
"This is a classic bear market," where the stock market falls more under the weight of investor disaffection than because of specific news, said E. Matthew Brown, head of stock management at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Del.
The Dow industrials aren't yet down 20% from their recent high, though yesterday's fall was the steepest for that index since late September. Treasury bonds again soared as investors sought their relative safety, and Friday's fleeting stock surge became just a memory.
Traders trying to explain the drop pointed to a number of specific news events: the announcement from Denver phone giant Qwest Communications International that it is under federal criminal investigation, a big shift in the makeup of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and Merck's decision to pull plans for its benefits unit, Medco, to begin trading as a separate company.
But Keith Gertsen, head of Nasdaq trading at brokerage firm Deutsche Bank Securities, said none of those really captured investors' attention during the day. The problem, he said, is a "systemic" loss of confidence that is causing individuals and pros alike to move some money out of stocks and wait for the crisis to pass.
"The credibility issues, or lack of credibility, and lack of confidence are just driving things," Mr. Gertsen said. The most immediate problem, he said, was disappointment that President Bush's speech on cleaning up corporate fraud didn't offer investors a clearer map about "what is going to be done to correct it. People are asking, 'What is the duration on that? How long will it take to turn that around?' "
With no answers in the offing, the Dow industrials slid 3.1%, or 282.59 points, to 8813.50, now down 12% so far this year. The S&P 500 fell 3.4%, or 32.36 points, to 920.47, down 20% this year.
Tech stocks for once were less affected, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.5%, or 35.11 points, to 1346.01. The Nasdaq, dominated by big tech stocks, now is down 31% this year. It has lost 73% of its value since hitting a record close in March 2000. The Dow industrials are 25% off their record close, while the S&P 500 is 40% below its record, both of those also hit in 2000.
The dollar managed to stop its decline against the euro for a day, although it continued to fall against the yen.
Some traders said they saw signs that investors in mutual funds were redeeming some of their holdings, and that some of the funds were selling shares in response.
In addition, the broad shift in the S&P 500, involving the elimination of foreign-based companies from the index, created sharp shifts in the affected companies' share prices and helped push overall volume well above average. Traders said the volatility might have hurt stocks.
On top of that, "Foreign money is continuing to exit our market," said Robert Morris, chief investment officer at the Jersey City, N.J., fund-management group Lord Abbett. "When you take the market losses together with the currency losses, it makes their jaws drop."
But, "In some ways this is healthy," Mr. Morris added. For stocks to begin lasting gains, he said, investors who are losing faith in the stock market need to "capitulate," or give up on their stocks. As long as people are holding stock that they hope to sell when its price goes up, those people serve as brakes on the market, selling stock every time there is a rally.
"We have had capitulations in the past and I've lived through them, and this certainly smells like one," Mr. Morris said, since stocks appear to be falling much harder in
recent days than the actual news would seem to explain. Mr. Morris is hoping that stocks could turn up again once second-quarter earnings reports start to come in over
the next few days.

Blue Chips Fall 3%, S&P 500 Hits 4-Year Low - ProQuest
Not all the day's news was bad. One reason the Nasdaq composite didn't fall farther is that Nasdaq giant Cisco Systems benefited from Merrill Lynch's upgrade to "strong
buy," and jumped almost 3% on the day.
But General Motors and Ford dropped as Banc of America Securities downgraded them on fears that mounting competition on warranties with DaimlerChrysler could hurt profits. And news broke that Vice President Dick Cheney and the company he once headed, oil-services concern Halliburton, were sued by a watchdog group alleging that management overstated revenue.
Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 2.37%, or 2.93 points, to 120.58. In major U.S. market action:
Stocks retreated. On the Big Board, where 1.79 billion shares traded, 798 stocks rose and 2,427 fell.
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 21/32, or $6.56 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.630%. The 30-year bond was up 31/32 to yield 5.342%.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 117.69 yen, down from 117.89, while the euro fell against the dollar to 98.91 cents from 99.45.
