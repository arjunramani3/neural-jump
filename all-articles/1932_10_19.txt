Firmness in stocks was pronounced out yesterday’s session, and in the last hour of trading- the general list rallied, with pivotal stocks up 3 points or more. The bond market was quiet, with a strong undertone, rail issues turning about in a narrow range, with changes small. Wheat finished the day up close to a cent a bushel, and cotton advanced 9 to 14 points.
The opening in stocks was not exciting, overnight changes mostly being confined to fractions. Telephone was up a quarter. Steel common an eighth. Allied Chemical started unchanged. Overnight news, in the shape of quarterly reports, was not an. influence marketwise, the electricals, Westinghouse and General Electric, working higher in the face of the poor reports. Quiet demand for the rails continued, with the leaders like New York Central, Union Pacific, Atchison, and Delaware, Lackawanna & Western, moving higher.
Trading in the morning was listless, and stocks eased generally around noon. Continental Can was a strong spot among the industrials, and the rails held steady in the face of the mild recessions elsewhere in the list. Telephone got as low as 104%, and Steel sold down to 37. During the final hour, the list rallied in brisker trading, with Telephone reaching close to 109. up almost 5 points from the earlier low, arid Steel 39. The close was Just under the day’s highs.
Roosevelt’s Tariff Stand Like Hoover's
Strength in■ the market appeared following Governor Roosevelt’s speech which included a discussion of the tariff. The Roosevelt position, as expounded in yesterday’s speech, seems to be almost identical with that of President Hoover.
The rails drew strength from the individual carloading reports, including those of Central and Pennsylvania, recording a continuance of the improved traffic trend.
Dividend news was favorable, Liggett & Myers and National Biscuit voting the regulag, payments. Word from the steel centers, however, indicated nn easing of operations. Youngstown’s rate, at the mid-week, was down to 18% of capacity, against 20% at the start of the week and 19% a week previous. Scrap prices at Youngstown show a narrow decline.
Stocks were irregular in London, mining shares ruling higher. In Paris, the Bourse was -weak.
rather significant to note that in 1928 when business certainly had a sharp fall pickup. Central’s loadings gain between mid-July and midOctober was only about 25%, or a shade less than the upswing than has taken place this Fall. This year's upturn has taken place in the face of steadily declining automobile production, one of the sinews of rail traffic, in 1928 motor production in August and September scored wide gains over July.
Central’s loadings and those at other carriers for the October 15 week indicate that traffic for the country as a whole for that week will show an advance over the October 8 week, counter to the seasonal trend.

High and Low Prices
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange two stocks made new highs. General Mills, cumulative preferred and Owens I. Glass, and none made new lows for the year 1932.
The Third Quarter Reports
So far. the third quarter reports have not proved as unpalatable as Wall Street was anticipating two weeks ago. and the market has not been depressed by their appearance. The General Electric and Westinghouse statements were hardly conducive to enthusiasm, but statements of other major companies were better than expected In many quarters.
As a group, the railroads will make an excellent showing, in comparison with the drab reports that have come to hand for months. The Union Pacific and Chesapeake & Ohio reports for September give some indication of what the general run of carrier reports will show. The Nickel Plate’s operating income for September was ahead of September. 1931.
Continental Can, Penick & Ford, Corn Products. Texas Gulf and du Pont turned in statements better than the Street was looking for. The report that Wall Street is awaiting is that of the United States Steel Corp., to be made public next Tuesday when action on the preferred dividend is taken. Wall Street cun expect nothing except a poor showing, in view of the low rate of op+ations during the quarter.
Incidentally, Westinghouse early in yesterday’s trading was strong in the face of the earnings report. The stock opened at 28% on a block ot 1,500 shares, up five-eighths, and moved ahead easily to above 29.	'
A Comparison in Canners
Continental Can Co. has fared somewhat better this year than the American Can Co. Last year. Continental reported net equal to 83.27 a share on the capital stock, and estimates put this year’s net at somewhat better than $2.58 a share. Net for 1932 in all probability will be around 16% below net for 1831. •
American Can reported net equal to $5.11 a share for 1931, and estimates this year’s net at roughly $3.25 a share, down around 34%. Continental is covering its $2 dividend rate by a substantial margin, whereas American Can's net apparently will fall 75 cents a share under the present $4 dividend rate. Continental has no preferred stock, and has a relatively better cash position. A few years ago. American was, stronger in cash, but plant expansion took -a large part of it in recent years.
Central's Traffic Pick-Up
Since mid-July, New York Central has had a pick-up in traffic which has put an entirely new complexion on the status of the road. The upturn is in striking contrast to what took place in the similar period of 1931.
For the week ended July 16 New York Central Lines loadings totaled 33,884 cars, against 53,088 cars in the similar week of 1931. For the week ended October 15, Central's loadings were 42,655 cars, against 49,230 cars in the like week of 1981. This year, the October 15 loadings were 8,791 cars, or a little better than 26%, ahead of those of the mid-July week. In 1931 October 15 loadings were about 7% below the mid-July week’s total.
A rise in traffic, of course, is normal in the period covered. It is a seasonal development, with loadings advancing as business moves forward out of the summer doldrums. But it is
