Support for high grade stocks gave way badly in Thursday’s market and the Dow-Jones industrial average dropped through its December closing low level of 118.93, losing 4.57 points on the day. Rails and utilities went to new low ground, the former losing 0.89 points and the latter 0.91 points. Bond prices also were weak and commodities followed an irregular course.
Sentiment was badly upset bv the abrupt decline in American Telephone, that stock plunging more than seven points. However, while that issue was the most conspicuous there were numerous others that lost as much percentagewise and thinness of oids was the order of the day. With volume of craning expanded to 1,090,000 shares, against 580,000 shares on the preceding day, the market was in difficulties most of the time. There were few rallying efforts, the most notable one occurring in the last hour, but this movement failed to follow through, and prices finished near the bottom.
Allied Chemical, du Font, Westinghouse Electric, Sears, Roebuck, U. S. Steel and Bethlehem were among the more depressed issues. Steels were down from the start, the break in Youngstown Sheet & Tube just at the close of Wednesday's session bringing selling into other issues in this industry.
Union Pacific, Atchison, .New York Central, Southern Pacific and other carrier shares were depressed, some setting up new lows. Consolidated Edison's spell of firmness after the regular dividend was short-Jived, that issue dropping back again. Public Service of New Jersey dropped near its old low.
TECHNICAL ACTION—
Technically, the action of the Dow-Jones industrial average in dropping under the December low was considered a discouraging sign. While the industrials are still above the November levels, many students of the averages are inclined to put more weight on the December figure, considering that support should have been encountered there if the makings of an intermediate uptrend were present. Many in. dividual industrials within that average broke through significant support levels after months of practically sidewise movements in "a broad trading range. For the rails and utilities, It is questionable whether the movements of recent months can be termed sidewise for they have been establishing successively lower bottoms since late last year.

AMERICAN TELEPHONE—
Chartists had an explanation for the pronounced weakness in American Telephone. Around the 140 level, the stock had formed a triple bottom, having reached that approximate point before, once in October and again in December. Once through this point, jo the chart analysis runs, the resistance was bound to be of a poorer grade for a time, fact which the thinness of bids seems to substantiate.
American Telephone had been holding up comparatively well, moving in a sidewise direction for the past three months along with several other high-grade common shares. With some fairly good bonds weakening, poorer

PRICE POLICIES—
Having been special economic adviser to the British government, and to the New Deal m its early days Professor O. M. W. Sprague's opinions on business policies arc particularly in. teresting. Addressing the New York Economic Club Wednesday night. Professor Sprague, who is noted for his conservative and orthodox viewpoints. turned highly critical of capital goods industries for attempting to maintain prices at this time. They should reduce prices regardless of what labor does or does not do, he contends, and trust to their ability to bring labor around
to the viewpoint of working for a lower wage rate.
“If this (maintaining prices) were a good policy from the point of view of profits, I might be impressed,** he said, “since X am connected with an Investment trust, but I do not observe it as good for profit.** He was particularly critical of the steel industry, contending that its profit record over a long period of years had not been a good one and this he attributed to its merchandising policies.

COMMODITIES AND INVENTORIES—
Action of several commodities has been a brake on bullishness. Hides and copper have been weak and rubber has not been able to respond with sustained rallies despite drastic curtailment in export quotas by the Anglo-Dutch interests. Other commodities have been sluggish.
Dragging action of commodities seems to be due to tbe fact that while Inventories of finished goods in retail hands have been brought down sharply, there are still some sizable amounts of raw materials around in primary and secondary hands. This is particularly true of textiles. In the steel industry, semi-finished steel inventories are down 7%% against a year ago but iron ore on docks or at blast furnaces is 30% larger and pig iron 65% higher. Non-ferrous metal inventories increased 40% in the steel industry during 1937.
The trouble is that these primary producers have not had a good opportunity to reduce their raw material supplies, due to the falling away in demand. However, should artificial, government-sponsored additions be made to purchasing power of the public, the inventory situation might change overnight. It is the recession m demand that has left stocks high and dry.
• * •
RETAIL TRADE—
Merchandising issues have been giving some ground on reports that retail trade has been slackening some after showing good resistance for a while. In several of the large eastern cities, retail trade dropped off late in January after holding close to last year’s levels earlier in the month.
Sears Roebuck showed a loss of 3.1% in sales against a year ago for the four weeks ended January* 29. Neisner Bros, showed a recession of 4.5% for the month, against a December increase of 2%, Neither of these reports are particularly bad considering the differences in business conditions between the two periods, but while the downtrend is in progress it is difficult to generate bullish sentiment.
