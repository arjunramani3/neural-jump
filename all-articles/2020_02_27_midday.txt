Dow Industrials On Pace For Correction as
Virus Fears Show No Signs of Easing
Stocks, U.S.Treasury yields slide on investors' anxiety about economic growth

Global stocks, U.S. government-bond yields and oil prices tumbled Thursday, extending losses
as investors braced for a drop in business activity and corporate earnings following the spread
of the coronavirus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.3%, or 914 points, to 26040. The S&P 500 dropped 3.2%,
and the Nasdaq Composite shed 4%, putting all three indexes on track to close about 10% below
their February highs, a decline known as a correction.
Markets have shown increasing pessimism this week about the potential economic impact as
the virus emerges in new locations. Some U.S. companies say they could lose as much as half
their annual revenue from China if the coronavirus epidemic extends through the summer.
American businesses will generate no earnings growth in 2020 if the virus becomes
widespread, Goldman Sachs Group's equity analysts warned on Thursday.
CORONAVIRUS ANDTHE MARKETS
Register here for a conference call Friday at noon EST with Wall Street Journal editors and
reporters on how global markets are reacting to the latest virus news.
"We have to brace ourselves for wave after wave of earnings downgrades,” said Paul O'Connor,
head of multi asset at Janus Henderson Investors. "The globalization of the virus extinguishes
confidence in the V-shaped recovery that was the view last week.”

European indexes also dropped, with the Stoxx Europe 600 tumbling 4%. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei
225 closed 2.1% lower, while South Korea’s Kospi declined 1%.
Investors continued to seek out the safety of government-bond holdings. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury, which closed at a record 1.310% on Wednesday, dropped to
1.256% Thursday, according to Tradeweb. Yields move inversely to bond prices.
A key measure of turbulence in U.S. stocks also rose Thursday, with the Cboe Volatility Index, or
VIX, jumping to 31.64, its highest level since December 2018. The options-based gauge tends to
rise when markets fall and investors reach for insurance-like contracts to protect their
portfolios.
“The global fear factor has become stronger due to the warnings coming out from the U.S.,” said
Song Seng Wun of CIMB Private Banking in Singapore. “And as recession risks grow, the
markets have become more jittery.”
Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 4% to $50.67 a barrel, reflecting anxiety about the
demand for energy if growth prospects sour. Gold, considered a haven asset during times of
turmoil in markets, rose 0.9%.
More than 82,000 people have been infected by the virus and the death toll stands at more than
2,800 globally. On Wednesday, American authorities said a patient in California might be the
first U.S. coronavirus case to be diagnosed without a clear explanation for how the disease was
transmitted.
“Everyone is now trying to assess what the economic impact will be,” said Neil Dwane, global
strategist at Allianz Global Investors. “The U.S. is looking at Europe and Japan as evidence of
how the world is responding.”
