than carload lot traffic in the February 18 week. It was the improvement in these two classifications of freight that made possible the upturn in tvaffle?, for coal loadings showed a drop of more than 9,000 cars from the previous week. A large movement of grain contributed to the betterment, but the gain was not so conspicuous as in the small freight classifications.
The figures appearing next Saturday will be most important, as they will cover a week in which the effects of the Michigan banking holiday were beginning to be felt.

Stocks and bonds declined steeply in the short closing session of the week, practically all groups reaching new lows for the reaction. Transactions ran to 990,000 shares, the largest for any two-hour session since October 8.
Weakness in Government bonds was the feature of the bond market, and the break there preceded the drastic declines la other securities. Most of the ground gained in the previous session was lost, and declines ran from 2-32nds to 29-32nds. All grades of domestic corporation issues were swept lower in the new selling wave. Commodities sank, cotton losing about $1 a bale and wheat around 1 cent a bushel.
The Maryland bank holiday was an overnight development. The market opened heavy, and gave way easily under insistent selling in the first hour. Prices steadied for a brief period, and then turned downward once more, with trading picking up sharply. Some short covering near the finish was sufficient to enable the list to close slightly above the days’ lows.

Some News Cheering
Not all the news was bad. In Indiana, two banks, recently closed under a moratorium, reopened, following enactment of new banking legislation. It was the first important rift in the banking clouds, and under different circumstances might have received the attention it merited.
The carloadings report showed that traffic in the February 18 week had recorded another sizable upturn, but this failed to provoke any interest in carrier shares. Delaware & Hudson, among active stocks, showed the largest loss, dropping 6 points.^ Union Pacific and Atchison were heavy throughout the session.
In the late trading, United Aircraft broke badly. The stock opened at 20 and met persistent selling. It dipped badly in the last hour, touching a low of 16 before it rallied to close at 17^3, off 3%. The sharp decline in the stock was accompanied by reports of the dissolution of a group which had been working on the constructive side.
Kall Average Under October 10 Low
The Dow-Jones average of 20 railroad stocks at the close stood at 23.43, less than a full point under the October 10 bottom of 23.65. While the fact that the rails penetrated the October 10 bottom is disturbing, a break through of less than a full point is not regarded as conclusive under a strict interpretation of the Dow theory. The industrial average x already has broken the lower limits of the trading range, which prevailed since early October, by several points.
The markets abroad were better. In London. the list was quiet, and prices firm. Prices on the Paris bourse ranged higher.
German Elections Ahead
The German elections, which take place next Sunday, may have a far-reaching effect on the securities markets here. The campaign which has been going on has affected the market for German securities listed in this country drastically. with almost uninterrupted declines underway since the National Socialists first indicated that they were determined to stamp out the opposition with almost unprecedented ruthlessness.
The recent turn of political events in Germany also has unsettled business in that country. Unemployment has continued to increase, although the latest figures showed that the total number of unemployed was still under the level prevailing a year previous. Declarations made by National Socialist leaders very clearly indicate that if the Nazis do not obtain a clear majority in the forthcoming election, they are determined to stay in power at whatever cost.
Alcohol and Gasoline
The fact that the President-elect is interested in the possibilities of using surplus farm crops for the production of alcohol as an aid to agriculture did not stimulate the stocks of companies which would be immediately benefited if legislation embodying the plan were adopted. The proposal is unique in many ways, but chiefly so because it is the single method of aiding agriculture which has not called for large expenditures of Government funds, or establishment of a new bureau.
The plan, as outlined, would call for legislation providing the use of a certain proportion of alcohol to gasoline by motor fuel consumers. The legislation undoubtedly would provide that the alcohol to be used should be made only from some commodity, like corn, of which there is a large domestic surplus. Commercial Solvents is one of the largest makers of alcohol from corn.
Steel Output Recedes
The steel industry has felt the effects of the banking troubles in Michigan, and a decline of 2% in the operating rate of the industry 13 the result* Quite naturally, demand for steel from automobile makers has slumped, due to the difficulties resulting from the banking holiday. With automobile demand reduced, the steel industry must rely largely on miscellaneous consumers. Demand for steel from the construction industry, and the, railroads, continues at a very low ebb. Carrfters need new equipment and should be in the,market for supplies for forthcoming track work. They are not buying equipment, and are curtailing expenditures for track maintenance, because their revenues are still going down.
Carrier Loadings Improve
The most conspicuously heartening feature of the weekly loadings statement was the good upturn in both miscellaneous freight and less
