Dollar Rebounds and Stocks Surge 61.01 Points on Trade - Deficit N ews
By Tim Metz
Stuff Reporter of The Wall Sticeet Jouiinai.
Bulls hungry for good news and nervous bears seized on a narrowing in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit to push the dollar and stock nrices higher yesterday.
The dollar rose 0.7% against the West German mark and 0.5% against the Japanese yen despite a slight late sell-off. In the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 61.01 points, its seventh biggest one-day point gain, to 1960.21 in heavy but far from hectic trading. Stocks also rose on other major exchanges around the world. But bond market investors mostly yawned, and Treasury bonds inched up only about */s of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. (Stories on pages 20, 39. and 23).
The stock market gain was among the broadest of recent weeks, with 1,296 New York Stock Exchange issues rising in price while only 386 declined. Volume of 206.3 million shares in the Big Board’s first full 6%-hour trading session since Oct. 22 wasn’t huge, but it was well ahead of the

Before yesterday’s report on the September trade balance, many currency traders and analysts in Asia and Europe were saying the dollar was extensively oversold and ready to rally on anything resembling good news.
The Commerce Department’s 8:30 a.m. EST announcement that the trade deficit narrowed to $14.08 billion from August’s $15.68 billion touched off heavy dollar-buy-ing throughout the morning, even though the number was only a little lower than most analysts and economists had expected.
The buying spree mainly reflected precautionary covering of short, or oversold, positions among investors who remain bearish on the U.S. currency, traders said. Selling intensified in the afternoon, pulling the dollar down from its intraday highs.
Stock market analysts conceded that despite yesterday’s gains, the market’s ills aren’t anywhere near cured. The improve-

ment in the breadth of the advance, compared with Wednesday’s 3-2 edge for stock gainers, and the much stronger volume yesterday means only that “the market has passed from the chicken-soup phase on to more solid food,” Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal & Co., said.
High Anxiety '
Big gainers among blue-chip stocks yesterday included Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, which soared $4,125 a share to $60.50; International Business Machines, which spurted $3 to $122.25; General Electric, up $2,375 to $46.25; General Motors, advancing $2,625 to $60,375; and Ford Motor, up $2.75 to $74.50.	.
Mr. Seagle said the relatively stronger
gains among blue-chips reflected a flight to quality and continuing high anxiety among equity investors.
He said a cautious test of the 2000 level on the industrial average may be imminent, followed by a move up to about 2250. That level would represent a recovery of about 50% of the industrial average’s loss from its Aug. 25 peak above 2722 to its Oct. 19 crash to just over 1738. Mr. Seagle said he would consider that a “realistic near-term recovery" for the market. ,
Stock market rallies around the world yesterday, meanwhile, were set off by overnight rumors, of an imminent accord on cutting the U.S. budget deficit and later by the news of the narrowed U.S. trade gap.	’
Tokyo Rebounds	,
Much later, after U.S. stock markets closed, reports began to surface that the budget negotiations had stalled amid Democrats' allegations that President Reagan had rejected the broad outlines of a proposed accord. If the talks have hit a snag, that could be a major bearish factor when stock trading resumes today, analysts said.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks, which plunged 649.70 points Wednesday, rebounded 509.74 yesterday to close at 21546.50. In London, the Financial Times 30-share index surged 38.8 to 1328.8.
In addition to the U.S. trade figures, which came out around the middle of the British trading day, London dealers cited evidence of renewed strong institutional buying in that market.
Japanese traders cited rumors that the government had asked securities firms not to sell shares of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone in the open market ahead of this week's planned big new issue of NTT stock.
Japanese trading volume was somewhat depressed yesterday by caution ahead of the release of the U.S. trade deficit figures.	.
