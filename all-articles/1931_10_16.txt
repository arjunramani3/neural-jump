........... .......   .	the Dnu-Jnnrs ages, telth cKarta,.from iatt pa go.
Improvement came into the stock market yesterday. During the forenoon there was some uncertainty because of fears regarding the interpretation which would be placed on the further advance in the rc-discount rate by the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Apparently the view that this action would have a favorable influence over the long period predominated, for selling which came into the leading stocks was well absorbed. The railroad shares were in better demand on the revival of the weekly rumor that a favorable decision on the freight rate case might be handed down by the Interstate Commerce Commission over the week-end. During the afternoon the market was influenced by more encouraging advices from the steel trade, where a moderate improvement is reported to have occurred recently, and by predictions that no change would be made in the current dividend rate of 84 a share on U. S. Steel common. Profit-taking which came at the beginning of the final hour was easily absorbed and in the late dealings the market developed pronounced strength, with many issues closing at or near the highest of the day.
There are indications of somewhat more cheerfulness in the financial district. However, conservative observers are still in favor of waiting for reactions to make scale purchases, and advised clients with long positions to ducc holdings on any further upturn.
Another New Low in Brokers’ Loans
Another new low record was reported in brokers' loans for the past week, at 3928,000.000. This	a decrease of 373,000,000, or 7.29*/r»
from the preceding seven days. The drop occurred during the period when the Dow-Jones industrial averages 0 90. to 100 24 In it was interesting to direct to non-broker to 81.704,000.000.
Detailed figures show that brokers decreased loans with member banks by 899.000,000, to a new low record of $699,000,000. There was an increase of $8,000,000 in borrowings from out-of-town banks, while loans from others rose SIS,000,000. Demand borrowings showed a decrease of $38,000,000. to 8644.000.000. and time loans went down 835,000,000, to $284,000,000.
recorded an advance of contrast to the showing, note that loans on security customers rose S35.000.000,
Credit Corporation Discussed
Discussions on the new National Credit Corp are general in the financial district. The most popular impression is that when the new* corporation is functioning, it will do much to strengthen the banking system. Many banking institutions will be provided with, loans on coi-lntoral which is good but which is not accepted for rediscount by Federal Reserve banks. All in all, the plan is likely to be decidedly beneficial to the banking business, and must eventually have its effect on general business conditions.
re-
the the the
Commission House* Bought on Balance
Commission houses were buyers during
■ hesitation early In the day. and although advances later caused some outside selling,
leading firms purchased on balance. Frofes-sionals and floor traders covered shorts during the recessions Some of the operators with
, long positions were taking profits toward the [ close and as a result this element sold on balance.
Wheat Advance** Should
Aid Scars-Koebiick
Should there lx* an advance m wheat prices, as so many grain speculators have been predicting. the effect on Sears Roebuck would be beneficial marketwise. The stock usually responds to improvement in conditions affecting agricultural districts. Although sales of the company this year have been below those for the corresponding period of 1930 the economies which have been put into effect are said to have resulted in a somewhat better profit margin.
> Rediscount Rate
i Alliance
| Although many in Wall Street were confident
! that there would be further advances in the , Federal Reserve Bank’s rediscount-rate, it was ; not generally believed that the upturn would 1 come only a week after the first raise was made.
For that reason the New York action was somewhat of a surprise While banking interests have asserted consistently that this country could lose considerably mo-e gold without any ill effect here, some financial Interests hold the opinion that continued heavy gold exports and earmarkings of the precious metal has been a factor in the rate upturns One important result of the higher rediscount will be the restoration of earning power to the banks. It also I should bring about less discrepancy between short term and long time money rates, and in the end might lead to a return flow of idle currency to the banks
Speculative Buying
In J. I. Case
Speculate e buying has been in progress in .7. I. Case at times recently, based on the fact that as the stock was one of the popular targets ( for short selling in the past, a short interest ■ might still bo in existence. A number of the ; important operators who were pessimistic on the : «tock for a long time are known to have cov-1 cred most of their outstanding obligations about j two weeks ago.
| First National
1 Store*	.
Earnings of First National Stores are reported to be holding up comparatively well, considering general business conditions. This is attributed to the fact that the management has been able to effect efficient distribution methods which have permitted the carrying of an unusually low inventory, so that commodity price declines could bo immediately	*
in the retail selling levels.
Woolworth’s Dividend
Action
Declaration of an extra dividend of S2 by Woolworth this week did not have any great market influence, mainly because such a distribution has been discussed ever since the company sold a share interest in the British subsidiary to the English public. As a matter of fact there was some disappointment because interests who had been prominent on the long side of the stock before the last break in the market had assured friends that the directors would increase the regular dividend to a $3 annual rate Such action, had it been taken, may have had a more beneficial influence on the stock at this time.
Allied Chemical
Well Liked
Allied Chemical is one of the stocks which is well liked in many quarters for a long pull While no one is willing; to predict the immediate movement in the stock, some observers maintain that improvement in general business conditions will find the stock among the favorites again. The company was in a strong financial position nt the end of last y-...........
nt the end of last year, but necessitous liquidation which came into the general market did not spare Allied when the declines were in progress.

General Railway	.
| Signal
- Anv improvement in the railroad I is likely to be reflected in increased I for General Railway Signal. Meanwhile ! company has secured the large contract for | subway work for which it was the low bidder recently Experiences of several railroads in the past are said to have shown that installation of the company's equipment pays for itself within a comparatively few years and results in largo savings thereafter. This fact should attract business once the carriers arc again m , a position to take up expenditures for safety j and other economical equipment of their lines.
