Profit-taking; came into the market in increasing volume yesterday. Coupled with a reaction in wheat prices, after early substantial gains had been scored, it was enough to bring a set-back in stocks. Leaders showed losses running to 4 points or more, but most active issues were not oft so much. Trading volume was sharply below the fast pace set on Thursday.
Even in the bond market, profit taking operations had a depressing effect. The market was irregular early, but firmed up somewhat later in the session. High-grade and second-grade rails suffered the most during the periods of reaction, while utility and industrial obligations were steady. Government bonds pushed ahead once more. Easier money conditions, with declining interest rates, benefited the market for Governments.
Wheat was strong early in Chicago, with some deliveries up as much as 3 cents a bushel. It reacted later, and lost all the early gain. May wheat closed down % to "«-ccnt a bushel. Heavy profit-taking came into the market on the early bulge. Cotton was lower from the start, and at the close was down around $1.50 a bale.
Washington New* No Stimulation
Washington furnished the major piece of overnight news. This time it was the new Administration’s farm relief plan, and it did not get as enthusiastic a reception as have the President’s other moves. Passage of the beer bill by the Senate was expected, and it gave no fillip to the beer stocks.
Gold stocks came in for attention as the rest of the market turned reactionary. Homestakc ^advanced 6 points, Alaska Juneau pushed ahead, and the other members of the group were active.
Opening prices found the market lower, with some stocks off more than 2 points. American Telephone recorded the biggest loss at the start, opening at 103 5-. off 21-. Allied Chemical was under pressure.’ It *was one of the few stocks which was soft in the late dealings' on Thursday, and opened down almost 2 points. Appearance. overnight, of the annual report was a factor in depressing the stock.
Trading Slackens
Trading was at a more normal pace. In the first half hour, volume was less than 50% of the total for the similar period Thursday, when the ticker lagged as much as 8 minutes behind.
During the morning, the list managed to rally somewhat from the early lows. Most stocks ruled fractionally under the previous colse, and volume of trading was small. Around noon, buying came into the railroad shares, and they pushed ahead strongly for a time. DeJa-ware & Hudson, New York Central. Chesa-! peake & Ohio, and Union Pacific did the best, 1 Atchison lagged on the advance.
The market had another sinking spell in the afternoon, with J. I. Case dropping off swiftly as wheat reacted. The whole list turned heavy, but there was no great pressure cn the market.
Money renewed at 4r/f , declined to 3’i%, and in the afternoon dropped to 3%. Bankers’ acceptances were reduced again, and money was easier all round.
Markets abroad did little. In London, price*? were irregular. British funds were higher, but German bonds declined. Trading on the Pans Bourse was very quiet.
The Allied Chemical Report
The Allied Chemical report was a disappointment in a good many directions. In the first place, net income for 1932 was equal to only $3.62 a share on the 2,401,288 capital shares outstanding, compared with Wall Street guessex that it would run to as much as $5 a share. In the second the company failed to give any real information in regard to its security holdings.
By following its previous course in regard to annual reports. Allied maintains its position as one of the "mystery” companies. in 1929 “mystery” companies had a flavor with the public that increased speculative interest in them The depression has taken most of ttie glamor away from the “mystery” companies, and more and more stockholders are asking for complete information in regard to their companies. Alliea is distinctly out of step with the current trend in clinging to its old form of annual report, and giving stockholders no information as to the company’s investment holdings Stockholders are entitled to the information, and most company managements have recognized the changed sentiment, and patterned their annual statements accordingly.
The bare figures given by the company showed an increase in cash and an advance in the company’s investment holdings. Government bonds and marketable securities were dawn to $92,404,341 from $94,638,155. The depreciation reserve was increased to $128,237,567, up $6,510,627 from the previous year. Depreciation charges judged by the increase in reserve, were larger in 1932 than in the two previous years, and just a little under the amount set aside in 1929 for depreciation.
ports brought them to the $100,000,000 mark, the first time since the depression began that this level has been threatened.
Turn Must Come
Railroad equipment makers in this country have suffered an enoromus shrinkage in their business, but the annual report of the Canadian Locomotive Co. for 1932 contains a note which indicates that Canadian railroad equipment makers have suffered even more extensively. “No locomotive orders have been placed in Canada since June, 1930;” the president says. The dearth of orders represents a long-time record. As the president insists, ‘‘any marked improvement in railway earnings would warrant the railways in adopting some definite policy of replenishment.”
The Recovery in Commodities
Based on a number of Indices, commodity prices now are somewhere around 10% above the level prevailing before the banking holiday, a level which had been maintained Eince late 1932. A 10% rise in commodities brings a radical change in the picture of many industries, and improves profit-making possibilities. The rise in commodity prices has taken place so abruptly that there is a general attitude of skepticism as to whether the new level for commodities can be held. ^If the present level is maintained, the higher range may serve as a background for a further advance in security* prices. StockB at present arc at about the same level which prevailed early in January.

Export Trade Slumps
The slump In the country’s export trade in February brings home the need for international cooperation in world economic readjustment. The drastic decline in our exports, which in February were at the lowest level since August, 1904, ia due in part to the international dislocation caused .toy tariff barriers. The world economic conferences offers a tremendous opportunity to lift some of these barriers.
Exports from the United States in February were down more than 30% from February’, 1932. Imports showed an even larger shrinkage, on a percentage basis. The decline in ex-
