stock aver-
poration bonds Saturday reached 71.45, two fractional points above the high achieved June 7 on the recovery move from the low set on the fl rat, day of the month. In .pushing through the top of previous upswings, the bond averages executed what would be regarded, if stock averages were under consideration, as a distinctly significant movement Twice before during the long period of declining prices for bonds, which started more than ayear ago, the average has bad a similar upturn, surpassing the high of a previous recovery movement, but both	the downswing was resumed.
After dropping to 65.78 on June 1, the bond average rallied to the recovery peak of June 7. The average then underwent, according to interpretations of the stock averages, a secondary reaction, dipping to 69.62 on June 30. Since that time, the average has advanced in 11 out of the 12 trading sessions ended Saturday, the last ten sessions being marked by gains.
Taken in conjunction with the betterment in commodity* prices, the rally in bonds must be regarded as of significance. If the gains can be continued, and the average holds above the June 7 recovery, it will be distinctly inspiriting.
City Subway Financing A Ticklish Problem
The securities markets reacted yesterday, pivotal stocks dipping1 under a renewal of liquidation. The tone of the bond market was steady but some irregularity broke out in the late trading. Governments, particularly those bearing a low coupon, were strong, but the low priced rails weakened somewhat. Commodities were varied, wheat moving up fractionally, while corn sold off.
The reaction was attributed, in part, to the fact that prospective adjournment of Congress had been discounted, and actual adjournment brought out some selling in stocks. Then too, Wall Street had before it the quarterly reports of two of the^bigger industrial companies, Westinghouse and du Font, both of which attested to the drab business picture. Westinghouse had a larger loss in the second quarter than in the first, and du Font, without dividends on its General Motors stock holdings, would have reported only *4 cents a share earned on its common stock for the quarter.
Consolation in. Fisher Commodity Index
Outside of earnings reports. Wall Street had to regard commodity price figures for coxisolation. Fisher’s index recorded another advance in the week ended July 15, continuing the gain which began in June. The advance since June 17, on. a percentage basis, has been the widest since commodity prices began to tumble late in 1929.
Atchison loadings for the week ended July 16 were up substantially from the preceding week, which Included the July 4 holiday, and also showed a decline of only 30.5% from the like, week of 1931, in contrast to a decline of 43.1% recorded for the two weeks ended July 9 from the like period of last year. The daily loadings over the road have recorded a sharp pickup recently.
There* was* little else, outside of the steel operations figures, of immediate import. From the long-term standpoint, the prospects of success for the British bond conversion plan are distinctly encouraging. In the neighborhood of 90% of the holders of the war loan bonds have indicated their intention of converting.
Steady Tone in Bonds Held Good Sign
The reaction in pivotal stocks yesterday was somewhat discouraging, but the steady tone in the bond market was a favorable sign. Industrial stocks have shown inability to carry through the 45-46 for the Dow-Jones industrial average In any volume, and resistance has increased as they entered that range. Conservative interests suggest that investors continue to await developments before making any turther commitment.

Mayor Walker is reported to be considering a change-over from the Delaney Plan of city subway financing, ■which Involves issuance of short-term city obligations, to a program which would provide for financing further subway construction on a long-term basis. The Mayor, in pondering the subject, is between the devil of politics and the deep sea of economics. He must, if he decides to push the change, abandon any lingering hope of preserving the five-cent fare on the city lines. However, the shift would make possible a heavy cut in the annual city budget, which could be passed on to the taxpayers.
The Delaney Flan of subway financing was devised with an eye mainly on the preservation of the five-cent fare. It is designed to wipe out speedily the debt incurred in subway construction, so that the new subway line revenues can support the amount of city debt actually outstanding against them when the new lines, under the law, must be put on a self-sustaining basis.
Even continuance of the Delaney Flan might not achieve preservation of the five-cent fare, •however, for the cost of the new subway lines has far exceeded original estimates, and traffic undoubtedly will not come up to original expectations. But there is always the possibility that it might save it. and the five-cent fare has stood "ill good stead a political war-crj’ for years.
Long-term financing of city subway construction means death to any hope of preserving the fare or the war-cry.
From the point of view of the independent subway companies, a change to long-term financing by the city would be favorable. If the city -grant-preservation of the five-cent fare, it would have to go through with unification. If the city decided that it would embark on municipal operation, eventually the fare would have to be raised, and the companies then might also get a higher fare. Even if they did not. they would take traffic away from the city’s lines.	<.
