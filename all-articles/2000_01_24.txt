The Nasdaq Composite Index, which had just set three consecutive closing records, suffered its fourth-worst point drop ever, falling 139.32 points, or 3.29%, to 4096.08. It wasn't among the 20 steepest in percentage terms, however. It also was only the index's third-heaviest point drop this month, in what has been a remarkably volatile beginning of the year.
For the first time in five sessions, the Nasdaq Composite's performance was worse than that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow industrials fell 243.54 points, or 2.16%, to 11008.17, their 10th-sharpest one-day point drop ever, although also not among the sharpest in percentage terms. At their worst, about half an hour before the close, the industrials were down 333.82. Then they recovered sharply as bargain-hunters stepped in to buy.
Traders and money managers called the drop more of a natural pullback following the tech sector's huge recent gains than the results of any of the day's specific events. They noted that some big institutions have been shifting money out of stocks and into bonds for several days, on the idea that big recent drops in bonds' prices have made them cheap compared with high-priced stocks.

The technology-stock boom suddenly stalled, pushing highflying tech stocks into a dive and sending major stock indexes to some of their sharpest point drops ever.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, which had just set three consecutive closing records, suffered its fourth-worst point drop ever, falling 139.32 points, or 3.29%, to 4096.08. It wasn't among the 20 steepest in percentage terms, however. It also was only the index's third-heaviest point drop this month, in what has been a remarkably volatile beginning of the year.
For the first time in five sessions, the Nasdaq Composite's performance was worse than that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow industrials fell 243.54 points, or 2.16%, to 11008.17, their 10th-sharpest one-day point drop ever, although also not among the sharpest in percentage terms. At their worst, about half an hour before the close, the industrials were down 333.82. Then they recovered sharply as bargain-hunters stepped in to buy.
"In some sectors it did start looking like panic selling for a little while," said Dan Mathisson, head stock trader at D.E. Shaw Securities. "Retail and institutional customers were just whacking any bid they could see. But at the end of the day we did see a bounceback as people started looking at it as a buying opportunity." Some of the sharpest decliners were recent tech leaders such as Qualcomm, JDS Uniphase and i2 Technologies.
Traders and money managers called the drop more of a natural pullback following the tech sector's huge recent gains than the results of any of the day's specific events. They noted that some big institutions have been shifting money out of stocks and into bonds for several days, on the idea that big recent drops in bonds' prices have made them cheap compared with high-priced stocks.
"This didn't come as a total surprise," said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, who said he has been seeing the shift to bonds in recent days. "It sounds a lot worse than it was."
After steady declines earlier this month, bonds turned around and started recovering last week. Yesterday, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 20/32, or $6.25 for a $1,000 bond, pulling the yield down to 6.644%. Last week, the yield, which moves inversely to price, had been as high as 6.75%, before bonds began to recover.
Traders noted various bits of news that might have helped set off the selling. Procter & Gamble announced that it was dropping efforts to acquire Warner-Lambert and American Home Products. That squelched talk of a takeover binge in the drug sector, sending some drug stocks down.
On top of that, two voting members of the Federal Reserve's policy committee dropped clear hints that the Fed plans to keep raising interest rates.
Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a speech that last year's three increases in the Fed's benchmark rates hadn't "done anything to dampen consumer demand." San Francisco Fed President Robert Parry later made similar comments. That reinforced the view that the Fed will raise rates at least once more.
But Bill Kirby, head of government-bond trading at Prudential Securities, pointed out that investors for weeks have been expecting the Fed to announce a rate boost after its two-day policy meeting ends on Wednesday of next week. If anything, he said, recent Fed signals have convinced most traders that the Fed will raise rates by only a quarterpoint, not a half-point.
That helps explain why bonds have recovered. In addition, "we are seeing a little bit of a flight to quality," as people leave stocks for bonds, he said.
Some stock investors may be belatedly waking up to the impending Fed meeting. But few traders said that was what was driving the stock market or bond market.
Bond trading remained light, which helps explain why bonds have been moving sharply. But stock trading remained heavy, suggesting that a lot of investors were moving money at least temporarily into cash. Volume on the Nasdaq Stock Market, at 1.91 billion shares, was the heaviest ever, and New York Stock Exchange volume of 1.1 billion marked that exchange's 11th busiest day.
Some traders said the late-day rally may have been helped by a comment from Dallas Fed president Robert McTeer that the consumer price index overstates inflation.

The two biggest point-losers among the Dow industrials, based on their 4 p.m. closes on the New York Stock Exchange, were General Electric and Johnson & Johnson. GE fell $5.9375 to $138.125 and J&J dropped $6.1875 to $83.6875.
GE suffered in part from a critical article in Barron's, while J&J was hit by news that the Food and Drug Administration was strengthening warnings about a lucrative J&J heartburn drug, Propulsid.
But the broader selling was "more of a sentiment move" based on concerns about high tech-stock prices than a reaction to any special news, said Mr. Mathisson of D.E. Shaw. "With a sentiment move it is hard to guess what really caused it. Once they start it is more like an avalanche."
In fact, even as tech stocks soared last week, most other stocks already were under attack. The Dow industrials fell on all four of last week's trading days (exchanges were closed Monday in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday). After yesterday's decline, the industrials now have fallen for five consecutive trading days following their record close on Jan. 14. The last time they fell for five days in a row was in December 1998. The industrials now are down 6% from their record.
The Russell 2000 small-stock index, which had set five consecutive records, also fell, giving up 10.99 points, or 2.06%, to close at 522.95.
The broadest big-stock index, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, declined 39.83, or 2.76%, to 1401.53, its seventh heaviest drop in point terms, although not among the biggest in percentage terms.
"The market was ahead of itself and was due for some retracement," said Mr. Clark of Credit Suisse First Boston. "In fact, I would go a step farther and say that it is probably a healthy thing."
Will it continue?
"Maybe what we are seeing is the first stage of a correction," or a drop of 10% or more in index values, said J. Thomas Madden, chief investment officer at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. "That isn't a bold forecast given the progress the market leaders made in the last months of 1999."
He too thinks a further pullback among the hot tech stocks would be healthy, and he thinks they will recover to surge again afterward.
He added that yesterday could be viewed as "a rotation away from tech leadership and back toward some of the less loved or more controversial names," noting that EDS and Lucent posted gains for the day.
Internet-related stocks, however, were among the big losers, and the 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index fell 20.93, or 4.87%, to 408.58. Yahoo! and eBay posted big drops.
The average share of stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell 96 cents, or 2.09%, to $45.08.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.97 point to 185.38.
In major market action:
Stocks fell and bonds rose. On the Big Board, 1,033 stocks advanced and 2,019 declined.
The dollar rose. Late in New York, it traded at $1.0070 to the euro and 105.65 yen to the dollar, from $1.0085 and 104.83 yen.
