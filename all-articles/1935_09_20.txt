'Highlights From the Week’s Record of Economic and, Foliti-cal Developments
BUSINESS—
A report from the Department of Commerce last week that industrial activity in the first half of September had made a good showing in comparison with 1934, received support from the carloadings figure for week before last. The total was above 700,000 and best in almost four years. Heavy coal shipments, as a precaution against the long-threatened strike, were a factor, of course. The first few railroads to report August earnings results showed net operating Income substantially above that for the like 1934 month. .
Another cheering statistic was electric output for week before last. It was just under the top 'production for any summer week in history, set recently.
Reports from various steel production centers at the end of last week indicated that operations generally were continuing at a steady pace.
The steel industry, of course, is looking toward the auto industry for a pickup in demand for its products. Week before last auto output was at a low rate as the car makers prepared to start production of new models. A few already have started with their 1936 models and the first of next month is expected to see most of the lines ready to begin production. Although Buick announced some price reductions last week it was believed at Detroit that 1936 model prices in general would be little changed.
BANKING AND FINANCE—-
“I am extremely sorry,” wrote President Roosevelt to Joseph J. Kennedy last week, “that your personal circumstances compel you to retire from the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission.” The financial community was sorry, too. Mr. Kennedy retires today.
President Roosevelt also announced last week that Marriner S. Eccles, present Federal Reserve Board governor* would be named head of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, a new arrangement under the banking law passed by the last session Congress.
Total of bond offerings this week is expected to be one of the largest so far this year. Last week, offerings totaled about $72,000,000, compared with a little more than $96,000,000 in the previous week.
Federal Reserve statements for the week ended last Wednesday .showed (1) a $30,000,000 increase in commercial loans of New Xork City reporting member banks, and (2) a $260.000,000 decline In member banks* excess reserves.

A firm “No" was Italy’s answer Saturday to the League’s latest plan for peace.

One of the outstanding financial developments last week in connection with the war scare was the substantial gold movement toward the United States.
