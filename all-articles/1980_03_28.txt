An Appraisal: After Big Tumble, Bargain Hunting Is in Evidence
Abreast of the Market
By Gene G. Makcul
As Lee Cooperman was leaving his office for an outside meeting Thursday afternoon, one of Goldman Sachs & Co.’s portfolio managers rushed after him to warn that the Dow Jones industrial average had suddenly broken below 742 and was dropping like a stone. At that moment, the average was down nearly 25 points.
“Buy our (recommended) stocks!” boomed Mr. Cooperman, the chairman of Goldman’s investment policy committee. That was about 3:15 pan. When he got back to his office an hour later, Mr. Cooperman realized he almost had missed that sharp market downswing. Within a half hour, the industrial average had snapped back, recouping about 22 points ot the 25.43 points it had lost at 3:30 p.m. It closed at 759.98, off a slim 2.14 points. Friday, the recovery continued vigorously, with the Dow industrials climbing 17.67 points to 777.65.
Evidently, there were others like Mr. Cooperman who started bargain hunting after the market tumbled Thursday to its lowest level since April 4, 1978, when the market closed at 755.37. Had that abrupt market plunge occurred in
early February, Mr. Cooperman would have shouted "sell.” He was urging clients then to reduce commitments in stocks and to raise cash equivalents.
Mr. Cooperman promptly switched signals Thursday afternoon. "We believe that in terms of price, the market’s 16% drop since mid-February has largely adjusted to a level where once again stocks should be accumulated,” says the Goldman Sachs investment strategist.
He expects the market to enter a “sideways and choppy” pattern soon, however, until more information regarding the economic outlook is available.
James E. Moltz, president of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., a New York securities concern, believes the biggest worry of the markets is “whether the nation's financial structure will be able to cope with the pressures and problems we are seeing,” including the collapse of commodity prices and pressure on banks.
Although he, like most investors, still is trying to gauge "when this spike in interest rates will break,” Mr. Moltz likes the prices at which such big companies as those included in Dow Jones averages, are selling. “On a two- to three-year basis, these stocks are exceptionally cheap, such as General Motors, General Electric and Du Pont,” Mr. Moltz contends.
The average portfolios, he advises, currently should be using their cash reserves to buy equities on a "controlled basis.” Certainly, at least 75% of such reserves should be going into equities in the next two quarters, Mr. Moltz adds.
Lee Idleman, chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., is among those who have turned optimistic after Thursday's downturn. The huge volume of selling by those who purchased stocks on credit is “healthy" for the market, he says, and should encourage institutions and “cash accounts” to step up their buying.
"Our Greed-Fear Index has swung markedly to the fear side, and that's positive for the market," claims Mr. Idleman. The theory behind the index is that when fear grips the market and selling swells, the market is pulled closer to a bottom from which stock prices can rebound strongly.
Thursday’s decline is being billed by technical analysts as a rare example of a “classic selling climax." Climactic selling is defined by technicians as a sharp V, constituting a steep drop followed by a very sharp recovery. "Usually, such climactic action generates volume four times larger than the lowest volume In the past 12 months," says William M. LeFevre, investment strategist at Granger & Co.

qualifies Thursday's session as a classic selling climax-of the sort last witnessed in June 1962, when the Dow industrials plunged to 524 from 741, some analysts say. That drop was followed by a steady climb by the average to the 1,000 level in February 1966.
Thursday's high-volume session had the characteristics of both a selling climax and of a huge “double-bottom," or W formation, extending to “as far back as the March 1978 low of 736,” says Thomas F. Fogarty, vice president at Wood Gundy Inc.
Of those who remain cautious about stocks, the main concern still is about uncertainties on interest rates and the credit squeeze. "The volatility of the stock and bond markets will be with us for as long as we have high inflation and the lack of a national consensus to battle it,” says George S. Johnston, president of Scudder, Clark & Stevens, an investment management firm.
