Complete tabulation of t8s Dow-Jones apes, vsith charta, aecond from laat gaga.		stock aver-
All the Interest in yesterday’s stock market was crammed into the first and last half hours of trading. In both these periods, stocks churned higher in an active market. The close of the day’s trading found the leaders up as much as 5 points, in the best rally since November 10. All groups of stocks were strong, but strength in the rails was the real feature of the day.
After early Irregularity, bonds turned upward. Railroad obligations were firm throughout the session, but the domestic list was reactionary elsewhere in the forepart of the session. The bond market, as a whole, had a firm tone at the close. Cotton finished 11 to 15 points higher, but wheat sagged almost 1 cent a bushel.
The upswing In the market drew no stimulus from the immediate news, for there was nothing to bring about such an abrupt reversal. The market’s performance in recent sessions, however. has brought about a good deal of a change in Wall Street psychology. The fact that the Dow-Jones average of 20 railroad stocks held above the October 10 bottom, despite the fact that the industrial average penetrated that re-sisance point conclusively. Impressed chart students. At the first sign of independent strength in the rails yesterday morning, new buying came into the market? In the late upturn, short covering was a factor.
constitutionality of the Texas law will mean that this diversion of traffic will be curtailed heavily, benefiting all Texas roads.
•Frisco Bond Buying
The purchase by the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway of $1,807,000 principal amount of its consolidated 4%% bonds, and their subsequent pledging with the R. F. C. for an additional loan, furnish an extremely interesting chapter in “depression times’* railroad history, with a cash outlay which probably did not run to more ♦han $300,000, the ’Frisco was able to buy in close to $2,000,000 of its funded obligations and be assured of an R. F. C. loan of over $1,000,000 which averted receivership for more than four months. ’
Incidentally, the bonds which the ’Frisco bought in, and $5,693,000 principal amount of the consolidated 6s, are pledged with the R. F. C. to secure loans which amount to $5,190,000.
The scaling down of its debt, at a heavy discount from par, accomplished by the ’Frisco may help it. It way has been found to permit roads to make full use of R. F. C. loans to retire their funded debt at the low prices which have prevailed for months. The ‘Frisco is not the first road which has been able to accomplish this in a small way. The Chicago & Eastern Illinois, through purchases of its consolidated mortgage bonds for the sinking fund, has been able to take advantage of the low prices. For the May 1 sinking fund, the road bought $681,000 principal amount of bonds for a cash outlay of $76,800.

Wall Street applauded the President’s declarations for a sales tax and for cuts in governmental costs. His stand on the wax debts was a mere reiteration of his previous position on this subject. The President’s stand for a reduction in non-service disability allowances for veterans marks the first time that a real move have been made in this direction.

Two Weak Issues Dampen Ardor
The market opened fractionally higher. In the first half hour pivotal stocks were pushed up for gains which ran to as much as 3 points. Weakness in individual issues like Safeway Stores and International Telephone served to dampen the ardor of the bulls somewhat, and stocks for the rest of the morning and early aftemoem made no further important progress. Safeway was weak on the possibility that directors, at the forthcoming meeting, will cut the dividend. Heaviness', in International Telephone was accompanied by rumors in regard to the company’s monoply contract with the Spanish government. Sources, close to the company insisted that the bill introduced in the Cortes, to abrogate the company’s contract, was designed largely to embarrass the present administration. The company was pictured as not seriously disturbed by the Spanish situation. I. T. & T. common sold down from S to 6%, and then rallied to close at 7%, off fractionally.
The rally in th*s final half hour was led by the ’rails. Union Pacific, Atchison, Louisville & Nashville and Norfolk & Western were the 5% at the close, 3% in unusually

exciting. Steel operations were estimated by Dow Jones at slightly below 17%, in the week ended Monday, off from the pre-Thanksgiving week. American Power & Light reduced dividend payments on two issues of preferred stock, and both rallied. Other dividend news furnished no surprises.

prices, there are almost a score of active stocks, traded in on the New York Stock Exchange, which yesterday closed just about at the level prevailing at the close of trading a year earlier.

Aid for the Railroads
The Supreme Court’s declson upholding the constitutionality of the Texas statute regulating contract carriers is a big victory for the railroads. Tho court’s action sets a precedent for other cases which may come before it involving regulation of motor trucks, competing against the railroads for business, and immeasurably aids the railroads in their fight for control of such competition.
Competition against the railroads from trucking companies was peculiarly aggressive in Texas. They were able to divert a large amount of cotton from the railroads to trucks, hauling it from inland points to the Gulf Coast. The fact that the Supreme Court has upheld the
