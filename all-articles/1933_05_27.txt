The Administration’s proposal for abolishing gold payments on all public and private obligations in the United States, except currency, brought a wave of buying into the securities and commodities markets Saturday, sweeping Drices upward in soectacular fashion. Trading in stocks was at a heavy pace, volume for the first hour running’ to 2,560,000 shares, and totaling 4,310,000 for the full two-hour session. The tape lagged 30 minutes behind in the final hour and gains in individual stocks ran from 2 to 10 points. The advance was as spectacular as that which took place at the resumption of trading after the enforced vacation of the bank holiday.
Brokers were swamped with buying orders, and such profit-taking as came into the market was absorbed in good style. The close found stocks near their best prices. Some of the stellar performers were Telephone, U. S. Industrial Alcohol, Union Pacific, Homestake, American Can, Steel common, Kennecott and duPont.
The day’s routine business hews furnished a good backlog for the more stimulating word from Washington. Carloadings showed an un-seasonal increase over the previous week and a large gain over the like week of 1932. Commodities surged upward spectacularly. Wheat sold at the highest p'rlce since late May, 1931, and the May sugar delivery reached the highest price in three years. Cotton rose $1 a bale, and other commodities joined in the advance. Sterling was strong against the dollar, running jip to above $3.97
Bonds were strong, but the gains were less sharp than in stocks. Speculative Issues were the leaders of the forward move.
New York Central’s IVIay Showing
On the basis of traffic figures for the first three weeks of May, New York Central should have a good showing for the month, with net railway operating income moving up close to $3,000,000. The estimate is based on applying the increase in traffic over the April level to the operating income figures reported for that month.
For the first three weeks of May, Central’s loadings, including receipts from connections, averaged 84,503 cars weekly, an increase of 6.5% over the average weekly loadings for April. Own line loadings of the road showed a similar advance over the April level. Central’s April gross reached $20,403,720, with net operating income $1,420,162 .Assuming that gross revenues show an increase in Hnenvit? the traffic upturn, gross for May should run up to around $21,400,000, and If practically the entire increase in gross is carried through to operating income, the latter figure should be moved up to around $2,900,000.
Central’s April showing was extremely encouraging. It reflected the extremely tight hold the management has taken on operating expenses, for despite the fact that gross was down about 16% from the level of April, 1932, railway operating income was just about four times as large as in the like month of 1932.
The upturn in Central’s traffic has brought a complete change in the picture. If the upward trend continues, Central before the year-end should be moving toward cutting down its bank loans and its debt to governmental credit agencies.
The Gold Clause Payment Move .
The Administration's proposal to abolish the gold payment clause on all private and government obligations, except currency, really does not materially alter the situation which has existed in this country by Presidential proclamation. The announcement of the move was the item which touched off the upward swing in prices on Saturday, because it acted as another psychological spur to revive inflation talk.
Actually, the government so far has taken no really important action. The Thomas amendment lodges inflationary powers, of a wide variety, in the hands of the President. One of its provisions covers buying of government securities by the Federal Reserve, and the Federal has purchased $25,000,000, last week’s statement showed. That is the solitary move, so far made, toward inflation, and that is purely credit inflation.
The impetus for the recovery in stocks has come, largely, from the Administration's constant reiteration that prices must be raised. Prices already have gone up enormously from the levels prevailing when President Roosevelt took office, but commodity levels still are below the average prices prevailing in the five-year period 1909 to lftM, generally regarded as the level to which tbe - Administration desires to raise them.

day. Trading in the rights began on May 8, with 12,400 changing hands between the opening price of % and the day’s high of %. The rights permitted .purchase of one new share for each 10 shares held, at 25.
On Saturday, the rights closed at 4%, almost •nine times the opening price. The stock, over the same period, has moved from 80 to 68. an appreciation of only a little more than 100%. The disparity in the percentage of gain in the rights, as compared with that of the stock, is striking.
Incidentally, Owens Illinois Glass and officials of that company, who bought National Distillers stock at $25 a share, have a paper profit at the present time of more than $1,720,000 on their 40,000 shares.
New Highs In the Averages
Saturday’s sweeping gains in stocks and bonds put the Dow-Jones averages at new 1933 highs, and well above the tops for 1932. The Dow-Jones average of 40 bonds closed at 83.30, compared with the 1932 high of 83.26. the industrial -finished above the 1932 highs, going through by a small margin.
While stack trading was heavy Saturday, the total of 4,310,000 fell below the 4,867,500 shares traded in on May 3, 1930. The stock ticker finished printing quotations at 12:41, a record late closing.
