Yesterday's carnage left the blue-chip average-which was down nearly 418 points at one juncture-off 374.47 points, or 3.68%, by day's end, at 9796.03. The Dow Jones industrials are now back where they were nearly a year ago, well below the 10000 milestone the average crossed amid fanfare in March 1999.
To put the industrials' drop in perspective, while the point fall was the fourthheaviest on the history list, in percentage terms it wasn't historic (not even on the top 100 list). Trading was frenetic: Share volume was the second heaviest to date on the New York Stock Exchange, based on 4 p.m. trading, at nearly 1.3 billion shares; the record for 4 p.m. trading is 1.35 billion on Dec. 17, 1999, but that was a "triple witching Friday," when volume is typically inflated because of options expirations.
The trigger for yesterday's slide was P&G's warning of a nasty earnings disappointment; the news hammered its stock 31% and knocked down other members of the industrial average, including General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, J.P. Morgan, American Express and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing. The result was the index's biggest drop in both point and percentage terms since it fell 512.61 points on Aug. 31, 1998, amid a world financial crisis. But in another sign of the market's split personality, hot technology stocks kept the Nasdaq Composite Index in positive territory for much of the day, even as the Old Economy stocks in the rest of the market were crumbling. The Nasdaq's relative strength left optimists hoping that it might somehow manage to finish the day above 5000 for the first time-indeed, the index breached the 5000 mark early in the day. But it couldn't hold on to its gains, closing down 57.01 points, or 1.16%, at 4847.84.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst one-day decline since August 1998, as a bout of flu in Procter & Gamble stock infected a wide range of other shares.
Yesterday's carnage left the blue-chip average-which was down nearly 418 points at one juncture-off 374.47 points, or 3.68%, by day's end, at 9796.03. The Dow Jones industrials are now back where they were nearly a year ago, well below the 10000 milestone the average crossed amid fanfare in March 1999.
Selling pressure was heavy and constant throughout the day, but not to the point that traders were worried about panic selling. For one thing, technology issues managed to stay in positive territory for much of the day. "There wasn't panic, but there was a different sense of urgency in the order flow today, and it was just short of panic," said Jon Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "Definitely there was a heightened sense of urgency in what people were selling."
Investors were left wondering: Is there more pain to come today? Or will this be another one-day blip in a year when the stock market has grown almost accustomed to triple-digit moves in the industrial average, and has often snapped back?
"Not that many years ago, you normally had a follow through" and selling continued after a big down day, noted Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust. "But what we've been seeing in the past two years or so is that some of these big moves can be one-day mood swings."
To put the industrials' drop in perspective, while the point fall was the fourthheaviest on the history list, in percentage terms it wasn't historic (not even on the top 100 list). Trading was frenetic: Share volume was the second heaviest to date on the New York Stock Exchange, based on 4 p.m. trading, at nearly 1.3 billion shares; the record for 4 p.m. trading is 1.35 billion on Dec. 17, 1999, but that was a "triple witching Friday," when volume is typically inflated because of options expirations.
The trigger for yesterday's slide was P&G's warning of a nasty earnings disappointment; the news hammered its stock 31% and knocked down other members of the industrial average, including General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, J.P. Morgan, American Express and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing. The result was the index's biggest drop in both point and percentage terms since it fell 512.61 points on Aug. 31, 1998, amid a world financial crisis. But in another sign of the market's split personality, hot technology stocks kept the Nasdaq Composite Index in positive territory for much of the day, even as the Old Economy stocks in the rest of the market were crumbling. The Nasdaq's relative strength left optimists hoping that it might somehow manage to finish the day above 5000 for the first time-indeed, the index breached the 5000 mark early in the day. But it couldn't hold on to its gains, closing down 57.01 points, or 1.16%, at 4847.84.
Yesterday's drop left the industrial average below 10000, erasing last week's recovery. The industrials now are down more than 16% from their Jan. 14 record close; a drop of 20%, were it to happen, is what Wall Street often uses to mark the onset of a bear market.
Furthermore, because of yesterday's decline, the value of the overall U.S. stock market, as measured by the stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index, is no longer showing a gain for the year.
The Wilshire 5000, which includes about 7,200 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company with headquarters in the U.S., began yesterday with a market value of $15.26 trillion, up from $15.19 trillion at the start of the year. But investors on paper lost a total of about $322.9 billion yesterday. It finished with a total market value, or stock price times total shares outstanding, of about $14.94 trillion, down about $250 billion on the year.
Since Jan. 1, the Wilshire is down 1.65%, compared with year-to-date drops of nearly 15% for the industrials and almost 8% in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Even after yesterday's drop, the Nasdaq composite, reflecting the value of the entire Nasdaq Stock Market, is up 19% since the year began (coming on top of 1999's 86% gain).
Short-term Treasury securities advanced as rattled investors pulled money out of stocks and put some of it in government securities in a so-called flight to quality. The dollar fell against the euro and dropped again against the yen.

Blue Chips Plunge 374.47 on P&G News --- Dow Industrials Post Worst Skid Since August '98 - ProQuest
As the day wore on, some hopeful investors tried to buy up beaten-down Old Economy stocks, in hopes that they were ready to rally. Each time, they were wrong, and the
sellers used the upticks as one more chance to unload unwanted stock in the once-sought-after blue-chip stocks.
A pocket of optimism was to be found in the same place it always has been lately: the techs. Gains in hot semiconductor, biotechnology and software stocks pushed the Nasdaq composite briefly to 5006.78 just after the market opened, its first sojourn ever above 5000. The composite has never closed above 5000.
Another rare pocket of strength was oil-company stocks, which benefited from another surge in crude-oil futures prices, to more than $34 a barrel, and talk that gasoline prices could hit $1.80 a gallon this spring. On a day when most stocks plummeted, Exxon Mobil soared more than $7.
The broader market was hit much less hard than the industrials. The S&P 500, for example, declined 2.56%, or 35.66 points, to 1355.62. The bigger drop in the industrials was because of the fact that P&G is one of just 30 stocks in the industrial average, while it is one of 500 in the S&P 500. The S&P 500, which includes more tech stocks than does the industrial average, now is down just 7.7% from its Dec. 31 record.
P&G caused more than one-third of the drop in the industrials, and traders said the jitters its announcement set off in other stocks were responsible for much of the rest of the industrial average's drop.
The industrial average is calculated on the basis of its components' 4 p.m. EST primary close on the New York Stock Exchange, which doesn't take into account later trading. On that basis, P&G fell $27.3125 to $60.125. Each NYSE-only price move of $1 in a component stock moves the overall average slightly less than five points, so P&G contributed 136.20 points to the average's drop, or 36% of the drop.
The P&G drop was the biggest decline in both price and percentage terms in a component of the industrial average since at least 1988, according to Ned Davis Research, overtaking big one-day drops in IBM and Philip Morris in the 1990s.
P&G, whose brands include Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, warned that higher costs would pull this quarter's per-share earnings 10% to 11% below those of the year-earlier quarter. P&G said earnings would resume their gains in the following quarter, but that for the year ending June 30, per-share earnings would be up about 7%, rather than the expected 13%.
At this point, noted Mr. Olesky of Morgan Stanley, a vast majority of the stocks in the S&P 500 are down more than 20% from their highs, which for market indexes is the standard definition of a bear market. Traders also pointed out that the declines came on exceptionally heavy volume of 1.3 billion shares.
"You've got a full-blown bear market in 80% of the S&P 500, with evidence of capitulation and acceleration in both volume and price decline," Mr. Olesky said.
Some analysts consider that kind of heavy, broad "capitulation"-style selling a sign that the market is starting to hit bottom and turn around.
Investment strategist Thomas Galvin of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette points out that of the 4,000 stocks he follows with market values exceeding $150 billion, 60% are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs.
The stocks that are keeping the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 small-stock index up for the year are a minority of technology stocks that reflect a narrow corner of the market.
"I just saw a chart that showed that if you took out the technology components of the S&P 500, the rest are back to where they were in 1997," said Alfred Kugel, senior investment strategist at Chicago fund manager Stein Roe & Farnham Investment Management. "So two-thirds of the market has shown no net gains in more than two years."
Some analysts said the real problem wasn't just P&G's announcement, but the fact that it followed a harsh speech Monday, in which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan left no doubt that he will raise interest rates until the economy slows noticeably.
Mr. Greenspan has maintained that increased labor productivity, long considered a strength, also creates demand, which he fears will cause the economy to overheat. So when the government announced high levels of productivity gains yesterday morning, normally positive news, some traders decided it was another bad sign.
The weakness in Old Economy stocks continues to be aggravated by investor retreats from mutual funds. In the two weeks ended Monday, $6 billion has flowed out of growth and income funds, which are principally invested in Old Economy bluechip and "value" stocks, while $23 billion has flowed into aggressive growth funds, which invest primarily in technology, according to TrimTabs.com, which tracks money flows.
Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 0.76 point to 189.64.
In major market action:
Stocks fell hard. On the Big Board, where 1.3 billion shares traded, just 974 stocks advanced and 2,061 declined.
Bonds were mixed. Although 30-year Treasury bonds fell slightly, the 10-year note rose 9/32, or $2.8125 for a $1,000 bond, pulling the yield down to 6.362%.
The dollar dropped. Late in New York, it traded at 95.95 cents to the euro and 106.17 yen to the dollar.
