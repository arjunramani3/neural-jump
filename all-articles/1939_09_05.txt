t The entrance of France and Great Britain into the war over the week-end brought a stampede to buy stocks and commodities. Most of the war-affected commodities jumped the limit and brokers stood by idly awaiting another dav in which to transact business. Some of the opening stock transactions were not recorded until the afternoon, hours after the official time for opening such was the weight of buying and the absence of selling inclinations. Some parts of the stock list, however, were adversely affected, several utilities, housing shares, movies nnd business machine companies suffering a decline in the face of buying enthusiasm elsewhere.	•
Volume mounted to 5,900,000 shares, the largest since October. 1937 when the depres-aion of that year was causing liquidation. The price advance was the sharpest since October 6, i 1931. Bethlehem, du Pont, and U. S. Steel jumped 10 to 16 points and closed reasonably close to their best levels The market performance, some thought, resembled the panic of 1929 only this time it was potential buyers who were in a panic to get stocks rather than to liquidate them, Cash buying and margin orders literally disrupted the services of wii£ houses and the orders and inquiries appearing from all parts of the country had brokerage
clerks and partners frantic trying to execute orders and quote prices.	"
U. 8. Steel and Bethlehem opening prices did not appear on the tape until shortly after 11 a. m. Some of the sugars did not appear until the afternoon for there were few offers and buying orders were bunched. A number of low priced sugars and machinery issues practically doubled in price over the week-end. Oils, leather, woolen and chemical Issues were actively bought. Utilities recovered irregularly from early softness Rails staged a sharp gain after early hesitancy. Merchandising issues were backward. Bond prices were highly mixed, the speculative issues pulling up the average while the high grade Issues pulled it down.
CHARTISTS BULLISH—
The market’s emergence out of the 130-140 range measured by tbe Dow-Jones Industrial average was spectacular enough, once the driving power of opening buying orders was unleashed. Those chartists who have been watching a broad triangle forming In the market over the past two years and narrowing down recently Into tbe 130-140 area turned extremely bullish for they were of the opinion that the war issue had crystallized at last, ending much of tbe uncertainty that had been prevalent before war actuauy came
Chartists who have been following this pattern bought after the first hour, disregarding the extent of the advances recorded over the week-end, for it was their opinion that the market had signalled that it has appraised the significance of the war and registered its viewpoint in no uncertain fashion.
DISCRIMINATING—
For al! the apparent abandon with which orders poured into the market from all parts of the country, it was noticeable that the buying movement was highly selective from the start. The movie issues and business machine companies with interests and properties abroad were again soft and the utilities and rails were backward In the early dealings. Toward midday, however, rail shares snapped out of their lethargy rather suddenly, apparently realizing that though their rates were fix.ed and higher commodity prices would boost their costs, the

SWITCHING—
One reason for the tremendous volume was the considerable amount oi switching that went A great many industrialists and financiers, in high places had taken the position right up I
to the end of last week that there would be no I war and consequently they were not prepared j NEW HIGHS AND LOWS— for this new situation. It would seem from all i Tuesday on the New York________________
the newspaper headlines and radio broadcasts 146 stocks made new highs and 67 stocks made that the financial community should have been j new lows tor tbe year 1939. prepared for an outbreak, yet it seemed that at least two out of three were taking the position either that there would be another Munich or that Hitler would back down at the last moment.
As a consequence of that, there was a great deal of last minute switching in Investments out of the peacetime industries and into those that might be affeced by war. Of course, there were many stocks that straddled both peace and war time categories. However, the mixed character of the market indicated that there was a good deal of shifting in portfolios taking place There was also some switching from high grade bonds into stock by Individuals who were of the opinion that the war would bring higher money rates here. ’	‘	.......

BRAKES—
It is rather remarkable to note that in several conservative financial quarters the opinion Is held that the Administration's ability to cope with a threat of rapidly rising prices may be less effective than it supposes Of course, such a view presupposes that the natural trend in prices is upward and that what we are witnessing is no mere flash in the pan. But taking the position, not proven at the moment, that commodify prices and price levels generally are beaded higher there is an interesting question of the measures and the effectiveness of measures designed to control the movement prices

classified as real controls for the markets have been for some time largely cash markots and economists have been stressing the fact foi some time that the volume of idle cash has tremendous potentialities for credit inflation. Taxes might be increased and such a step would be constructive in that it would bring a balanced budget nearer to fulfillment But that very step, because of its constructive implications, would be apt to encourage the greater use of credit.
Markets that proceed too swiftly naturally
will be subjected to corrective reactions. Reactions also can be brought on by the psychological effect of official statements, designed to produce market effects. It is not such short-run matters, however, that are interesting some financial people in high places; it is the broader market moves lhat will determine how good the controls are.	•
