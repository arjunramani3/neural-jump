Stocks soared, rebounding from the worst week in two months, as signs of life in the housing market and bullish analyst comments on banks sent investors flocking back.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 235.44 points, or 2.8%, to 8504.08, the biggest gain since April 9. The blue-chip measure was helped by a 9.9% surge for its component Bank of America after analysts at Goldman Sachs added the company to their "conviction buy" list.
Investors also were encouraged by better-than-expected earnings at the home-improvement retailer Lowe's. The shares rose 8.1%. The National Association of Home Builders' builder-sentiment index rose to a high unseen since September 2008.
The encouraging signs for the housing market convince investors to spend more of the cash they had previously hoarded. The dollar weakened and Treasury prices rose, as investors moved out of typical safe-haven investments.
"You have a lot of money on the sidelines that's coming off and being used to take on risk," said David Chalupnik, head of equities trading at FAF Advisors in Minneapolis. Mr. Chalupnik was among recent buyers of Bank of America. Rather than selling the stock for a quick profit Monday, he decided to hang on, waiting for the bank to get closer to his target of $17.50, compared with Monday's close of $11.73.
The S&P 500 jumped 26.83 points, or 3%, to 909.71, led by a 6.8% gain in its financial sector.
State Street rose 8.5% after announcing plans to raise capital and pay back the funds received under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program.
Oil futures climbed 4.8% to $59.03 a barrel as traders unwound positions ahead of Tuesday's contract expiration. They also placed last-minute bets ahead of Memorial Day.
