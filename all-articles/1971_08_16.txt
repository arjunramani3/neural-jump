Tension Is Relieved
President Nixon’s new economic program, which he announced Sunday night, caught Wall Street by surprise. "Everyone was amazed to see the whole thing in one package,” said Eldon A. Grimm, senior vice president of Walston A Co. “It relieved the anxiety and tension that had been present in recent weeks,” he added. The industrial average had fallen to a recent low of 839.59 on Aug. 10 after sliding from its year’s high of 950.82 Bet April 28.
The administration’s measures included an immediate 80-day wage-price freeze and the cutting loose of the dollar from the historic |35-an-ounce gold price. A 10% surcharge was Imposed on Imports. The President also asked Congress to restore the investment-tax credit at a temporary 10% rate, to repeal the 7% excise tax on autos and to advance to Jan. 1, 1972, the tax cuts scheduled for a year later. In addition, he moved to cut federal spending by Imposing a 5% cut in federal jobs and deferred a pay boost set for next Jan. 1.
The measures, said Robert P. Colin, research director of Faulkner, Dawldnc A Sullivan, can “bring the U.S. short-term benefits.’’ But he was less sanguine about whether they would provide permanent cures over the longer term for the “structural weaknesses in the economy.” He said they “contain the ingredients for sending the market to new highs,” but he was concerned about how some of the foreign countries may react to the program.
The advance carried along almost all stock groups with the exception of the golds and some international oils. The golds were hit by the President’s move to cut the tie between the dollar and gold. And the oils were hurt by a Wall Street Journal story that said 11 nations seek an ownership role in oil concessions.
Strength in some of the glamor stocks, which were particularly strong, was partially attributed to short covering, or the buying of shares to replace borrowed stock that had been sold earlier.
Gainers also swamped the losers on the American Stock Exchange and its index spurted 0.54 to 2S.13. Volume climbed to 8,610,000 shares from 2,250,000 on Friday.
The Dow Jones transportation average made an even greater percentage gain than the industrial average-5.13% against 3.84%. And the utility average also scored a big rise.
The heavy participation of Institutions in yesterday’s activity was Indicated by the record number of 196 trades of 10,000 shares, or more, up from 72 in the previous session.
But a big role In yesterday’s performance also was played by the public. “The small investor was in there—there was no doubt about that,” asserted Larry Wachtel, vice president of Bache A Co. He reported that the number of 100 and 200-share orders handled by Bache, an indication of the small trader's participation, was “at a magnitude we haven’t seen for months.”
He also likened the market’s dramatic surge to the reaction that followed President Johnson's announcement at the end of March 1968 of a partial bombing halt in Vietnam. And he thinks that during the next few weeks the market may behave as it did then. On the day after the Johnson statement the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 20.58 points and during April of that year it rose 71 points. The market’s recent technical position, he maintained, was similar to what it was then.
A continued bull market also is the expectation of Robert Stovall, Reynolds A Co. .partner. “The market’s got three or four good weeks ahead of It at the very least,” he commented, noting that “all of President Nixon’s money proposals require congressional approval and Congress isn't scheduled to reconvene until September.” In the meantime, he
said, “imagination is better than fact when you get a trend rolling.”
He believes gold stocks will continue to feel the unfavorable impact of the administration's move to cut loose the dollar from the historic $35-an-ounce gold price. He thinks, too, that international airlines, such as Trans World Airlines and Pan American World Airways also might experience some unfavorable reaction.
Over the short term the rrarket "may be overcelebrating” the unexpected news from Washington, in the view of Richard A. Smith, managing partner of Fllor, Bullard A Smyth. But over the extended period he looks tor the "exceptionally bold” steps taken by Mr. Nixon to be “definitely beneficial” for the economy and the stock market.
And on the International front, he said, the move to, in effect, devalue the dollar may strain the friendships of the U.S. with Japan and Germany "but we’ve got to get back on the track."
Of the 30 stocks in the industrial average, 26 moved to higher ground while three turned down. General Motors never opened because of an imbalance in orders; In calculating the rise in the industrial average the closing price of General Motors on Friday, 76%, was used.
Chrysler was among the sharpest gainers, Jumping 4% to 30% as the most active issue on volume of 761,700 shares. Brokers noted that demand for the auto stocks was ignited by the imposition of the 10% surcharge on imports and the proposal to repeal the 7% autoexcise tax and to speed the tax cuts. Ford and American Motors also didn't trade yesterday.
General Electric, third most active, climbed 3% to 59. Goodyear, in fourth place, moved up 2% to 33. Bethlehem Steel, fifth most active, rose 2% to 24% and U.S. Steel, in ninth place, gained 3% to 31.

Also in the loss column was Sory. It dropped 3 to 16 as the second most active issue on turnover of 415,500 shares. The 10% surcharge on imports was cited as the cause of its weakness. Flying Tiger, also active, fell 2% to 33%.
