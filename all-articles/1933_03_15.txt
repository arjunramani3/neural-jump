1933
The independents have suffered more than tbe Steel Corp, from the slackening demand from tbe automobile makers. They felt tbe effects of the Detroit banking holiday immediately. Any pickup in motor production will bring a sharper upturn in the operating rate of the independents than in the Steel Corp. The latter will be the major beneficiary steel buying gets under way in any
if railroad volume.

tax Date Extension
Extension of the date for filing returns-undoubtedly was a factor in of some selling orders in stocks,
viduals who have to meet income tax payments planned to raise cash by disposing of securities. They withdrew orders when they learned that they had a period of grace, even though interest at 6% must be paid during the two weeks between March 15 and 31.
for equities
The dramatic upswing In prices yetserday carried the market around the lower limits of the trading range which has prevailed for months to the upper limits of that area. Since October 10, the market had been fluctuating in a trading range. Since mid-December, the range has narrowed, with its upper limit, around 65 for the Dow-Jones industrial average arid just under 30 for the railroad shares. At last night’s close, the Dow-Jones industrial average stood at 62.10 and the rails at 29.19.
The high for the averages since October 10 the industrials and 30.61 for the on November 12.
Steel Preferred
Steel preferred was about the only leader in which a wide spread existed between bid and asked prices at the start of trading. The aid of the ticker was invoked to negotiate a transaction. Tbe best bid was 5914, with 66 the asked price. Another bid and offered was printed at 5914., with the offering price at 62. and the opening came not long after on a sale of 400 shares at 60 ’-4 , up 4 If.

The Reopening
Hecla had the honor of being the
Calumel & first stock to appear on the ticker at the reopening. A trade of 100 shares, at	up % from
the last previous transaction, started off the day’s proceedings. All the leaders opened above their closing levels on March 3.
The most spectacular gain at the start was in Owens Illinois Glass. The stock was one of the late openers, and trading in it was begun with a transaction involving 1,700 shares at 40. up 6 points. In the copper stocks, percentage gams were wide. Kennecott. for instance, began at 9%. up 17s points or roughly 23% from its last price. Aircraft, at 21, was up more than 10%, and there were wide percentage gains in other low-priced shares.
Before the opening, orders in brokerage houses were not particularly large, but there was something of an influx soon after tbe start. Volume in a number oL the leaders was large. Some of the shorts covered commitments in the early dealings.
Kailroad Reorganizations Ahead
The interlude of business suspension has made a good many forget that the Bankruptcy Bill is now in operation, and that several railroads are like^r tjo take advantage of its provisions; over the' near future. The business breathing spell gave some railroad managers an opportunity to round out plans for capital readjustments. The sooner these readjustments are made,- the better. As long as weak railroads scrape along, attempting to avert receivership. they keep expenses at the lowest possible level. Reorganized on a sound basis, railroads are put in a position to replace antiquated equipment with new equipment, and to resume maintenance work on a normal basis
As far as railroad traffic goes, all signs point to a drastic slump in the bank holiday period. In circles where the traffic trend is followed closely, however, it is still believed that by May, weekly carloadings will be running ahead of the corresponding period of 1932. With the surcharges still in effect, the hope is held that railroad earnings in May will make a most favorable comparison with the May. 1932. showing
An example of how the banking holiday paralyzed railroad traffic was given by its effect on New York Central. Loadings on the road s own lines were down 4,712 cars, or more than 11%, from the preceding week, and the gap from the like week of 1932 widened sharply.
