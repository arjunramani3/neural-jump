stock aver-
Sweeping; declines in all classes of securities, from Government bonds to common stocks, took place at the resumption of trading; following* the holiday. The most spectacular breaks were in the bond market, where Governments and the highest grade of domestic corporation issues showed the biggest declines since late 1931. In stocks, losses were generally less than 3 points, although a few of the more volatile issues slumped even more. The stock market was under constant pressure, and the close found the list at about the lows of the day.
Governments opened steady, but a stream of selling orders brought drastic price recessions. Treasury issues, at the day’s lows, were off as much as 2 points ir> some cases, and at the close were off more than a point. Liberty 3 *£8 finished off 7-32s and the Fourth 4’As dropped 1 5-32. The highest grade railroad and utility obligations slumped with the Government issues. and junior obligations sagged. Bond market trading was in fairly heavy volume.
Wheat and cotton could not resist the general downward trend. Wheat finished off cent a bushel and cotton closed off 3 to 3.0 points. Cotton closed above the day’s lows, but wheat was near the bottom.
Good New* Ignored
Worries over the banking situation clouded the financial horizon and overshadowed all other developments. The market derived little nourishment from announcement of the makeup of the Roosevelt Cabinet, and there was enough adverse news, in the shape of dividend reductions, to push the decline in stocks. Such good news as appeared, in the shape of a slight betterment in utility output figures, and better ingoings for the New York Central and the Pennsylvania, failed to help stocks.
The market was heavy at the outset, and was forced lower through the morning as steady liquidation made Its weight felt. In the rails, Atchison, Union Pacific and JNew York Central were heavy spots, and Delaware '& Hudson, *a speculative favorite,M.hit an air hole and dropped sharply. Atchison held firm around 38 for a time, but in the late morning that resistance point was penetrated on volume, and the stock sank rapidly; the close found it at 36’za. off 2®^. Union Pacific. 66*%, was off 2Si, and New York Central finished at 14Si. off I7*.
The utilities were heavy. A reduction in the North American common stock quarterly dividend, a cut in the Canadian Bell Telephone payment, and other factors reacted unfavorably on the group. Public Service of New Jersey was as heavy as any stock in the group, closing at 29%, off 2%. Consolidated Gas, United Corp, and North American also were heavy.
finance is extremely well known to Wall Street, and his appointment was reassuring in regard to the incoming Administration's stand on the currency question. Mr. Woodin has gained familiarity with the operations of the Federal Reserve as director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In addition, he is in extremely close touch with railroad matters.
Senator Hull was one of the few leaders of the Democratic Party who, in 1928, failed to switch his tariff position. His knowledge of tariffs and their general effect on foreign trade will be of major impoxlance in the forthcoming discussion of world economic affairs.
Telepone Hand-Set Ruling
Action of the Pennsylvania Public Service Commission in ruling that the monthly charge for band sets be discontinued as a permanent charge on telephone customers and limited to the first two years of service Is relatively unimportant from an immediate standpoint, but may set a precedent for other commissions. Introduction of the hand set, and the charge made for it, has precipitated controversies elsewhere. From a long-term standpoint, therefore, the shift might have an important effect on revenues of American Telephone <fc Telegraph operating subsidiaries.
The National City Management 'Fund
Every time full figures are given in regard to management fund or official bonus plans, the public interest over them reaches a new high pitch, and the testimony of Charles E. Mitchell as to the National City’s management rt in Washington proved no exception. While a defense of bonus plans can be offered, it cannot be gainsaid that in the boom years officials made many large profits out of them. The size of these profits was not known to the stockholders. It did not come to light at annual
meetings.	"
The combined management funds of the National City Bank and the National City Co. in 1927 amounted to $3,344,990, and in 1928 to $4,141,023. The National City Bank reported profits in 1927 of $18,473,148, and In 1928 profits were $20,728,880. The bank Included in its profits only dividends from the National City Co. and not the latter’s total net Income.
For 1927, the management fund of the bank and the trust company combined was 18% of the reported profits, available for stockholders, and in 1928, the.management fund was 20% of thia figure. While annual reports pointed out that the profits for stockholders were after deduction of management funds, there was no indication of the size of these funds. Certainly, Mr. Mitchell’s testimony affords further basis for demand* for greater corporate publicity.

Low Wheat Hits Case, Harvester
Lower wheat prices hit Case and International Harvester. Motor Shares dragged lower, affected by difficult conditions in the Michigan area. Trading volume ran up to 1,330,000 shares, almost double Tuesday’s total and the largest since February 14.
The sharp decline in the railroad shares carried the Dow-Jones average of 20 rail stocks below the low points of November and December. The rail average, at the close, stood at 24.03, only .38 of a point above the October 10 bottom. Both the industrials and the utilities already have penetrated by substantial margins the lows established in previous periods of reaction.
Prices were mixed on the Paris bourse. In London, mining shares -were generally higher, but the rest of the list was irregular.
Canadian Pacific
Steady selling in Canadian Pacific has driven the stock to within a fraction of its old low of 71,*, and pressure has been more insistent recently, since directors voted to defer dividend action on the company’s stocks until next month. Drains on the treasury of the Canadian Pacific by its American appendage, the Soo Line; fluctuations in exchange rates which have complicated the C. P. R.’s international business, and refusal of the Canadian Stock Exchange to permit the road to include in last year’s income dividends from Consolidated Mining & Smelting were contributory factors in causing the board's action.
Last month, directors of Consolidated Mining &: Smelting Co., controlled by the C. P. R., declared a 10% stock dividend, payable to stock of record December 31, 1932. On the basis of the market price for Consolidated Mining & Smelting at the year-end. the dividend would have meant about $1,750,000 to C. P. R. Changing of the record date to January 12, following objections by the Canadian Stock Exchange to the initial action, meant that the revenue could not be included in the 1932 income.
Without the Consolidated Mining dividend, it is doubtful that the Canadian Pacific preferred dividend can be shown as fully earned in 1932. So far this year, traffic has been off, with gross operating revenues for the first six weeks of 1933 down about 8% from the like 1932 period.
Canadian Pacific has had to meet new demands on its cash. It is advancing to the Soo Line a total of $5,500,000 during the first six months of this year. The Soo Line and connections arc important to operations of the C. P. R., and for that reason the Canadian Pacific agreed to make the advances to avoid receivership for the Soo Line.
The Cabinet Make-Tip
Wall Stroet generally regarded the appointments of William H. Woodln to the post of Secretary of the Treasury and Senator Cordell Hull as Secretary of State as most satisfactory selections, Mr, Woodin’* xcoord 1a business and
