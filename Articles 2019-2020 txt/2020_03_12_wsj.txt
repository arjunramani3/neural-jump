Stocks Plunge 10% in Dow’s Worst Day Since
1987
Benchmarks slide as S&P, Nasdaq join Dow in bear-market territory

U.S. stocks plunged Thursday in their worst day since the 1987 crash. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell 10%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq tumbled nearly as much to join the Dow in a bear
market.
The furious falls in share prices on rising fears of a global slowdown due to the rapid spread of
coronavirus occurred despite a $1.5 trillion intervention in short-term funding markets by the
Federal Reserve.
The S&P 500 shed more than 7% early, pushing the index into bear-market territory and
triggering a 15-minute halt in trading shortly after the market’s open. The day before, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average had fallen into a bear market, defined as a 20% drop from a previous
high, bringing to a close the longest-ever bull market for U.S. stocks. Back in 1987, the S&P 500
tumbled 20% in what became known as the Black Monday crash.
On Thursday, the Dow industrials shed 2,352.6 points, or 10% to 21,200.62. The S&P 500 sank
260.74 points, or 9.5%, to 2,480.64. And the Nasdaq Composite slid 750.25 points, or 9.4% to
7,201.80.
Companies most exposed to the coronavirus outbreak were particularly hard hit, and airline
and cruise shares helped lead the tumble. United Airlines Holdings dropped 25%, Delta Air
Lines fell 21%, and Spirit Airlines tumbled 33%. Royal Caribbean Cruises plummeted 32%. On
Thursday, Princess Cruises canceled all voyages for the next two months after two of its ships
suffered coronavirus outbreaks.
But few parts of the market were immune. All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 tumbled, with losses led
by the real estate and industrial sectors. Even companies that investors thought would reap the

benefits of the virus tumbled. Clorox ended the day down 6.3%. Gilead Sciences, which has
started testing a virus treatment, fell 6.1%.
The steep losses in stocks Thursday underscored that so far, there has been little remedy
provided by governments and central bankers that could calm jittery investors. After markets
resumed trading shortly before 10 a.m. after the second circuit breaker was triggered this week,
U.S. stocks plummeted. The Fed’s announcement sent shares briefly higher before tumbling
once again.
Central banks and governments around the world have tried to step up in recent weeks with
efforts to help protect the economy. This week, beyond the Fed’s announcement, the European
Central Bank said that it would roll out cheap loans for banks and step-up bond purchases,
while President Trump’s administration outlined a series of steps to backstop the economy and
certain sectors.
Even so, all three major indexes are down more than 16% for the week.
“We are beyond the logical, mathematical approach to things,” said Steven Dudash, president
of Chicago-based IHT Wealth Management. “We’ve got complete overreactions going on
because of the fear of the unknown.”
“When you see that, you can’t expect to see a logical response to interventions,” he said.
The stock declines followed a dizzying amount of new information Wednesday night about the
economic fallout of coronavirus. In a span of just hours, President Trump announced a 30-day
ban on most travel from Europe to the U.S., the National Basketball Association suspended its
season indefinitely, and an increasing number of colleges suspended in-person classes.
U.S. futures tied to all three stock indexes fell to their maximum allowed decline of 5% before
trading opened.
“We had so many things hitting us all at the same time,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment
officer of Exencial Wealth Advisors. “With so many larger organizations and larger pieces of the
economy now changing, it looks like life is going to be different for the next 30 or 60 days.”
“It’s hitting home now in a way that it wasn’t a few days ago,” he said.
Some investors were disappointed Mr. Trump didn’t clearly articulate details of how he
planned to get an economic stimulus package through Congress. Meanwhile, there was concern
about the lack of coordination between the federal government and the Federal Reserve.
“What you really need is confidence building,” said Hani Redha, a London-based multiasset
portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. “That comes from giving detailed

communication to the market about what they’re seeing and doing to develop the sense there’s
a comprehensive approach.”
Outside of the U.S., losses were broad. European equities also fell, with the Stoxx Europe 600
shedding 11.5%, its worst one-day performance on record.
The fall for all three U.S. indexes into bear market territory comes just weeks after they each
reached all-time-highs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both slid into a bear market after just 16
trading days.
Volatility has reverberated across the entire market, with U.S. Treasury yields and oil prices
also recently tumbling to historic lows. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury finished
Thursday at 0.842%, slightly up from the day before.
Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 7.2% to $33.22 a barrel, reflecting concerns about
lower demand for jet fuel and other types of energy.
Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index, a closely watched measure of volatility in the U.S. equity
market, rose to its highest level since 2008.
“Markets simply don’t know what the next steps are in terms of the virus spread,” said Edward
Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald. “We will see a dip in global growth
in Q1 and Q2 and all the fiscal stimulus out there can’t avoid that.”
The prospects for global growth have dimmed in recent weeks, and a number of major
multinational companies have said they expect their earnings to take a hit from the virus. The
IHS Markit also pared its forecast for this year to 1.7%, saying this week that it expects zero
growth in the eurozone, a contraction in Japan and expansion of just 4.3% in China this year.
Even with readjusted forecasts, much remains uncertain, especially after global health officials
declared the virus a pandemic on Wednesday.
On Wall Street, companies and exchanges are making contingency plans. The CME Group Inc.
said it will close its Chicago trading floor to preemptively avoid the spread of the virus. The New
York Stock Exchange is also preparing a contingency plan in case it needs to close its iconic
trading floor.

Markets are likely to remain volatile, Paul Sandhu, the Asia-Pacific head of multiasset quant
solutions and client advisory for BNP Paribas Asset Management in Hong Kong, said.
“The fear coming off from the coronavirus is going to be something that continues over the next
few weeks at least, “ he said.
