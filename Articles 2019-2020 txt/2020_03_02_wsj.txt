Dow Industrials Rally 5.1% on Central-Bank
Stimulus Hopes
Blue-chip index adds nearly 1,300 points in record point move as investors bet on lower interest rates
By Paul Vigna
Updated March 2,2020 530 pm ET
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from seven-session streak of declines with its
best day in more than a decade, lifted by investors' bets that central banks can stabilize markets
and shield e conomic growth from the impact of the coronavirus epidemic.
Monday's moves helped reverse some of the declines suffered last week—the worst for major
U.S. indexes since the financial crisis. Gains were broad-based, with all 11 sectors of the S&P 500
rising more than 2%. Apple and Microsoft surged, adding a combined $193 billion in market
value for the day, according to Factset data. U.S. oil prices posted their largest one-session
advance since mid-September.
The blue-chip index of 30 stocks surged 1293.96 points, or 5.1%, to 26703.32 in its biggest one-
day percentage gain since March 2009 and its biggest point advance on record. Other major
indexes posted their biggest one-day percentage gains since December 2018, with the S&P 500
rising 136.01 points, or 4.6% to 3090.23 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining 384.80
points, or 4.5%, to 8952.16.
Investors piled into wagers that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks may lower
interest rates, possibly in tandem to boost the firepower of stimulus efforts. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note plumbed new record lows, settling at 1.085%.
The gains came after U.S. stocks notched their worst week since the financial crisis, buffeted by
worries the spreading coronavirus will slow growth. Between late Friday and Monday, the Dow
industrials climbed 8.2% from Friday's intraday low in furious and sometimes erratic trading, a
frenzy some analysts said underscored how much information investors are trying to assess at
the same time.

Dow Industrials Rally 5.1% on Central-Bank Stimulus Hopes - WSJ
Since Sunday, there have been market-moving statements from key central banks, the World
Health Organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The rapid reversals sparked by reactions to all those headlines show a market under the sway of
“human emotions” as much as anything else, said Instinet executive director Frank Cappelleri.
“It changes by the hour,” Mr. Cappelleri said.
A volatile session began when stocks in Asia surged overnight after the Bank of Japan joined
the Fed in pledging to take action in response to the coronavirus epidemic. That prompted
Japan’s Nikkei 225 index to reverse early losses and close almost 1% higher. China’s Shanghai
Composite surged 3.1%, even after official purchasing managers’ indexes in China, released over
the weekend, plunged to record lows. These so-called PMI gauges cover factories and many
other parts of the economy including services and construction. A private gauge released on
Monday was similarly weak.
Echoing the BO J and Fed, a senior official at the European Central Bank later said the ECB could
take its interest rates further into negative territory and begin new bond purchases to support
the eurozone economy. The Stoxx Europe 600 swung several times before ending the session up
0.1%.
Tech stocks and banks rallied. Apple surged 9.3% to $298.81, Visa v 5.82% a gained 5.8% to
$192.33 and Microsoft added 6.7% to $172.79. The S&P 500 financial sector posted its biggest
one-day gain since November 2011. Citigroup c 6.51% a r0se 6.5% to $67.59, and JPMorgan
Chase JPM 4.66% a climbed 4.7% to $121.52.
Fears about the fallout from the virus haven’t dissipated. Monday’s gains were led by utilities,
consumer staples and real-estate stocks, all sectors investors tend to buy when they are
nervous. Costco Wholesale cost 9.96% a climbed 10% to $309.14 and Walmart WMT7.62% a rose
7.6% to $115.88, with investors expecting both retailers to receive a boost from shoppers
stocking up.
Some of the stocks most closely lashed to fears about the epidemic’s effect were still down.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings nclh -4.48% y fell 4.5% to $35.59, Carnival lost 1.2% to $33.06.
American Airlines aal-i.oo% t dropped 1% to $18.86 and United Airlines slipped 0.5% to $61.26.
That is a sign some investors still doubt central banks can do much to alleviate the pressure on
economic growth and financial markets, especially if the virus spreads into major centers of
economic activity such as New York and London, some analysts said.

“If the central banks intervene, that is great and I appreciate that, but will this fix the
problem?” asked Andrea Carzana, an equity fund manager for Columbia Threadneedle
Investments. “If companies need to shut down because of the virus, it doesn’t really matter how
much liquidity you put into the system,” he said, while adding that lower borrowing costs could
help heavily indebted businesses that need to refinance.
Shares of health insurers also surged in afternoon trading after reports that Sen. Amy
Klobuchar and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg will endorse former Vice
President Joe Biden, moves that could obstruct Sen. Bernie Sanders’ path to the Democratic
presidential nomination.
Mr. Sanders’ proposed overhaul of the health-care system has been seen as a threat to shares of
insurers. Humana hum 8.03% a rose 8% to $345.36, while CVS Health cvs 8.20% a gained 8.2% to
$64.03 and Anthem, Cigna ci 6.23% a and UnitedHealth unh 7.12% a all gained 5.5% or more.

Even if the market goes down from here, investors can see an eventual end to the crisis, said
Edward Moya, senior market analyst at New York brokerage Oanda.
“It’s too good of a price to pass up,” he said.
