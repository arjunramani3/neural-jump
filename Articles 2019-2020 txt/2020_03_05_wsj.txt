Stocks Close Sharply Lower as Anxiety
About Virus Returns
Yield on 10-year Treasury note remains below 1%, signaling investors' concerns about growth

U.S. stocks tumbled and bond yields dropped to fresh lows, continuing a painful stretch of
market turbulence as investors around the world remain jittery about the economic fallout
from the coronavirus outbreak.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 970 points, or 3.6%, erasing much of the gains
notched Wednesday as losses accelerated midday. As investors fled stocks, the rush for
traditionally safer assets continued, sending Treasury yields falling and mortgage rates to a
record low.
Thursday’s moves continued what has been a dizzying week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 has
risen or fallen at least 2% for four consecutive sessions, the longest such stretch since August
2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data, when the European debt crisis rocked markets.
Some investors said they expected the stock gyrations to continue, with much uncertain about
how far the coronavirus will spread.
“We are all dealing with an unknown,” said Stephen Lee, founding principal at Logan Capital
Management. “It’s testing a lot of businesses.”
The number of canceled conferences and travel has continued to rise as the virus has spread,
crimping business activity and spending while roiling the outlook for global growth this year.
Investors and analysts have slashed their outlooks for corporate profits this year. Many have
been worried that the virus will harm consumer sentiment and business investment, though
the true ramifications of the sickness remain unclear.

High-Speed Trains, International Flights: How the Coronavirus Spread
All 11 of the S&P 500’s sectors fell in afternoon trading, sending the broader gauge 3.4% lower.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1%.
All three major indexes are still on track for weekly gains of about 2%. That’s partly thanks to a
dramatic rally Wednesday after a strong Super Tuesday performance by former Vice President
Joe Biden drove big gains in shares of health insurers.
The wild swings in the stock market have been a wake-up call for many investors after years of
steadily climbing markets.
"For years it was ‘buy the dip’, ‘buy the dip’, ‘buy the dip,”’ said JJ Kinahan, chief market
strategist at TD Ameritrade. ‘‘It’s very unsettling for people to see these kinds of moves every
day.”
Investors are analyzing economic data for any signs of wilting growth. Data on Thursday
showed that U.S. factory orders fell in January. New orders for manufactured goods decreased
0.5%, the Commerce department said, more than what economists surveyed by The Wall Street
Journal had expected.
On Friday, investors will be parsing the monthly jobs report to see if U.S. hiring remained
strong in February. The number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits
fell last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, suggesting anxiety about the spread of the
coronavirus hasn’t yet affected layoffs.
In one warning sign, some of the recent stock declines suggest that investors are skeptical of
how much the Federal Reserve and U.S. lawmakers can contain the negative effects of the virus.
The Federal Reserve executed an emergency half-percentage-point rate cut earlier this week,
its first such rate change since the 2008 financial crisis. However, stocks fell after the

announcement. Investors are betting on more interest-rate cuts later this year, CME Group data
show.
“You can cut rates to zero and the virus could continue to spread,” said Amy Kong, chief
investment officer at Barrett Asset Management. “They can’t control the virus.”
As stocks fell, investors sought the relative safety of government bonds, pushing the yield on
the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note down to 0.904%, from 0.994% at Wednesday’s close.
Yields fall as bond prices rise.
The falling yields have wide-ranging effects on borrowing costs and bank profitability. Shares of
financial companies were some of the hardest hit in Thursday’s market as falling yields can
crimp profits for big banks. Meanwhile, mortgage rates fell to their lowest level on record
Thursday.
Markets are likely to keep swinging, said Olivier d’Assier, head of applied research for the Asia-
Pacific region at financial analytics firm Qontigo.
“We are going to be stuck in this for a while” Mr. d’Assier said. “You’ve got short-term traders
buying on the stimulus and then you have medium- and long-term investors de-risking.”
Travel and leisure stocks continued to take a beating. The Dow Jones Transportation Average—
which tracks the performance of 20 large U.S. airlines, truckers, railroads and shippers—fell
4.9%.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings fell about 12%, while Royal Caribbean Cruises dropped 15% as
travelers continue to back out of planned cruises because of virus fears. American Airlines
retreated 11%. Alaska Air fell 12% and was on track to close at its lowest level since at least
October 2014. Caesars Entertainment was on track for its longest losing streak since October
2016.

European stocks also dropped, with the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index down 1.4%,
with aerospace and defense companies were among the hardest hit. In contrast, most Asian
markets rose Thursday, with the Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
both closing up about 2%.
In commodities markets, Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 2.2% to $49.99 a barrel.
OPEC has reached a preliminary agreement to cut crude output amid a global glut and eroding
demand, The Wall Street Journal reported. The collective plan, in response to the virus
outbreak, still needs to be approved by Russia.
