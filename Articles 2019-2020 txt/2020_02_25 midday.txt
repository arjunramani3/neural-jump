A rout in global financial markets deepened Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average
down nearly 600 points and Treasury yields sliding to fresh lows.

For much of the past several weeks, investors have been fixated on one issue: the potential for a
growing coronavirus epidemic to hit economic activity around the world.
Hope that health officials would be able to contain the epidemic, resulting in only a short-term
disruption to economic activity, had helped keep stocks near all-time highs up until just last
week. But in the past few days, that optimism has increasingly turned into skepticism—sending
stocks, oil prices and bond yields sliding.
Tuesday’s selling accelerated after reports showed the disease had spread even further, with
countries from Switzerland to Austria to South Korea reporting new infections.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 579 points, or 2.1%, to 27382. The S&P 500 fell 1.9%
and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7%.
Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note—used as a reference rate for
everything from mortgages to student loans—fell to 1.319%, trading around a record low.

according to Tradeweb.
“The size of this economic shock is looking increasingly large on a global scale,” said James
Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “What we’re just
seeing here is the crack in that sentiment-driven equity rally.”
Among the biggest decliners in the stock market Tuesday: shares of companies whose profits
are vulnerable to slowdowns in consumer spending and travel.
Bank stocks retreated, with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America all down at least
2%. The continued slide in long-term bond yields threatens to cut into banks’ lending
profitability.
Energy shares also tumbled. The S&P 500 energy sector is trading down 18% for the year, hurt
by fears that a slowdown in global economic activity will drag oil prices lower.
Meanwhile, traders placed bets on further volatility. The Cboe Volatility Index, which tracks
expectations for swings in the S&P 500, jumped 8.8% to bring its year-to-date gain to 98%.
“I just don’t think we can accept the numbers coming out of China at face value,” said Mark
Grant, managing director and chief global strategist at B. Riley FBR.
With little clarity on the severity of the epidemic, as well as uncertainty about if officials will be
able to effectively contain it, Mr. Grant said he wouldn’t be surprised if there was further
volatility across markets.
Investors had largely begun the year with hopes that the global economy would stabilize given
a cooling of trade tensions between the U.S. and China and central banks’ willingness to hold
interest rates at low levels.
But the coronavirus epidemic is throwing into question many firms’ projections for growth,
raising the possibility of a longer-term disruption to economic activity.
The head of the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that the fund was downgrading its
global-growth projections, as well as trying to figure out if the economic fallout stemming from
the epidemic would primarily occur in the first quarter of the year.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 ended down 1.8%, closing out its worst four-day stretch since
2016, after having fallen more than 3% Monday.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6%, while Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average, which was
closed Monday, fell 3.3%.

“This vims doesn’t respect borders. There’s no real reason to expect it’s going to be easy to
contain,” said Jan Lambregts, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank. “The real
economic impact of this is going to be felt.”
