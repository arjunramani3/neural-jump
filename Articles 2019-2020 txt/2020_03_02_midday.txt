Dow Industrials, S&P 500 Climb on
Stimulus Hopes
U.S. indexes rise more than 2% as Bank of Japan joins Fed in pledging to take action if needed.

Stocks shot higher while U.S. government bond yields hit new lows Monday, with investors
hoping central banks can stabilize markets and shield economic growth from the impact of the
coronavirus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 785 points, or 3.1%, to 26192, after wild swings that had
it trading briefly in the red. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.8%.
Investors piled into wagers that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks may lower
interest rates, possibly in tandem to boost the firepower of stimulus efforts. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note plumbed new lows, falling as low as 1.031% overnight,
from 1.127% Friday. Most recently it was at 1.072%.
U.S. stocks notched their worst week since the financial crisis Friday, buffeted by worries the
spreading coronavirus will slow growth. Late Monday morning, the Dow industrials had
climbed more than 4.5% from Friday’s intraday low.
Monday’s moves suggested a market under the sway of “human emotions” as much as anything
else, said Instinet executive director Frank Cappelleri.
“It changes by the hour,” Mr. Cappelleri said.
Stocks across markets surged overnight after the Bank of Japan joined the Federal Reserve in
pledging to take action in response to the coronavirus epidemic. Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda’s
comments prompted bets that central banks could take coordinated steps to ease the strain on
financial markets following last week’s rout.
That prompted Japan’s Nikkei 225 index to reverse early losses and close almost 1% higher.

Dow Industrials, S&P 500 Climb on Stimulus Hopes - WSJ
Echoing the BO J and Federal Reserve, a senior official at the European Central Bank later said
the ECB could take its interest rates further into negative territory and begin new bond
purchases to support the eurozone economy.
Sentiment soured on European equities and U.S. stock futures, however, after the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Monday that the global economy is likely
to slow markedly this year. In its “best case” scenario, the world economy will expand by 2.4%
in 2020, down from its 2.9% forecast from before the start of the epidemic, the Paris-based
research body said.
After trading opened in New York, the Institute for Supply Management released its February
manufacturing index, which fell to 50.1 from 50.9 in January. That level reflects an industry that
is on the cusp of contraction. The S&P 500 fell into the red before moving back into positive
territory.
The choppiness in equities reflects the “general financial-market fragility right now,” said
Candice Bangsund, a portfolio manager at Fiera Capital. “Investors remain highly uncertain in
regard to the economic fallout and the extent and the magnitude of the outbreak in general.”
In Italy, among the countries worst-affected by the virus outside China, the FTSE MIB stock
index dropped 1.7%. The regional Stoxx 600 added 0.2%.
In China, the Shanghai Composite surged 3.2%, even after official purchasing managers’ indexes
in China, released over the weekend, plunged to record lows. These so-called PMI gauges cover
factories and many other parts of the economy including services and construction. A private
gauge released on Monday was similarly weak.
The weak data has bolstered expectations for monetary easing from the People’s Bank of China,
and maybe for fiscal measures such as tax cuts, according to Jingyi Pan, Asia market strategist
atIG.
Brent-crude futures, which have slumped in response to a fall in demand for jet fuel and other
forms of oil, rose 2.5% to $50.94 a barrel.
