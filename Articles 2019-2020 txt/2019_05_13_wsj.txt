Trade Anxiety
Dow drops more than 600 after China says it will raise tariffs on some U.S. imports
By Akane Otani

Stocks posted their biggest drop in months Monday after officials in Beijing and the White
House exchanged fresh threats in a trade fight that many observers fear could crimp growth.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 617.38 points, or 2.4%, to 25324.99 and the S&P 500
dropped 69.53 points, or 2.4%, to 2811.87, with both indexes posting their biggest one-day losses
since Jan. 3. The Nasdaq Composite declined 269.92 points, or 3.4%, to 7647.02 in its worst
showing since December.
The moves showed investors that one of the biggest assumptions many had held this year could
be in danger of falling apart. Many money managers had credited the stock market’s 2019 rally
to a combination of easy monetary policy, steady growth in the U.S. and signs of progress in
trade negotiations.
There is still time for the U.S. and China to carve out a trade agreement, analysts said, noting
the two countries’ increased tariffs won’t hit goods in transit immediately. And U.S. indexes are
still up solidly for the year: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up by double-digit percentages in 2019,
rebounding from a fourth-quarter rout. Stocks pared some of Monday’s losses after President
Trump said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the coming G-20 summit.

Still, investors and analysts say a breakdown of trade talks risks damaging business and
consumer confidence, potentially crimping spending at a time when growth is already widely
expected to moderate.

UBS analysts estimate U.S. growth could drop by 0.75 to 1 percentage point and stocks could fall
by double-digit percentages if the U.S. hits all Chinese exports with 25% tariffs.
“This back and forth that we’re seeing on trade is a distraction,” said Alan Adelman, senior
fund manager and research analyst at Frost Investment Advisors.
So far, corporate earnings in the U.S. have proven better than feared, helping share prices rise
off the lows they hit last year.
But Mr. Adelman said he would be closely watching earnings “for any signs that trade is
starting to translate” into poorer results.
Shares of manufacturers and chip makers slid anew, extending a slide from late last week.
Heavy machinery maker Caterpillar fell $6.04, or 4.6%, to $125.30, while Boeing lost $17.30, or
4.9%, to $337.37 and memory-chip maker Micron Technology shed $1.56, or 4%, to $37.38. The
group has been sensitive to developments on trade, especially because many analysts believe
its profits are closely tied to global growth and demand from China.
iPhone maker Apple, which assembles almost all of its goods in China, slid $11.46, or 5.8%, to
$185.72.
Major indexes have made a sharp retreat from records as trade tensions between the world’s
two biggest economies have ratcheted higher. Chinese officials said Monday that they would
raise tariffs on roughly $60 billion worth of U.S. imports, following through on threats last week
to hit back at the U.S. after its own increase in tariffs went into effect.
The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization companies, which tends to be especially
sensitive to U.S. growth prospects, lost 3.2%.
Meanwhile, shares of ride-hailing app Uber Technologies slumped $4.47, or 11%, to $37.10,
extending declines after tumbling in its public markets debut Friday. The stock ended Monday
18% below its initial-public-offering price of $45.
As stocks swung lower, analysts said it is difficult to pinpoint when calm will return to the
markets.
There are many other issues around global trade that could spur volatility, said Neil Dwane,
global strategist at Allianz Global Investors. He cited a U.S. deal with Japan that could be signed
next month and trade relations between the U.S. and Europe, which could weigh on the German
car industry and French agriculture.
Others said further escalation in trade tensions could dent growth to the point where central
banks consider taking additional steps to ease monetary policy.

“The question is, are trade tensions easing, are central banks responding by cutting rates, and
are the economic data deteriorating or not,” said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager for the
global multiasset group at OppenheimerFunds.
As uncertainty lingered, traders bet on the volatile streak in markets continuing. The Cboe
Volatility Index, or VIX, which tracks expectations for stock swings, soared 28%—its biggest
one-day increase since October. The VIX tends to rise when stocks fall, and its recent increase is
yet another sign that investors are gearing up for bigger swings ahead.
Stock indexes outside of the U.S. also came under selling pressure, with the Stoxx Europe 600
and Shanghai Composite losing 1.2% apiece.
Later this week, investors will be watching for reports on U.S. retail sales, as well as housing
starts.
The bond market flashed fresh warning signs about growth Monday, with the yield on the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly sliding below 2.400% from 2.455% Friday. Yields,
which fall as bond prices rise, tend to decline when investors are less optimistic about the
economic outlook.
The spread between short- and longer-term government bond yields also narrowed further,
with three-month Treasurys ending Monday yielding more than 10-year Treasurys.
Analysts have looked at the so-called yield curve with caution because shorter-term Treasurys
have often yielded more than longer-term ones before the economy has slipped into recession.
