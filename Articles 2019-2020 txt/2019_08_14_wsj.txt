Dow Sheds 800 in Biggest Drop of Year
Plunge in stocks, bond yields sends fresh recession signals

The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its largest decline this year and government-bond
markets sent a fresh warning about the risk of a coming recession, highlighting anxiety on Wall
Street about the prospects for the decadelong economic expansion.
The Dow industrials slumped 800.49 points, or 3%, to 25479.42, led by sharp declines in
economically sensitive industries such as banking and manufacturing. Citigroup, one of the
most internationally active U.S. banks, dropped 5.3%, while Boeing, the airline giant and export
powerhouse, slipped 3.7%, putting it in negative territory for the year.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How concerned are you about a recession hitting the U.S. within the next two years? Join the
conversation below.
Weak data out of Germany and China exacerbated fears that the biggest economies around the
world, which less than two years ago were growing in sync, are now struggling as the effects of
the trade war become more pronounced. Traders now fear those woes could spill over to the
U.S.
The worries spurred investors to rush to the relative safety of U.S. bonds, which still offer some
of the best yields among developed countries despite their recent drop. As the demand pushed
up long-term bond prices, yields on the 10-year Treasury note briefly fell below two-year yields

for the first time since 2007. That inversion between short and long-term yields is viewed by
many as a signal that a recession is looming.
“Whether we go into recession now or we don’t, it’s not a good sign,” said Michael Farr,
president of investment firm Farr, Miller & Washington. “You’re going to see investors
temper their enthusiasm more seriously today.”
The yield-curve inversion spooked investors, but some money managers cautioned that a
recession or prolonged stock-market downturn isn’t necessarily imminent. With bond yields at
multi-year lows, many investors say there are no good alternatives to U.S. stocks for those
seeking returns. The S&P 500 sports a dividend yield of roughly 2%, well above the 1.596% yield
on the 10-year Treasury note.
Markets also tend to keep moving higher immediately following a yield-curve inversion. Since
1978, the S&P 500 has risen 13%, on average, from the first time the spread inverts on a closing
basis to the beginning of a recession, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
Mr. Farr said in this tumultuous environment, investors need to make sure that the companies
they own have strong balance sheets cash flow, without much debt. He added he likes
companies that tend to do well even if the economy sputters, like Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo
and Johnson & Johnson.
The declines in U.S. stocks and bond yields erased the optimism sparked a day earlier when the
Trump administration abruptly suspended plans to impose new tariffs on goods from China
and suggest the volatile swings that have defined trading in August are showing no signs of
easing.
The S&P 500 declined 85.72 points, or 2.9%, to 2840.60, while the Nasdaq Composite lost
242.42, or 3%, to 7773.94.
In the Treasury market, the yield on the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond touched 2.018%, according
to Tradeweb, below the previous intraday low of 2.094% in July 2016. The 30-year is the longest
type of U.S. government debt and one of the most sensitive to changes in expectations for long-
term growth and inflation.
This latest yield-curve inversion is particularly concerning to some investors given it comes on
the heels of the Fed cutting short-term rates last month. Many traders and analysts are now
looking for additional intervention by the Fed to extend the economic expansion in the U.S.
President Trump called out the Fed in a tweet Wednesday afternoon, saying the central bank
raised interest rates too quickly and is now too slow to cut.

Expectations for further rate cuts jumped Wednesday, with Fed-funds futures showing a
market-implied probability of nearly 20% that the central bank cuts rates by 50 basis points in
September, up from 4% a day ago.
“The Fed doesn’t have the cure for an economic slowdown or recession,” said Kristina Hooper,
chief global market strategist at Invesco. “But I do think the Fed has the antidote for the stock-
market selloff.”
Market swings tend to be exaggerated when trading is slow. Stock- and bond- trading
volumes have been lower than normal this

“Volumes are actually not that prevalent at the
moment because yesterday the market did the
opposite, so people are at a standstill position,”
said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETF trading
solutions at broker WallachBeth Capital LLC.
“We’ll see what happens in September when
people are back from vacation.”
Elsewhere, European stocks fell after data
showed the German economy shrank in the second quarter. The Stoxx Europe 600 dropped
1.7%, while the German DAX fell 2.2%.
Germany’s economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter due to further declines in exports,
and the latest data mean that average quarterly growth has been zero since the third quarter of
2018, according to ING.
The data put pressure on the German government to stimulate the economy through tax cuts or
public spending, and the yield on the 10-year German bund touched a fresh record low of minus
0.645%, according to Tradeweb.
The debilitating effect of trade tensions also was visible in Chinese data, as value-added
industrial production in the country grew 4.8% in July, significantly lower than the 6.3%
increase in June and below expectations of 5.9% growth.
Still, Asian stocks rallied on the tariff delay, with shares in Shanghai up 0.4% and Japan’s Nikkei
up 1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added nearly 0.1% as the city continued to struggle with protests
and violence.
