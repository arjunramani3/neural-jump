Stocks soared in frenetic trading Tuesday, wiping out much of the losses they suffered just a
day earlier in their biggest selloff since the financial crisis.
The market opened sharply higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring nearly 1,000
points within the first few minutes of the opening bell. Stocks then erased the entirety of their
gains before midday, only to charge higher again in the final hours of trading.

To many analysts, the turbulent moves of the past few days suggest that riskier assets are still
in the midst of a tenuous recovery that could take days to fully unfold—or ultimately wind up
falling apart.
The S&P 500 rose 135.67 points, or 4.9%, to 2882.23. At its lowest point Tuesday, the index was
just 0.9% away from ending an 11-year bull market run that overcame issues ranging from a
global trade war to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S.’s credit rating.
The Dow industrials, which at one point sat just 0.2% away from a bear market—a 20% drop
from a recent high—closed up 1167.14 points, or 4.9%, to 25018.16. The Nasdaq Composite was
up 393.58 points, or 5%, to 8344.25.

Investors took some comfort from government officials’ plans to help offset an anticipated
slowdown in economic activity due to the coronavirus epidemic: White House officials are
considering potential measures including a payroll-tax cut and help for hourly wage earners,
while Japan’s government unveiled a multibillion-dollar plan to help businesses that have been
affected by the coronavirus.
But many warn those measures may not be enough to ease investors’ anxieties, especially with
health officials suggesting the number of coronavirus cases is likely to continue rising around
the world.
“The markets at the moment are very volatile, very broken,” said Sergey Dergachev, a portfolio
manager at Union Investment. “The market participants are very nervous, so every headline or
signal provided by central banks and politicians and Trump provides some small relief.”
Within the stock market, sectors that had been hit the hardest in recent days were among the
biggest gainers Tuesday.
Airline stocks soared after companies announced they’d cut more flights in domestic and
international markets, freeze hiring and park planes as a result of reduced demand. United
Airlines Holdings shares jumped $5.78, or 12%, to $52.56, while American Airlines Group added
$2.25, or 15%, to $17.
Shares of energy companies rose so quickly after the opening bell that exchanges briefly halted
trading in a few stocks. Single-stock circuit breakers are activated when shares move up or
down more than certain thresholds within a five-minute period.
After resuming trading, Apache shares added $1.24, or 13%, to $10.79, while Occidental
Petroleum, which cut its quarterly dividend and said it would reduce its capital spending in
2020, rose $1.83, or 15%, to $14.34.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 ended down 1.1%, erasing the entirety of its rally from earlier
in the session. Analysts have been worried about the potential for the coronavirus to cause
more economic disruption on the continent. Italy placed its entire national territory under
quarantine, the most dramatic step by any country so far to contain the epidemic.
“The whole of Italy has been locked down,” said Benjamin Schroeder, a rates strategist at ING.
“If that becomes the norm in Europe, that too could probably trigger a new test of these levels.”
In the Asia-Pacific region, the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.8% and Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng added 1.4%.
In China, President Xi Jinpingarrived in Wuhan for a surprise visit. This was his first trip to the
epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic since the health crisis began, and comes as China reports

a steep decline in the number of new cases.
“President Xi’s trip to Wuhan is declaring China has largely brought the coronavirus under
control,” said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities.
Mr. Pang said that in turn had helped shore up investor confidence in China’s economic outlook.
