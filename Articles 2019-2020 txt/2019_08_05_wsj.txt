Stocks Fall Sharply as Yuan Reels and
Trump Jabs at China
Dow, S&P, Nasdaq slide; Trump accuses China of engaging in currency manipulation.

Waves of selling battered stock indexes from New York to Shanghai on Monday as fresh trade
threats between Beijing and Washington raised fears of an economic slowdown.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 767.27 points, or 2.9%, to 25717.74, notching its biggest
one-day percentage drop since December. The S&P 500 shed 3% to 2844.74 and the Nasdaq
Composite declined 3.5% to 7726.04. All three major U.S. indexes are now virtually even with
where they were a year ago.
Among the biggest stock-market decliners Monday were shares of industrial and technology
companies that rely on global trade. Caterpillar fell 2.3%, while Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple
and Google parent Alphabet each fell more than 3%.
Traders also bet on more stock swings ahead, sending the Cboe Volatility Index soaring 40%—
its biggest one-day increase since October.
The stock-market declines, which have extended for six straight sessions, shaving 6% off the
S&P 500 during that span, began last week after President Trump said he would extend tariffs
to almost all Chinese imports. Selling accelerated Monday after the Chinese yuan dropped
beyond the level of seven to the dollar, with local officials blaming the depreciation on Mr.
Trump’s decision on tariffs. Mr. Trump responded on Twitter, accusing China of engaging in
currency manipulation.
The back-and-forth dealt a blow to hopes the two countries would ultimately reach a trade
agreement, forcing investors to rethink assumptions that had helped stocks climb to records

Readers Weigh In
How concerned are you about this trade fight? Are you making adjustments
to your investments? Join the conversation below.
“Trump	is the first	U.S. President to stand
in China’s way and because of it, China's
tactics have grown even nastier. This could
really tank the markets for a long time and
could conceivably cost Trump the election
next year I stopped buying stocks in March
and have shifted to a slightly more
defensive posture. I’ll keep cash until there
is more clarity on trade and on the
elections. ” —Mark Holland
this year.
In one sign of mounting pessimism, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note-
used to help set borrowing costs for consumers and businesses around the world—fell from
1.864% Friday to 1.738% Monday, its lowest yield since October 2016. Yields fall as investors buy
bonds, which typically happens when they are seeking relatively safe assets.
The downward lurch in yields, which can crimp profits of financial firms, hammered bank
stocks. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index lost 3.6%; Bank of America fell more than 4%.

Despite the recent market downdraft, stocks remain up solidly in 2019. The S&P 500 is up 13%,
about 6% below its July 26 record, and is outperforming the Stoxx Europe 600, Nikkei Stock
Average, Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index.
But worries about the conflict have weighed on global growth. The trade fight also has had an
impact on the U.S., where growth and consumer spending remain strong: The Federal Reserve
last week cut interest rates for the first time since 2008, in part to cushion the economy against
what it sees as rising financial risks.
“Global stocks had been priced for perfection," said Kenny Polcari, managing principal at
Butcher Joseph Asset Management. “Now people are realizing we may not get a deal."
Fears of the trade fight intensifying amplified bets on the Fed lowering interest rates
multiple times by year-end. Federal-funds futures, used by traders to place bets on the
course of monetary policy, reflected a roughly 41% probability of at least three more quarter-
point rate cuts in 2019, according to CME Group. That is up from 8.2% one month ago.
“I think it's fair to say that if the markets soften further, the Fed might react to that," said Craig
Birk, chief investment officer at Personal Capital.
At the same time, Mr. Birk cautioned against trying to make short-term bets based on the U.S.-
China trade fight. In past months, U.S. officials had suggested the two countries were close to a
deal. Now, “it seems like things are actually regressing," Mr. Birk said.
Earlier, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index
fell nearly 3% as a citywide strike
disrupted the airport and subway
services. It followed a ninth weekend
of protests against a controversial
extradition bill and China's growing
influence on the city.
In a speech Monday, Hong Kong's
leader Carrie Lam said society has
become dangerous and unstable. The
city's stock market has fallen 9% in
the past few weeks as the protests dent business sentiment and weigh on economic growth.
The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 2.3% to its lowest level since May, while Japan's Nikkei Stock Average
ended down 1.7%.
