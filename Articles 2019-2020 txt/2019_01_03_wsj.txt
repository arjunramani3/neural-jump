U.S. Stocks Close Sharply Lower After Weak
Economic Data, Apple Warning
Dow industrials fall 2.8% while S&P declines 2.5%; Apple shares drop 10%

U.S. stocks tumbled Thursday, as weak economic data and a rare sales warning from Apple
sparked fresh worries among investors about a global slowdown.
A confluence of factors from the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy to renewed U.S.-China trade
tensions have weighed down financial markets in recent weeks. Adding to investors’ fears,
manufacturing data around the world have pointed to slowing momentum.
“The volatility we’re seeing in the stock market is clearly sending us a signal that growth is
likely to slow over the coming months,” said David Spika, president of GuideStone Capital
Management, which has $13 billion in assets under management. “This is a legitimate reaction
to what’s going on in the economy.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 660.02 points, or 2.8%, to 22686.22, ending near its
low for the day, while the S&P 500 fell 62.14 points, or 2.5%, to 2447.89. The technology-heavy
Nasdaq Composite snapped a five-day winning streak, shedding 202.43 points, or 3%, to
6463.50.
With Thursday’s losses, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 notched their worst two-day start to a
year since 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
Selling accelerated early in the day after data showed a deceleration in U.S. factory activity in
December. That followed a report earlier this week that showed China’s manufacturing activity
contracted last month for the first time since May 2017.

Worries about growth pushed bond prices sharply higher, with the yield on 10-year U.S.
Treasury note dropping to 2.557% from 2.659% Wednesday. Bond yields fall as prices rise. Other
so-called havens also rose, with gold picking up 0.8% at $1291.80 per troy ounce and the
Japanese yen rallying against the U.S. dollar.
Meanwhile, technology shares slumped, with Apple ending the day as the worst performer in
the Dow industrials. The iPhone maker, which lowered its quarterly revenue forecast for the
first time in more than 15 years Wednesday, erased $74.6 billion in market value Thursday.
Shares of the tech giant fell $15.73, or 10%, to $142.19.
The stock market is trying to decipher whether companies are starting to curtail production
plans due to slowing demand, said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth
Management.
“The slowdown in global growth isn’t new news, but what is a source of concern for investors is
whether things are slowing more quickly than we thought and if that is starting to impact
companies’ future plans,” Mr. Freedman said. “That probably hasn’t been fully priced in yet.”
The recent tumult across markets has pushed some investors to bet on the Fed pausing its
interest-rate increases or even cutting rates this year. That could help ease the fears of those
who worried that a too-aggressive Fed could curtail the stock rally.
Yet some analysts say the stock rout shows investors remain worried about the prospects
for U.S. growth.

“Investors fear that the damage has already been done,” said Michael Arone, chief investment
strategist at State Street Global Advisors, referring to concerns that tighter monetary

conditions and the U.S.-China trade dispute have contributed to slower economic growth.
“Until we find some stabilization in earnings or economic data, these concerns are going to
continue to swell.”
Nine of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 fell Thursday, with the technology sector shedding 5.1%.
Other popular tech stocks such as Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet fell at least 2.5%
apiece. Meanwhile, dividend-paying sectors that investors typically buy when they are nervous
rose, with the utilities and real-estate groups ending higher.
Investors will get another snapshot on the health of the U.S. economy when the Labor
Department releases its December employment report Friday. Following the jobs data. Fed
Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak about monetary policy at the American
Economic Association in Atlanta. The panel will also include former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and
Ben Bernanke.
Friday’s jobs report would need to signal that the Goldilocks economy is continuing, running
neither too hot nor too cold. If wages accelerate too quickly, that will likely make investors fret
that inflation is picking up and the Fed would need to continue to lift borrowing costs to
prevent an overheating economy, Mr. Arone said.
A weaker-than-expected reading in the number of jobs created last month could add to fears
that U.S. economic growth has peaked, he added.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1%. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.3% and
China’s Shanghai Composite Index lost less than 0.1%.
