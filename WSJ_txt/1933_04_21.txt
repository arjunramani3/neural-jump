Friday, on the New York Stock Exchange. 173 stocks made new highs and seven stocks made new lows, for the year 1933.
Stocks covered a good deal of ground yesterday, and were subjected to heavy profit-taking at intervals. Railroad shares managed to hold some of their spectacular gains, scored at the opening, but utilities and industrials dropped generally lower. Some of the sensational performers recently lost fairly heavily, but the losses were not large in comparison with the wide gains scored in the last few sessions.
While the Dow-Jones railroad average finished higher on the day, it failed to break through the trading area top, set on November 12. At the finish, the rail average stood at 29.5, more than a full point under the November 12 high.
The feature of the securities markets was the action of domestic corporation bonds. High grade bonds, which have been weak, turned up decisively, and speculative rail bonds ran up sharply.
Northwest Ronda Traffic Spurts
Traffic on some of the northwestern carriers has taken quite a spurt so far in April, and one major reason for it is improved grain loadings, due to the higher prices. Among the beneficiaries of the higher grain movement have been the Great Northern, Northern Pacific, Chicago & North Western and the St. Paul. The latter two, also, have been getting quite a slice of the beer traffic, with the St. Paul handling roughly 100 cars of beer a day.
For the year to April IS, loadings of the St. Paul were 17^% below the like period of 1932 For the first 18 days of April, loadings were down less than 7% from the similar period of 1932, and there has been s steady day to day improvement recently. Grain loadings in the first 18 days of April were about 30% above the like days of 1932.
The Northern Pacific’s improvement has been marked, too. Early in the year, traffic was about 25% behind 1932, and now it is running around 7^ % below the 1932 level. Grain loadings in the first two weeks of April were around 60% of the like period of 1932. North Western’s traffic is only about 8% under the 1932 level, compared with between 20% and 30ri early in the year.
Chrysler’s First Quarter Report
The report of Chrysler Corp, for the first quarter of 1933 was more favorable than might have been anticipated, in view of the difficulties of the period. While the net loss for the three months was reported at $3,038,082, against $2,056,485 for the corresponding months of 1932, the bare figures do not tell the whole story.
In the latest quarter, deductions for interest amounted to $2,251,874, compared with $730,262 for the similar period of 1932. While the company does not discuss the item fully, the increase apparently was due entirely to a deduction to set up additional reserves. If that item had been eliminated, the company’s loss for the quarter would have been considerably less than for the similar period of 1932.
The company’s current position at the end of the quarter still was good, but the reduction in cash showed the effects of banking troubles on Chrysler. At the close of the period, the company had $6,250,504 in cash in closed or restricted banks.
The General Motors report, which will make its appearance shortly, also will show that that corporation suffered some reduction in its cash holdings as result of bank closings. Motors was one of the big depositors in the two important Detroit banking groups, whose troubles precipitated the banking panic. General Motors, too, underwrote the $12,500,000 issue of common stock necessary to create a new bank in Detroit, and the corporation’s cash position at the end of the first quarter may reflect this operation.
The Steel Capacity Decline
The annual steel ingot capacity of the country slipped off 99,780 tons at tbe end of lost year from the close of the previous year, the first drop since compilation of figures on the industry was begun. Fig iron and ferro metal capacity also was down fairly substantially from the previous year-end.
The drop in ingot capacity for the industry as a whole was not as substantial as the decline in the capacity of the United States Steel Corp, alone. While the industry’s capacity was down only 99,780 tons, the Steel Corp.’s ingot capacity was off 499,400 tons at the end of 1932. The drop In the corporation’s pig iron and ferro metal capacity accounted for about 60% ot the decline of the industry as a whole. The corporation’s annual capacity dropped 737,800 tons, against 1,284,200 for the industry.
Turnabout for Louisville & Nashville
While the first two months of the year are no fair criterion of what the year’s results for Louisville & Nashville will be, they show how dramatically the railroad’s position has improved. Before the speculative fever gripped the securities markets, there was sound basis for buying Louisville & Nashville on the basis of the definite improvements in its earnings.
For the two months ended February, Louisville & Nashville reported net Income equal to 17 cents a share. In the first two months of 1932 the road had a not loss of $1,171,211. Traffic in tbe two months picked up sharply, due largely to nn Improvement in coal movement as result of colder weather. General traffic, too, picked up.
Louisville Sc Nashville’s March report will not make as good reading as that for the first two months, and it is questionable whether the road will show any net Income for the first quarter. Such a showing, however, should not be ppMtUng to tbe xoed's seeuEU^ hcldeis, Xor
