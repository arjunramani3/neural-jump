With the selling frantic from the start, the Dow industrials sank more than 300 points within minutes of the opening bell. Every one of the 30 members of the Dow industrials finished the session lower, replicating their performance of Monday's Nasdaq-led market rout.
Some investors were buying technology stocks as their prices fell, which helped insulate the Nasdaq composite from the heavier declines that hit the Dow industrials and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which fell 2.58%. One faint consolation for technology investors: The Nasdaq's finish of 1972.09 was above the 1923.38 close of Monday, when that index fell 6.3%. Yesterday's point drop in the Dow industrials, by contrast, was the 10th-largest in the index's history, though in percentage terms, which most investors consider the more relevant comparison, it wasn't historic.
It is unusual for both the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq composite to fall below important psychological levels on the same day -- the industrials breaking 10000 and the Nasdaq composite 2000. The round numbers don't necessarily mean much to market analysts, but to many investors they are touch points.

A wave of selling that began in Japan and Europe swept through the U.S. stock market, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 10000 for the first time since Oct. 18.
Selling shifted suddenly to blue chips, after being focused for weeks on the Nasdaq Stock Market's technology stocks. Large institutions sold some of their recent winners, including Dow industrials that have been up strongly during the past year such as Boeing, United Technologies and Philip Morris. Having fallen 4.1% on Monday, the industrials yesterday fell an additional 3.1%, or 317.34 points, to 9973.46, the index's lowest close since 9811.24 on March 14 a year ago.
With the selling frantic from the start, the Dow industrials sank more than 300 points within minutes of the opening bell. Every one of the 30 members of the Dow industrials finished the session lower, replicating their performance of Monday's Nasdaq-led market rout.
While individual investors remain remarkably calm, traders said they were starting to feel shell shocked. They dealt with a mix of rumors about troubles abroad, as well as sudden weakness in stocks they had relied on as outposts of strength.
As trading ended on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at 4 p.m. EST, packs of traders huddled around the trading posts, eager to see the price of the last sale and learn whether their orders were filled. When the bell rang, there was a sense of relief.
It was very different from the balloon-decked party atmosphere when the industrials first closed above 10000 two years ago this month. "Everybody was caught off guard by the severity of the downturn at the open," said Joseph Cangemi, a floor broker with Francis P. Maglio & Co. "When the market drops [more than] 200 points, it forces you to a different state of mind," he said; it makes you "more aggressive" and trading becomes "emotionally driven."
An added element of uncertainty, he said, was tomorrow's "triple witching day," the quarterly expiration of stock options, index options and futures contracts, which typically results in more volatile trading.
On Merrill Lynch & Co.'s New York stock-trading floor, the listed-trading chief, Edward McMahon, recalled how the market sank in late 1998 and recovered. "Do you see panic in the room?" Mr. McMahon asked, spreading his arms apart. "There's no panic."
Mr. McMahon added that investors are "starting to bottom-fish," looking for cheap stocks to buy. But, he said, these days the market is just too tough to call. "We thought we saw a capitulation on Monday," he said, "then this morning. But look what happened: It stopped." A few minutes later, the closing bell rang to half-hearted whoops and applause on his floor.
Fueling the selling were unconfirmed rumors that some Japanese banks could face a financial squeeze before their fiscal years end on March 31, and some traders said they saw signs of indiscriminate selling of big, liquid stocks such as shares of drug makers and U.S. banks. For the first time since January, the industrial average fell more heavily in percentage terms than did the Nasdaq Composite Index, which fell 2.1%, or 42.69 points, to back below 2000 at 1972.09.
Fitch, a credit-rating service, put 19 Japanese banks on its credit watch list, suggesting that the ratings on those banks are likely to be downgraded. That action helped provoke a sell-off of U.S. banks with extensive exposure to international loans. Citigroup fell 7%, while J.P. Morgan Chase fell nearly 8%. Those stocks, together with American Express, were the biggest percentage decliners among the Dow industrials.
One sign of how jittery investors became: Stock traders cited a comment from a Moody's Investors Service analyst that two Japanese banks, Daiwa and Chuo Mitsui, are troubled and close to technical insolvency, though Moody's has rated them that way for some time.
"The market is so weak now that it was like knocking over a feather," said John O'Donoghue co-head of listed trading at securities firm Credit Suisse First Boston. He said some investors were reacting to a rumor that one institution was making a forced sale of $3 billion in stock, even though various versions of the rumor put that institution in Japan, Europe or the Middle East.

All the same, traders said there was plenty of stock selling by foreign institutional investors.
"We certainly saw sell programs, there is no question about it," said Ned Collins, head of trading at the Daiwa Securities America unit of Daiwa Securities, which is different than Daiwa Bank, referring to big orders to sell several stocks at once. "There is no doubt that we had more sell programs today than we had buy programs, by a fairly large amount. It was done over the course of the day."
In fact, according to Jeff Rubin, research director at market-research firm Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn., nearly all the day's net institutional selling demand was accounted for by the nearly $1 billion in net selling that took place during the first 15 minutes of trading, presumably based largely on orders from foreign sellers. Sales continued as the session progressed, but they were balanced by requests to buy stock, Mr. Rubin said. The industrials' decline at the end of the day, 317.34 points, was slightly narrower than the decline of 325.94 that the index had registered as of 9:50 a.m. EST.
"There was just indiscriminate selling," said Matt Johnson, who supervises both Nasdaq and Big Board trading at Lehman Brothers. Big institutions were selling what they had, meaning that, at this point, nontechnology stocks actually were hit harder than technology stocks. The composite index of the Big Board fell harder than did that of the tech-dominated Nasdaq. "We got a tremendous amount of bad news today, and I would suggest that the market is reacting to more macro news than company-specific news," Mr. Johnson said.
Treasury bonds rose as nervous investors moved money out of stocks. The dollar strengthened.
Some investors were buying technology stocks as their prices fell, which helped insulate the Nasdaq composite from the heavier declines that hit the Dow industrials and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which fell 2.58%. One faint consolation for technology investors: The Nasdaq's finish of 1972.09 was above the 1923.38 close of Monday, when that index fell 6.3%. Yesterday's point drop in the Dow industrials, by contrast, was the 10th-largest in the index's history, though in percentage terms, which most investors consider the more relevant comparison, it wasn't historic.
All the same, the Nasdaq composite is down 61% from its record 5048.62 of March 10 of last year, deep in a bear market, defined as a 20% decline from a closing high. The S&P 500 also is in a bear market, down 23.6% from its high. The Dow industrials are down just 14.9% from the record set on Jan. 14, 2000.
George Cohen, president and chief investment officer at New York money-management firm Cohen Klingenstein & Marks, who dumped many of his technology stocks a year ago, said he has decided that the technology sector has been punished enough, and he has been buying.
"The recent economic news makes it look like we probably have hit the bottom," Mr. Cohen said. He is staying away from Internet companies such as Amazon.com, but has been buying such hardware makers as Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, EMC and Compaq.

"People are taking a look at what they have in their portfolio, where they still have an actual profit and selling those things, with a thought that there is value to be bought in technology land," said Mr. O'Donoghue of Credit Suisse First Boston. A smattering of technology names, such as Dell Computer, JDS Uniphase, Gateway, Tellabs, EMC and Applied Materials finished higher.
The Nasdaq composite, down 4% at its low yesterday just after trading began, managed to recoup nearly half that decline.
Not everyone, of course, is feeling optimistic about technology -- or about stocks of any sort, as demonstrated by the breadth of the session's declines. It wasn't just banks and favored blue chips that fell. Almost every sector of the market was down, including transportation companies, utilities, industrial companies, consumer-product makers, telecommunications concerns and drug companies. Those buying stocks were taking risk. Those seeking refuge weren't going to safe-seeming stocks, but to bonds, cash or even foreign stocks.
The market could have further to fall, warned William Greiner, chief investment officer at UMB Bank in Kansas City, Mo. He is advising clients to put money into European securities until the extent of the U.S. economic decline becomes clearer.
Even though many small investors are stoic and haven't been yanking their money out of mutual funds, there is enough apprehension that Motley Fool, a personal-finance Web site, said many of its visitors were turning to a discussion board labelled "Freaking Out About the Market."
It is unusual for both the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq composite to fall below important psychological levels on the same day -- the industrials breaking 10000 and the Nasdaq composite 2000. The round numbers don't necessarily mean much to market analysts, but to many investors they are touch points.
On top of everything else is triple witching, the options and futures expiration, which has been staggered to begin Thursday night and continue through Friday. The expiration can create volatility.
Since hitting a high at $16.96 trillion on March 24 of last year, the market value of U.S. stocks, measured by the Wilshire 5000 index, has fallen 27%, or $4.6 trillion. This week alone, the value of the stocks in the Wilshire has fallen 5% on paper, or about $675 billion to about $12.36 trillion. The Wilshire 5000 includes about 7,200 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company with headquarters in the U.S.
Many traders think the market is due to bounce. The question is when. "The most difficult thing for most of us right now is to try to figure out what the catalyst is going to be to possibly turn us around," said Mr. Collins of Daiwa Securities.
Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 1.93%, or 2.69 points, to 136.98.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks sank. On the Big Board, where 1.37 billion shares traded, only 766 stocks rose and 2,316 fell.
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 22/32, or $6.875 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to the price, fell to 4.843%. The 30-year bond was up 28/32 to yield 5.277%.
The dollar rose. Late in New York, it traded at 91.10 cents to the euro and 121.10 yen, from 91.48 cents and 119.74 yen.
