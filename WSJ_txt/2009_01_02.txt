Stocks rang in the new year with the biggest first-day rally since 2003.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 258.30 points, or 2.9%, to 9034.69, its first finish above 9000 since Nov. 5, the day after the presidential election.
All 30 Dow components posted gains, led by General Motors, which jumped 14% after getting its first $4 billion in loans from the government. Energy stocks rose as oil futures gained 3.9%.
It was a promising beginning after the Dow's 33.8% drop in 2008, its worst performance since 1931. Traders and analysts often look at the market's performance early in the year as a possible harbinger of things to come over the next 12 months.
But early-year performance can be an imperfect indicator. The Dow's first-day gain in 1931, up 3.2%, was its second-biggest ever, but the year ended down 52.7% -- the worst annual performance in the Dow's 113-year history.
"The problem with a lot of the old cyclical readings is that we don't know how much of the normal trading structure has been dislocated" by forced selling by hedge funds and other players desperate to raise cash in late 2008, said Roger Volz, a trader at Hampton Securities, a New York brokerage. With the economy expected to remain weak at least though the first half of the year, there could yet be more selling, perhaps weaker than last year's rush to the exits but still harmful.
The Dow finished the week up 6.1%, after four weekly losses. Friday's rally followed two days of gains at the end of 2008, for a 6.5% three-day winning streak.
Other market yardsticks also climbed on Friday, although volume was light. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 3.2% to 931.80, also its highest close since Nov. 5. It was up 6.8% for the week.
Treasury prices were under pressure as investors abandoned safe-haven instruments in favor of stock. Yields rose as prices fell, with the two-year note at 0.883%.
The price of oil reflected renewed conflict in the Middle East, as well as buying after its sharp drop in the second half of last year. Although oil futures rose nearly 23% in the week just ended, to $46.34 a barrel in New York, they are still down more than 68% from an exchange-record high last July.
