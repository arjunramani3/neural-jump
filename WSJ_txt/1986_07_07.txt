NEW YORK—Wall Street awoke from Liberty weekend with a bad hangover.
After closing at a record just last Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday posted its steepest point drop ever and the sharpest percentage decline in almost four years. At the end of the day, the industrial average was 1839.00, off 61.ST points, or 3.25%. Broader market gauges, such as Standard & Poor’s Corp.'s index of 500 stocks, were also off sharply
The sell-off was apparently prompted by worries about the U.S. economy and,

more specifically, by unexpected recommendations to sell stocks from a few of Wall Street’s most widely followed analysts. Other factors, according to traders, were yesterday’s Supreme Court ruling invalidating parts of the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing legislation (see story in column one) and stock sales related to arbitrage between stocks and stock-index futures contracts.
As usual after such a dramatic reversal, traders and analysts were asking themselves whether yesterday was only an aberration or the end of what has been a memorable party. The stock market has been on a steady roll since last September, rising more than 20% in the last six months alone.
Emergence of the Bears
The bears, whose numbers seem to have grown in the past few weeks, maintain that economic conditions have set the stock market up for a fall. They point to a growing list of government reports indicating the economy is relatively weak, suggesting that corporate profits may not grow fast enough to justify record stock prices. Many technical analysts, who try to predict market moves by looking at historical trends rather than economic factors, are also increasingly bearish.
Other investors are less worried. "The market needed a slap, and it got it,” says Joel Leff, a partner in Forstmann-Leff Associates, a New York money-management concern. While he thinks there have been excesses-most notably, an overblown new-issues market-Mr. Leff remains bullish for the long term. With inflation low, investors will accept higher stock prices in relation to company earnings, he says. Moreover, the money manager thinks a sharp drop like yesterday’s is less ominous than "weeks and weeks of Chinese water torture, where the market keeps inching down "
Much of yesterday’s selling was laid at the door of technical analysts, the so-called elves of Wall Street. In recent days, several respected technicians have warned investors of an imminent drop in stock prices. The most notable turnabout was by John Mendelson, the head market analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Mr. Mendelson. a longtime bull, issued a blanket "sell recommendation" before the market opened yesterday at 9’30 a.m. EDT. A half-hour later, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 22 points. The Sunfish Decision
Mr. Mendelson says he had been feeling increasingly uncomfortable about the market's surge this year. But it wasn’t until he was "sitting in my Sunfish sailboat” last weekend on Lake Champlain in Vermont

that he decided to tell clients to get out of the stock market. Mr. Mendelson's recommendation was based in part on some ar-cane-and controversial-technical barometers such as the "diaper” indicator, which compares the trading volume in rising issues versus declining issues. Nonetheless, the analyst has quite a following among professional money managers.
Other technical analysts who have recently turned sour on the stock market include Robert R. Prechter. publisher of the Gainesville.

The last three expressed their views in the latest issue of Barron’s magazine.
The impact of the sell recommendations by Mr. Mendelson and other technical analysts "was like the old days of Joe Granville.” says John M.

Bearish Signs: Stocks Suffer Drop Of 61.87 Points, the Sharpest Ever
ABREAST OF THE MARKET
Continued From First Page lty to move the market with his pronouncements—most notably one sell recommendation on Jan. 7,1981, that turned the market on its head. But his influence has waned in recent years.
Alfred Goldman, a stock-market strategist with A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, maintains that the sell signals from Mr. Mendelson and others merely “greased a slide” that was going to happen anyway. He and several other analysts point to, among other things, the speculation in new issues and over-the-counter stocks and the dimming economic prospects.
“Investors lost faith that there would be an economic upturn in the second half of the year,” says Abby Cohen, a portfolio strategist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. Yesterday, Goldman, Sachs & Co. lowered its overall 1986 earnings forecast more than 5% for the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. In addition, a survey of purchasing managers, released yesterday, showed increased pessimism about the economy.
In general, Wall Street's hopes of 1986 earnings growth have been fading lately. A survey of major brokerage houses by Zacks Investment Research of Chicago shows analysts forecasting average earnings growth of 12.9% this year. That's down from the 18.9% they predicted in March, and many investment professionals say further cuts are likely.
Some traders said yesterday’s decline stemmed partly from sales of stock index futures contracts as part of hedging maneuvers by money managers. Selling futures contracts protects money managers in a declining stock market since any losses on their stock holdings are made up by gains from selling the contracts. Some traders believe there could be more such selling, which could drag both the stock and futures market down in the next few days.
Most traders said selling tied to stock index futures arbitrage probably played a relatively small role in yesterday’s tumble. The director of stock index futures trading at a major New York firm said: "This was a good old-fashioned stock market correction. You can’t blame this on stock index futures arbitrage or the bond market.”
Indeed, the bond market rallied at the opening yesterday, but retreated to wind up little changed in light trading. Much of the stock market’s dramatic climb since last September was made in lock step with the bond market.
Yesterday’s decline surpassed the 45.75-point decline June 9 and was the largest percentage decline since Oct. 25, 1982,
when the industrial index fell 36.33 points, or 3.52%. The decline was broad-based, with declining stocks on the New York Stock Exchange holding a nearly 6-to-l lead over advancing issues at the closing bell. Big Board volume totaled 138.2 million shares, up from 108.3 million shares Thursday.
The broad declines in yesterday’s market showed “there are no really safe harbors,” said Ms. Cohen of Drexel Bumham.
Some of the winners of the past few weeks were among yesterday’s biggest losers—retailing, drug, food, beverage, tobacco, and rate-sensitive issues such as bank, thrift, insurance and utility stocks. Issues that are particularly sensitive to economic trends—technology and basic industry stocks, for example-also had big declines yesterday.
Among the retailing stocks, Federated Department Stores fell 3% to 83% on more than two million shares. It was the most active Big Board issue. Sears tumbled 1% to 46%, J.C. Penney fell 5% to 78%, and K mart dropped 3% to 52%. Associated Dry Goods, the subject of a takeover bid from May Department Stores, fell % to 65%. May Department Stores dropped 214 to 8114.
Newspapers stocks crashed. Gannett fell 414 to 8014, New York Times Class A dropped 114 to 77%, Washington Post Class B tumbled 7% to 175%, Times-Mirror slid 414 to 68%, Knight Ridder declined 4% to 52%, Dow Jones dropped 1% to 36%, and Tribune Co. fell 4% to 71%.
In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index fell 10.20 to 400.96 as volume expanded to 120.6 million shares from 104 million shares Thursday. The decline was the largest point drop ever in the composite index. There were 458 issues advancing and 1,883 declining.
