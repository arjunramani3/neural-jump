Buoyancy which prevailed In the stock market at the end of last week was carried over into the pre-election trading1 session and all groups of stocks shared in the upswing. Gains m the leaders ran to nearly <4 points. Bonds were iirm eany, dul turned ragged in xne arter-noon, the rail group losing some of its vitality. Among foreign bonds Canadian issues were depressed by the weakness in Canadian exchange, which, on a sharp break, was carried down to a 13*6% discount against dollars.
Wheat in Chicago spurted for a 2L-cent advance, but reacted and at the close was up a little more than 1 cent a bushel. Cotton closed off 14 to 17 points.
Wall Street had before it, over the week-end, the final prognostications of the political specialists, uniformly forecasting the election of Governor Roosevelt. Results of the German elections, recording the decline in the Hitlerite vote, also was a factor in the day’s market.
Stocks were strong from the start. Allied Chemical, Atchison and Steel common were among stocks which recorded gains of a point or more at the opening. Other pivotal issues were up fractionally. The list pushed ahead through the morning. Among the utilities Consolidated Gas, Korth American and United Corp, were strong. Union ^Pacific, Chesapeake & Ohio, New York Central and Atchison led the rails. The coppers firmed up on reports of better buying abroad, with Anaconda, Kennecott and International Nickel in demand.
regarded as a distinctly unsettling factor in the outlook. However, the obvious absence of resultant disturbance in the country allayed fears here. The election decided little, but it was interesting from two angles. Herr Hitler’s National Socialists lost ground heavily, and their representation in the new Reichstag is now put at 195 members of 575, compared with 230 of 608 members in the old Reichstag. The Communists, on the other hand,* gained 11 seats and will have 100 members in the new, against 89 in the old, Reichstag.
With no party having a majority in the Reichstag, it is not possible to form a government, so the present regime is likely to be continued, for a time at least.
Rayon Maker
Both Celanese common and preferred have given good performances marketwise recentlv, wltH the preferred reaching a new high for the year and the common within striking distance of its high. Reports are that the company has been benefited by the increasing demand from the silk trade for acetate rayon. Its plants are running at capacity.
Celanese does not give its stockholders the benefit of quarterly reports on earnings. It is in that little group of companies, with stock listed on the Stock Exchange, which still lags in this respect, so that security holders have little knowledge of what intermediate results are. In 1931 the company showed a profit, but inventory* losses were charged against a special reserve.

High and	Low Friers	
Monday, on the New York Stock Exchange, four stocks (Crown Cork <fc Seal common and preferred. Indian Refining and Owens Illinois Glass i. made new highs, and one stock (Booth Fisheries preferred) made a new low. for the year 1932.
Ovens Illinois Up
Owens Illinois Glass, among the “beer” stocks, gave another scintillating demonstration. McIntyre Porcupine, one of the gold company issues, ran up in a string from 17 to just under IS, and sold above 18.
The list sold off at the start of the final hour, declining under the influence of profittaking. In the final few minutes it firmed again and it closed on a mild rally.
The steals were Helped by the trade review’s, putting production at 21% of capacity, up about l5-%. The seasonal trend at this time of year is downward, but in 1931 a similar upswing in production took place. Rails were net adversely affected by the Atchison loadings re- , port for the week ended November 5, recording I a further decline in loadings.	•
Stocks rallied in London, but British funds I were down The Fans Bourse had a steadier tone, but the market was inactive.
Stock Loan Ratio
The ratio of borrowings by Stock Exchange members to the market value of all shares listed slid back on November 1 to 1.39Sr, off .03% from the October 1 figure. The present level compares with the low* point of 1 18% on August 1 and with 5.31 Sr on September 1. 1929.
The market value of all listed stocks on November 1 was about 53,300.000.000 less than on October 1. but loans had an even larger percentage decline. Certainly, the technical position of the market now’ is strong, from the angle of loans.
Rail Construction
Little excitement wras felt in railroad circles over the application of the St. Louis-Kansas City Short Line Co. to the Interstate Commerce Commission for authority to borrow* $35,000,000 from the Reconstruction Finance Corp, to resume construction of the projected double track line between St. Louis and Kansas City. It is hardly conceivable that the commission would act favorably on the proposal, considering the amount of railroad service now’ existing between the two points.
Among the roads with routes between Kansas City and St. Louis arc the Missouri Pacific, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas, the St. Louis, San Francisco, the Wabash and the Alton. Competition for business between the two points, always keen, has been sharpened by the increasing number of trucks.
The Reconstruction Finance Corp, already has quite an ample stake in the railroads. It could hardly lend money for new’ lines w*hich would be in direct competition with the existing service, some of w’hich has been saved from bankruptcy by the corporation’s financial aid.
With the Chartists
Chart students regarded Monday morning’s opening as significant, and offered several reasons to mack their views. Since September 8, they pointed out, the market has had a distinct down trend the top of which had been tested but not pierced on September 22, 2G, 29, and on October 4, 20 and 29. Monday morning, however, the averages broke through on the upside. The trend line, incidentally, was the top of a long tnnngle, the base of which was formed by the August 13 reaction and the October 10 low*. The approach toward the apex of this triangle was accompanied by the usual characteristics of reduced volume and a narrow trading range. A clecdided brcak-aw*ay on either the upside or the downside of the triangle, accompanied by rising volume, is interpreted by chartists as an indication of a further movement in the direction of the break-away.
Finally, Monday’s opening, the chartists pointed out, was a “gap” on the outside at almost the identical level of the “gap” on the downside October 26. As a rule, “gaps” in opposite directions at about tbe same level are construed as indicating a reversal of the intermediate trend.
One house which has kept charts on 30 pivotal stocks says that all but six have broken above the down-trend line decisively.
