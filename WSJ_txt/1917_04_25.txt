that in the future the United States Government in the I>urcha*c <»f its own supplier and acting a.* an agent for the Allied Governments would not insist on arbitrary prices but would conform to market condition--.
The idea presented to the market wa» that the Gov-c mment had -<*en the mistake of insisting on special prices for a special product. Particular reference wa& made to :hr contract entered into for copper in limited quantities at a price ba<ed on the axeruge of the last three years. It was promptly “discovered tnat if all other producers made

puces ha\c been paid on tne proportionately small aiflount which wall covet <»o\emment requirements* tne law of supply and demand ha* not in any way been obstructed.
Tiu-. program would permit the extreme development □f all enterprise. and when the profit® have been reduced to actual figures, the Goverament will be in a position to place the tax where the greatest benefit has accrued. There was no po.-itive confirmation that the Government purchasing agency had reached such a sensible conclusion, but the mere suggestion that natural economic laws might hr allowed to work without restraint on production or by avoidance of taxation on the tools of industry sent the market on an upward course. The idea was that high prices, unrestricted, whether for wheat or for cotton or for cooper, would induce production; that no objection would or could be raised to taxation on the profits of this prolusion and that incentive to increase production would in .ho long run produce bigger output with lower prices.
The first Joan to Great Britain by the United States Government has been made. The sum involved is $200,000,000. Prior to tms and since the war declaration Britain and Franco have helped themselves by hand to mouth financing through collateral loan to an extent of between 8100.000.000 and $150,000,000. Canadian refunding operations have also been stopped by this country’s entrance into the war. The $3,000,000,000 bond i-sue for Allied account makes such financing unnecessary.
making up to stockholders at the rute of 5*0, and over the dividends passed curlier in the war. could stir the market out of its lethargy.
True, United States Steel wa* quoted at the opening as high as 112a*» up 1*h; but before the close of the first ten minutes it wa« selling at 112.
Failure of the Steel report to stimulate interest, crave renewed courage to the bear element, and before the close of the first half hour it had succeeded in making a considerable impression on the prices of which ere few.
General Chemical’s Decreased
General Chemical earned S7.51$c 46.01 rr in 1915. Earnings in the lirst < rent year, however, showed n falling c sponding quarter of 1916 and were $12.80 a share, decline is attributed tn difficulties in making shipments on account of the car shortage and delays in getting supplies. In the last quarter of 1916 a stock dividend of 20 r7- was distributed.
The stock opened at 221. up 1.
Sharp Upward Reaction
reversal of sentiment took place early in the hour and with an influx of buying orders driven rapidly to cover and prices mounted
A quick second half shorts were upward steadily.
Considering
The movement seemed to be based on Washington reports, where the Interstate Commerce Commission explained its attitude m expediting the rate hearing on tlie ground of a desire to save expense to the railroads, which was taken as an augury of a forthcoming favorable decision. There appeared further to be a general desire on the part of the authorities to nourish and encourage the goose that lays the golden egg* to keep on laying, rather than to starve the animal and shut down the production.
This inference was drawn from the reports of the con«crvative manner in which the Wav- and Mean* Committee is> studying the taxation nroblcm. and w*« particularly encouraged by a report that in the future this Government will pay close to market price® for copper, both fop its own u<e and for the Allies, instead of exacting the reduction recently negotiated with the copper producers.
Gulf States St4*el’s Prospects	*
Gulf States Steel was quoted unchanged nt 127.	1916
earning* of the common and preferred stocks of Gulf States Steel were $25.7 a share. In the first quarter of the current year they increased to a $40 a share annual rate, after allowing for the usual charges and for depreciation and Federal excess profits tax.. Estimates as to earnings of steel companies after the war are a little out of order on account of the uncertain conditions especially in that trade, but $23 a share have been put forward in some quarters as this company’s profits on pre-war steel prices after all new equipment is in ami in good working order. There is a good chance that the $2,000,000 first preferred will be retired next year at 110. which would then leave all earnings for the common, as the balance of the second preferred will then be converted. Bonds outstanding $342,890.
Slight Recession*
The market during the second hour reacted slightlv from ton prices, but held *to a fairly steady course on a moderate overturn. The now buying which came in during the first hour was no: continued and the traders
