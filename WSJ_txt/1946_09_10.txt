Prices ended mostly close to the lows of the d*y. with leading stocks off 2 to more than 11 points. Volume of 3 300 000 shares was accompanied by a record number of 1.108 issues of the 1.309 listed appearing on the tape. There were 851 stocks showing declines 517 stocks made new 1946 lows.
' While some technicians were talking of an oversold market for many stocks largely * as a result of the depth and rapidity of the ■ decline, it was conceded that news would have to improve to produce any sort of rally of importance. Most traders hoped for an earl> settlement of labor troubles to bolster sentiment.

The sharp break in the market ha* brought in a certain amount of buying by investors ! on more attractive yield ba*i* for many leading securities, assuming dividends are maintained. Obviously shaiper breaks and higher yields are shown for a long hat of more speculative stocks compared with the yields earlier this year.

Pierce Fenner A Beane “After endless dis-russion of what the extra shares would do to the $9 dividend rate of Amet.car. Telephone & Telegtaph, manv financial observers felt that the debenture program pmbablv is predicated upon the continuation of the $9 dividend for ’he present al least Even though greater dividend requirements would mean a big drain on the company in a pool year, the additional facilities constructed with the new monev will increase earnings ”	• • George G Bass of
Harris. Upham & Co • “It is inevitable in our opinion that the decline in the stock market has now proceeded to a point where it will have some repercussions on the general business picture We will probably hear less about

Although financing plan* for some of the airbres have been dclaved until the market show* more power* of absorption than recrntK di*plaved. business and earnings generally appear to be coming along well North-vvest Airlines for example, reports net income of $123 000 for Julv. the first month of the new fiscal vear Northwest had tne same difficulties as many of the other earners during the early months of 1946. but now is doing better
Loads are being maintained by most big air carriers and increasing for some However a real test of earning power will not be furnished until sufficient four-engined equipment is furnished to all the carriers to drive load factors down to TO^r or less under competitive pressure Then it will be seen how much monev ran be made The new Douglas DC-6 in regular scheduled operation is unlikely this vear. however.
