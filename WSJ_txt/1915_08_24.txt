the German difficulty, and its expectations on the point seemed to rest upon fairly good foundation. President Wjlson is anxious to avert a break, if possible, and the only thing which could cause a rupture of relations would be a deliberately unfriendly attitude on Germany’s part. Germany, however, is by no means anxious to precipitate a crisis. Thi* fart was made plain in tho day’s news. Ambassador von Bernstorf requested the State Department to await the report of the commarxier of the submarine before adopting definite conclusions in regard to the sinking of the Arabic, and he also expressed the opinion that rupture of diplomatic relafons between the two countries is “absolutely impossible.” While this may have been nothing more than a matter of personal opinion, it exceedingly unlikely that the Ambassador would have /committed himself to it unless he felt assured of the wish of his government to maintain peaceful relations with the United State*. and to satisfy the reasonable demand' of this Government in regard to proper precautions to insure the safety c-f neutra’s at sea. The publication of the Ambassadors statement accelerated the upward movement, and the highest prices of the day were made at or a little before the close.
The volume of activity in United States Steel was enormous, and in every respect the stock was the lender of the advance. Tho steel issues as a group gave a vc-v good account of themselves, and the conditions in tho steel trade arc such that the stock* of steel companies would almost certainly lead an important market advance if the complications with Germany were satisfactorily disno«cd of. The exchange market was somewhat easier, but not as weak as it would probably have been had the Street believed that the flotation of a British loan in Now York
%, dropped back to about 71. and traders sold it on the
ground that it had recovered sufficiently for the present
although they were bullish on trade conditions for the Ion
pull. Republic Iron & Steel opened 7
