FEATURES OF THE MARKET.
CLOSED IRREGULAR-
movements were erratic, but tbe general list showed considerable resistance to weakness in Individual issues.
-	Sales 315*670 shares.
The market porsuel an erratic and confusing course, but its action -was more calculated to induce speculators to remain on the outside than to enter into speculative commitments. At the start the general list was steady; notwithstanding weakness in the copper stocks, produced by a severe break in the price of copper metal in the London, market. During that period the general market showed an inclination to await the possible rendering of a decision in the Minnesota rate case; but when, shortly after noon, it was rumored that the decision had already been handed down, there was a sharp up-rush of prices, representing a hurried retreat of shorts. The rise was not sustained. The court left the case undecided, and stocks sold off again. A recovery followed, and the market appeared to be gaining strength, until a break occurred in the Rock Island issues, apparently due to apprehension of the possible effect upon the Rock Island holding company of a bill favored by Governor Wilson to exclude holding companies from the state of New Jersey, from which the company obtained its charter.
There was a hardening tendency in money on account of gold exports and the renewed loss of cash by the banks to the Sub-Treasury. In the course of the day $2,000,000 was taken for Paris and engagement amounting to upwards of $1,000,000 were made for export to Argentine. The Supreme Court decided that the state railroad commission of Mississippi lacked the legal right to establish delayage or demurrage rates on interstate shipments; and this was regarded as an indication of the probable ruling in the Minnesota rate case, in which the Railroad and Warehouse Commission made orders to compel a reduction to rates, apparently usurping a function of tne Interstate Commerce Commission.
Transactions totalled 315,000 shares, and at the end declines were almost general, the losses being heaviest in the copper shares and the Rock Island issues.
A quiet opening:.
The opening was exceedingly quiet for a Monday morning. Trading was light and price changes, except in the copper stocks, were negligible. There was a disposition to await possible action by the Supreme Court on the Minnesota rate case, but the market’s tone appeared to be firm.
The demoralized break in the London copper metal market did not affect the copper stocks as much as might have been expected. Smelters started unchanged at 71% and Amalgamated Copper openea at a decline of only of which it recovered a part on ,thc next few sales. Chino and the other minor copper issues declined in relatively the same degree as Amalgamated.
The first transaction in Steel was at 62 54. a decline cf %, but the next sale was at a recovery of ’4. The + raders were bearish on Steel, but trade authorities said the industry was in sound condition.
Union Pacific started at 157%, a decline of %; while Southern Pacific was unchanged at 105. The activity in these stocks was light.
American Ice gained a fraction on Saturday’s close, on the argument that little ice was likely to be cut this v. inter, and that the American company, having artificial plants, as well as a supply carried over from last year, ■would find itself in an advantageous position.
Gold for Baris.
During the first half hour the market was very quiet without developing anv definite tendency. Trade: s seemed to be apathetic, having come to the conclusion that a new impulse v as needed to cause a movement in cither direction.
The first sale of General Electric with the 307c stock dividend deducted was at 1-44. This was an advance ot 4 points from the equivalent of 1S2 at which the stock had la«t sold. Such a big gain was not maintained, and the second sale was at 112. This, however, was a net gain of 2 points; and Westinghouse was relatively strong, selling at 75%, compared with 74 bid on Saturday.
The announcement of a further engagement of $2,000,003 gold for export to Paris, combined with the fact that the banks are again losing to the Sub-Treasury, had some effect on sentiment. Brokers argued that it has usually been unsafe to buy stock when gold wa« being exported. On the other hand imports of the metal generally cause an advance in prices.
The lecent price changes in the market have brought three of the best known 6% stock to practically the same price. Atchison. Baltimore & Ohio and Southern Pacific are now selling practically together, but Baltimore & Ohio has a dividend included in its quotation.
Decline in Gt. Nor.
Trading continued dull to the end of the first hour, and the market showed a tendency to sag as the period approached its close. Traders argued that there was an utter lack of inherent strength, and that stocks could not support their own weight.
James J. Hill contributed an article to one of the Sunday papers telling of the needs of the railroads, and how essential it is to the general business interests of the country that the transportation companies should be placed in position to obtain capital to increase their terminals and make other improvements. The Street applied Mr. Hill’s argument to his own road, and Great Northern opened off nearly a point.
Strength in American Tobacco was even more conspicuous than in American Ice, but neither stock was a good leader. Tobacco opened at 285. a gain of 4 % points, and soon sold up to 288. Expectation of an increase of the dividend was the bull factor.
Attack on Steel.
There was some increase of selling pleasure in the early part of the second hour, and prices sagged under its weight. Traders said that stock had failed to rally, that the buying power was deficient, and that a renewal of liquidation was imminent. From this it may be inferred that they had not changed their position.
United States Steel was made the center of a bear attack, ar.d the stock met with only moderate suppoi t. The argument for soiling was that the bill approved by Governor Wilson to drive the holding companies out of New Jersey would be introduced in the course of the evening, and that Mr. Wilson might accompany it ■with a special message to the legislature. It was said that he had been advised by his legal counsellors that the thing could be done, and that the measure would stand the constitutional test.
When Steel gave way a little, the pressure extended to the copper stocks, on which sentiment was particularly bearish, on account of the severe break in the London market for the metal.
The trading was narrow, a large number of the usually active issues remaining unopened up to 11:30 a. m.
Weakness in coppers.
Little was done in the second hour, but at the end of the period the market developed a declining tendency, led by the copper stocks, on which sentiment was very bearish.
A favorable decision in the Minnesota rate case has been so generally expected that traders asserted that even if the Court decided in favor of the railroad interests the decision would not cause an advance in the market.
It was argued that Governor Wilson’s bill to suppress the holding companies in New Jersey indicated the policy of the President-elect, and that when he reached the White House, Mr. Wilson would probably try to prevent holding companies from engaging in interstate commerce.
There was some demand for Southern Pacific in the loan crowd, but traders said this might result from selling of the stock by Union Pacific interests, which would not be likely to deliver their own certificates until their selling was completed.
The support rendered to Amalgamated in the first hour did not prevent selling of the stock, and when the insiders saw that, they stood aside and let the price take its course. A sharp decline resulted.
A rumor of a decision favorable to the railroad interests in.the Minnesota rate case caused a sharp up-rush of prices, bears falling over one another in their efforts to cover. As soon as it was found that the report was premature, the market reacted, but retained some part of its suddenly acquired strength, probably on account of the betrayal of timidity on the part of the shorts.
Business for London account amounted tosome 10,000 shares, practically all on the selling side. The selling was heaviest in the copper stocks*
Journal
A false start. '	'	*
It was a tibia market in the early afternoon- A Rttle buying sufficed Ao pot it up. and a* tittle sealing pot it down again. It was a professional affair* and it was ao handled that the buying and the seHing did not meet , The false start on a rumor of a decision in the Mi**-nenota rate case seemed to represent concerted action by spemlative interests, which wanted to get a lino on Tnarkrt*s technical position. The sharp np-nish indicated that there was a vulnerable abort interest, and had a decision in favor of the roads been handed down the Street might have had a lively hoar or two.
When it was definitely announced that the Supreme Court had .left the Minnesota rate case undecided, the traders turned to the decision against the Louisville & Nashville on a matter of rates, which ip itself was not important, but involved another reversal of the Commerce Court, and approval of a ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission. This was regarded as bearish, but it had little effect.	*
United States Steel sold down to 61%, or within % of the lowest of the year; and Amalgamated Copper fell to 70%, duplicating the low of last week. As there is a dividend of 1%% in the price of Amalgamated, the stock may be said to have sold under 70.
Break in. IL I.
In the late afternoon the course of prices was irreg-							
ular.	There was a little recovery, and				thvn	weakness	
broke out in new places, affecting the general						list.	The
fact that new weak		spots	are being found constantly				
tends to sustain the		confidence of the			bears	in their	
position.							
The Rock Island issues,			and particularly* the cullat-				
eral trust 4% bonds, became weak.				The	4s sold down to		
62%, compared with 64% at the				opening. The decline			
was on	the argument that the Wilson bill against holding						
companies would disrupt the Itock Island company.							but
some able constitutional lawyers say the b’H						could	not
be made retroactive.							
The Rock Island 4s are r			ecured by the old Rock Island				
stock.	and in the event that the holding				: company were		
dissolved, the bonds would probably be in a					. strong position.		
The bonds have not been issued by The holding company.							
but by	another new company		known as the Chic			ago. Rock	
Island	& Pacific Railroad, which owns the stock of						the
old railway company and is			itself	owned	by the holding		
company.							
The decline in the		Rock	Island	. issues drew		attention	
back to the matter of trust busting;				and this was		the cause	
of the	increase of pressure on Steel			and Amalgamated.			
Some support was		rendered to		the Rock Island issues			
in the last few minutes, and this had the					effect of steady-		
ing the general list. Closing			prices	were	somewhat above		
the low of the day.					*
