Many investors remain anxious about the health of China and the global economy and are on alert ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting, when the central bank could raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Regeneron rose $42.77, or 8.6%, to $542.76, and Amgen gained 7.54, or 5.1%, to 154.56. [...]the technical indicators turn from red to green, we're going to have to take a cautious approach," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird.

Stocks rallied for their biggest one-day gain in two weeks, extending a bout of volatility spurred by uncertainty about China's economy and U.S. interest rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 390.30 points, or 2.4%, to 16492.68. Tuesday's surge was the largest percentage and point gain since Aug. 26, when stocks roared back from a selloff caused by unease about slowing growth in the world's second-biggest economy and its world-wide impact.
The S&P 500 gained 48.19 points, or 2.5% to 1969.41, and the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 128.01 points, or 2.7%, to 4811.93. U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.
The rally spread to Asia early Wednesday. Japanese stocks, which fell sharply on Tuesday, led the way, with the Nikkei 225 up 5.7% near the lunch break, its biggest jump in more than four years. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 2.3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 2.7% and Australia's S&PASX 200 was up 1.7%.
Fund managers have weathered big swings in financial markets since China's surprise currency devaluation on Aug. 11 intensified worries about the country's growth prospects. Since then, U.S. investors have taken their cue from China's stock market, which in recent weeks has dictated investor sentiment.
On Tuesday, the Shanghai composite rose 2.9% after recovering from an intraday loss, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 3.3%. Both markets snapped a four-day losing streak.
"People were estimating that the market in China was going to crash," said Jeffrey Yu, head of single-stock derivatives trading at UBS. "That didn't materialize. That was a huge relief."
Tuesday's rally also stemmed, in part, from hopes that China's central bank will take more measures to stabilize the country's stock market and economy, said Piotr Matys, an emerging-markets strategist at Rabobank.
Despite Tuesday's gains, many investors and analysts are bracing for more choppy trading. Many investors remain anxious about the health of China and the global economy and are on alert ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting, when the central bank could raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Ultralow rates have helped fuel a six-year bull run in stocks that is now under threat. The Dow industrials are down 7.5% year to date, while the S&P 500 has lost 4.3%.
Last week, the U.S. jobs report failed to give investors a clear indication of whether the Fed would lift rates from near-zero levels.
"The U.S. jobs report was inconclusive. There is room for further volatility," said Darren Ruane, head of fixed income at Investec Wealth & Investment, which oversees about $43 billion.
Some sectors, including biotechnology, that had dropped sharply during last month's stock swoon rose sharply Tuesday. UBS upgraded a pair of biotech stocks: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Amgen. Regeneron rose $42.77, or 8.6%, to $542.76, and Amgen gained 7.54, or 5.1%, to 154.56.
"Until the technical indicators turn from red to green, we're going to have to take a cautious approach," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird. Still, "the economy has remained resilient and that gives us less of a chance of this correction turning into a bear market," he said.
A bear market is defined as a decline of 20% or more from a recent high.
Dow components General Electric rose 96 cents, or 4%, to 24.96, and Wal-Mart Stores added 2.49, or 4%, to 66.38.
Shares in Europe rose after data from the European Union's statistics agency showed the eurozone economy expanded more rapidly than previously estimated in the three months to June.
Eurostat also raised its estimate for growth in the first three months of the year. Last week, the European Central Bank signaled it was prepared to expand its stimulus measures to rouse the Continent's economy.
Germany's DAX index gained 1.6% and France's CAC-40 advanced 1.1%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 1.2%.
U.K. insurer Amlin soared 33% after Japan's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance agreed to buy the company for GBP 3.47 billion ($5.3 billion).

In Asia, data showed that China's exports fell 5.5% in August from a year earlier in dollar terms after a drop of 8.3% in July, according to the General Administration of Customs. While analysts said the data didn't surprise, the figures underscore how China's economic slowdown is affecting trade, particularly for countries that focus their exports on China's demand.
Japan's Nikkei had been on a rally since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in December 2012 and embarked on an aggressive stimulus program. The index was up as much as 16% year to date in June. But then Japanese stocks fell in sync with markets across the region, and the government has much less capacity to step up stimulus measures.
Late Tuesday in New York, the euro rose against the dollar to $1.1204, compared with $1.1172 late Monday. The dollar bought 119.81 yen, compared with 119.28 yen.
U.S. crude-oil prices fell 0.2% to settle at $45.94 a barrel. Brent crude gained 4% to $49.52. Gold ended nearly unchanged at $1,120.40 a troy ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.193%, from 2.128% Friday, as prices fell.
