FEATURES OF THE MARKET.
Probably tlie culmination of the liquidation ■?over th'e'pimie, the expectation of a good bank state-gjlinent^alid tlie signs that big interests were still on “j+the bull side, were the principal facts behind the ^“strength and activity iu the market. The Granger ■'stocks recorded advances of from 2 to 4 points, and ■.'.'the strength in tlie Vanderbilts was a noteworthy V-feature. Such stocks as Toledo-St. Ixiuis. Chicago
Alton issues and the minor southwestern slocks •’ .‘were in good demand. The feeling in the industrial ; jgroup was very good, and some traders-were vis-posed to consider they answered to bull intlueitces ..’even better than the railroads. Sugar. Jnterna-■ tibnal Power and the Steel stocks were leading fea ,’tures. After a period of quiescence there was quite a revival of interest in the Tractions. . Money was . easy all day. The investment demand was very fair and looked like improving.
’ There was, rather better buying of the inde-.pendent steel .companies.	,"
Rumors of a closer union between the two tobacco companies were prevalent.
We are told that Colorado Fuel has sold quite a proportion of its treasury stock.

Manhattan was firm on reports that iu spite of large expenditures for the new motive power the company ^vas doing better than ever before.
B. R. T. recoiled good support generally credited-to insiders. It was »aid that operators in touch witli Albany were particularly bullish.
The Widener -Elkins following was reported actively bullish on Tobacco stocks and some of tlie buying of Atchison was for Philadelphia also.
Traders 1 hough I the market would be strong to-day mi iliqne operations and a good bank statement. but that pioiils should be taken Monday.
No special ri-asmi inis given for the Ill-point rise in Metropolitan, 'file point was to buy tn the Street cai'ly. and was acted upon freely by traders.
, The expectation of a good bank statement and the culmination of the liquidation over the panic both encouraged better commission house business.
General Elei ttic was firm and well bought and the regular dividend was what had been expected. Insiders were bullish and churned that the report would be a veto good one.
The activity ami strength tn Linseed was due ton-ports of a new silieme tor reorganization in i-omhim:tion will-, other and stronger interests on terms very favorable to (lie present .stockholders.
The ad\am<- in People’s Gas was on a report that the company would gain by the proposed new arrangement with f’n- t'it.i of Chicago. There is unde.rstood .to be n bull pool operating in the stock.
Chicago & Alton common and preferred showed strength all day and advanced on reports of increasing business and rumors of possible dividend aeTion on the common in (he fall. The buying was good.	"
' Clover Leaf common and preferred were active —and-r’imjig on t he cxpe-iat ion of a good showing in . earnings and tin? possibility ilmt tlie road would be .absorbed by some iaiger interest. The buying was very good.	‘	‘
('oh'irado Fuel A- Iron advanced on inside purchases, based on tlie extension of the company’s bm-iiiess. Tlie rumored flotation of bonds w.is ‘ taken as a bull argument. as it was expected to be made for (his purpose.
There were two fitrnis to the Iowa Central straw. Uni- was that the property would be taken by Illinois (’ent r.-tl: the other that the old plan of abs'it ptioii by Minnetipolis SI. Louis—two shares for.one—would soon bo tarried out.
Southern I’ai.-itic was well bought, and there was very little stock on tlie market. The story of a :’>/ collateral mist bond in exchange for the minority slock was very actively circulated. Private advices on the earnings were very good.
There was some little enquiry for Hie independent.steel companies and ’I’. (’. & I. was ear-tied up on a few small purchases in a limited market . The buying in Republic Steel was bet lor. amt was taken as indicating a better labor outlook.
The rise in Atchison was credited to tlie Chicago bull pool, which pill the stock up before, ami which is still bullish. Rumors of railway deals in Atchison were cnrronl. but not credited. The intention is io have if appear that Pennsylvania is buying Ah-hison. ■
There were points to buy St. Daul on the around 1lmt a big move was coming in tlie stock, as the result of buying by Union Pacific, people. Union P:t-eilic interests said I hey were not buying SSt. Paul and had nothing,in-mind which ought to affect the price of the stock.
Missouri J‘acilic was strong witli a good many of the buying orders credited to Butler Bros, ami the Gould following. A dividend next week was rumored, and there was oven talk of some interests favoring a declaration of a lump dividend at that rate.
Tt was curious how much buying ‘‘ V;i nderlti 11 interests’’ gol credit for. The slocks in which litis support was alleged were numberless and included New York Central. Union Pacific, “Clover Lea f.” Alton ami El. Paul. The wish was possibly father to the thought.
The formalion of a bull poo] on B. R. T. with an Albany backing to it was reported, and buying of this characfer was said to be recognizable. All the tractions advanced, particularly Metropolitan: 1here were rumors of legislation of a favorable character impending.
Delaw ate At Hudson advtinced on moderate buying soniewliaI of an investment character. At present prices conservative houses were willing to iecommeml the slock on its i ield, but th<- reviled rumor of a New York Central control received no confirmation from lite trading.
The s<-ttlenient of the short aeconnt in London was proceeding with some difficulty. Apart from the scarcity of stock, lhe number of options open make tlie arrangements of accounts very intricate, and many of Hie transactions do not come under the rule of the-London Stock Exchange.
St. Paul opened very strong on reports of buying for Standard Oil interests. The bulls on the stock claimed Hint lhe purchasers were in full accord with both lhe Hill-Morgan people and Harriman interests, ami that I heir position was exceptionally strong in any impending Northwestern combinat ion.
Quite a portion of lhe strength of Erie was attributed to covering. A good many people sold Eric short on an idea that the Hill stock might be sold as a result of the Northern Pacific controversy. Anoih<-r story was that the probable-settlement of the Northern difficulty had led to further buying of Erie by Hill interests.
' ' Insiders were rattier non-committal on Amalgamated < upper. They said the first round was-, theirs, ibut nobody could tell the mil conn- of a law-•uit until the soil undid. They -thought people who had Amalgamated Copper for (investment might

The .Steel slocks were lirni and it was reported that insiders who had merely protected Their holdings-in the recent past were picking up stock and talking higher prices in view of the early dividend declaration. It was taken lor granted that the preferred would get 1}^ and rumors weie iather sanguine on the dividend prospects, of the common. •	•
Loudon traded in about 29,000 shares, mostly purchases. Arbitrages houses reported that brokers had left the curb in London and expected no lurther foreign trading for the day. The recent complication in Northern Pacific has directed the London Stock Exchange Uominilte^'s attention to the curb trading and il is thought probable Unit steps may lie taken to curtail il as transactions there de not come under Stock Exchauge rules.	■
T^e reported isettlenient between American Sugar and the Arbuckles, oil a basis of the former controlling the sugar situation and conceding con-trol'of the coffee trade, had a favorable effect and accounted for the early buying of Sugar. All the news on the trade situation was good, and the prospects of the demand for the canning industry were most favorable. Insiders discouraged talk of an advance in dividend but took a bullish tlie market position.
There was considerable inquiry for South Shore pfd. on information said from New York Central sources. A closer relation witli United States Steel was expected to give it largely increased earnings as iL runs into the Lake Superior mines. International Power ad-\anced on the report that the reeeuL buying had been for Vanderbilt interests and that President Callaway of New York Central would take over the presidency of the new locomotive company.
