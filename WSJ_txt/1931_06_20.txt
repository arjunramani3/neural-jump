An abrupt reversal developed m the trend m the stock market Saturday. Wall Street held the view that the announcement of President Hoover regarding; steps to aid world economic recover} indicated that some assistance would be given Germany and other countries. With the opening of business it was evident that a firmer tone existed. As soon as stocks started moving ahead the covering of shorts became active and urgent. As a result, sharp advances were recorded in issues like U. S. Steel. Can. and others which had been pressed by the bears earlier in the week. Other shares also were strong, including the rails, which had been meeting liquidation recently. Heavy profit taking appeared in the second hour but this had little effect. The final tone was strong
Because the market had encountered resistance at about the level where it was anticipated, the conservative interests insisted that the upward trend would continue. They were advising customers to pick up their favorites among the leaders during any set-back They still recommend the use of stops on which limits should be raised as further gains are recorded.
ProfeHsioniils Bought on Balance
Some of the professionals and floor traders who had long positions were taking profits on the rally, but the heavy short covering bv thus element was much in excess of such selling. Commission houses had a few buying orders at the start. The higher prices, however, again attracted profit-taking and leading firm's were sellers on balance.
The Brokers’ Ixxin
Deer mute
Decreases in brokers loans have been shown now for nine consecutive weeks. In this period the total has dropped X430.000.000. or 232S. from $1,849 000.000 on April 15 to SI.419.000 000. the new low rec ord just reported Even more impressive is the tact that m the last 53 weeks there have been 40 decreases, 12 increases and one week with no change The arop in this period was $2 579 000.000. or 64 5'1, or from $3,998,000 000 to the latest figure.
These figure** seem to indicate that a tremendous amount of deflation has been going on. confirming the belief in •some quarters that in the recent few weeks mam stocks may have been passing into stronger hands, while these influences are admittedly constructive, they may not be felt until other vital considerations such as the business	mre of a more cheerful
nature. -	-	•*	~
Many l)i\ idend
Meetings
Many important dividend meetings will hr held m the next week nr so nnd the Street is quiotlv waiting tn s«e what form the actions will take. If there are some unexpected developments in this connection doubtless the stock market may be affected for a. time By far the most important of these meetings will be that of Westinghouse Electric, the directors of which arc scheduled to meet on Wednesday. There has been much speculation in the financial district fm weeks regarding the action to be taken on this stock.
DiMcounting QunrtxTly Statements
Judging from various comments made m the past few days, many market obseriers arc of the opinion that the latest market recession may be the result of an early attempt to discount publication of poor earnings repot ts for the second quarter The general view j«s that many of the statements will be unsatisfactory because of the lull in business during the period In the past the market often discounted such developments when they were known far in advance Consequently, when the actual news became public the maiket acted much better than most interests anticipated. This situation may be repeated in the current instance.
May Ignore Adiene Factors
One of the conservative observers m a commission house expresses the belief that the principal characteristic of the market during the summer will be its ability to stand up undei adverse developments and to ignore news which ordinarily might have had a depressing effect He believes that the market is entering a typical accumulating stage, which necessarily will be dull. However, he avers, the ground work will be laid for an upswing starting some time during the summer and running, possibly, throughout the fall.
Sheet Steel Price
Ad^nce
Many in the financial district are inclined to minimize importance of the action of steel interests in marking up the prices for sheets. This is particularly the attitude in quarters pessimistic on the market and business. In the steel industry itself there is greater confidence regarding ability to sustain the new levels. The point is made that if tbe sheet steel quotation holds- similar action may be attempted in other branches of the industry.
Bond & Share
Deflated
In some Wall Street quarters the contention is that, among utilities. Electric Bond & Share is one of the issues which has been well deflated in past months. These interests bave been calling attention to the stock and express themselves as in favor of accumulation on a scale during any good set-back.
Driggs Increasing Production
Briggs, aided by orders for the new ’Plymouth models, has been increasing its working force and plant activities recently. Reports have it that Briggs will supply all the bodies for this new car. Predictions have been made that earnings in the current quarter will better those for the preceding three months when net equalled 2 cents a share. It is maintained that the declaration <rf the regular 37'-- cents dividend a few days ago was a reflection of the management’s confidence regarding the immediate outlook, despite prospects of a reduction in automobile production generally.
Transit Is-.iie*
Exceptions
Transit issues have been outstanding exceptions during the recent reactionary periods with Brooklyn-Manhattan the feature. Buying in this stock is based on the enhancement in price under the unification plan, and the fact that the stock, at current levels, yields better than 6' < , with the dividend secure. The company’s earnings have been satisfactory and its outlook is promising. If the unification plan is finally* adopted, holders of B -M T. still will have their equity in Brooklyn A* Querns Transit, in addition to the Board of Transit Control securities they* receive and other investments Some of the floor trader? and a few outside professional * rrr said tn have purchased this stock a** a h'	.i-ain^t
an otherwise short position.
Bohn Aluminum
Ea rning*
Bohn Aluminum &• Brass i*- one of t‘u i-.sue« mentioned frequently as being among the comparatively small number of stocks which will show increased earning'’ for the first half year over the 1930 period. Estimates stiD are that Bohn will show in the neighborhood of X2 7.5 a share for the period as compared with SI 95 a year ago I>’vidend requirement for the six months’ period is 75 rents.
I’nlvornnl Ixmf
Tobacco
Universal Leaf Tobacco common is one of the inactive stocks with a somewhat wide spread between the bid and asked prices at times. This Tact i« held responsible for’xtiscouragmg an outside interest in the stock, though conditions within the organization are decidedly favorable. With more active market sponsorship the issue could become one of the favored lower-priced tobaci os. The fiscal y*rat ends with the current month and indications aie that earnings on the common may reach n* high as $5 a share, which would compare with S3.20 in the preceding 12 months. Thus the company will hnve covered its $3 a share annual dividend needs with a very commendable margin.
