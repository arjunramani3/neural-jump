This is hardly the first time this year that the Nasdaq index has staged a startling one-day gain, and so far, none of the previous gains has lasted. Never before has a major stock index registered as many outsize one-day gains as the Nasdaq composite has put in so far this year. Yesterday's surge was the 12th time this year that the index has gained 5% or more in a single day. And every one of those gains has been followed by a slump, during which the index has given back all the day's gains and more, falling to a new low for the year.
The last month at the end of every quarter is the period when companies with problems issue warnings about coming earnings and sales shortfalls. That trend already has begun, with warnings from the likes of computer makers Apple Computer and Gateway, and chip-maker Altera. Other prominent companies seem likely to follow, and if there are many such warnings, stocks, or at least the Nasdaq technology stocks, could be headed down again.
Analysts noted that, although the broad market isn't in a bear market, the Nasdaq composite is, since a bear market most commonly is defined as a 20% fall from a high. Sudden one-day gains such as yesterday's are common occurrences in an overall down market, and they can be deceptive events. Analysts call them "bear-market rallies," or temporary bursts of euphoria that typically fade into more gloom. The Nasdaq's pattern of rallies this year, in fact, looks dismally similar to that of the Dow industrials in the 1930s, when that index put in a series of historic one-day gains, but couldn't hold on to them.

For a day at least, battered investors were singing "Happy Days Are Here Again" after Nasdaq stocks staged historic gains.
Hoping for a resolution to nagging worries about both interest rates and the U.S. presidential election, Wall Street pros and ordinary people alike plowed money into stocks and bonds.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, dominated by big technology stocks that have been pummeled this year, put in by far its strongest one-day point and percentage gains ever. The index soared 10.48%, or 274.05 points, to 2889.80. The less-volatile Dow Jones Industrial Average staged its biggest percentage gain since March, and its third-biggest point-gain ever, jumping 3.21%, or 338.62 points, to 10898.72.
"You can't discount the power of this move" by the stock market, said Jon Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "This felt very broad today. It is a very positive rally. I think this has legs to it."
The catalysts were a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- hinting that the Fed might at least consider an interest-rate cut in coming months -- and Monday afternoon's decision by a circuit-court judge in Florida, which seemed to resolve much of the electoral uncertainty by putting Gov. George Bush in the presidential driver's seat.
Underneath those pressures, investors had been holding large amounts of money out of the stock market, waiting for a sign that the market had hit bottom. Rightly or wrongly, they saw yesterday's surge as the signal that it was time to go.
"The selling was overdone and people were just looking for a catalyst," said Richard Unruh, chief investment officer for stocks at Philadelphia asset-management group Delaware Investments.
Despite yesterday's euphoric mood on Wall Street, the road back to sustained stock gains could be a rocky one.
This is hardly the first time this year that the Nasdaq index has staged a startling one-day gain, and so far, none of the previous gains has lasted. Never before has a major stock index registered as many outsize one-day gains as the Nasdaq composite has put in so far this year. Yesterday's surge was the 12th time this year that the index has gained 5% or more in a single day. And every one of those gains has been followed by a slump, during which the index has given back all the day's gains and more, falling to a new low for the year.
The possible clouds on the horizon this time: Earnings warnings that many analysts fear could be in the offing from a wide variety of companies as the fourth quarter draws near a close.
"This hopefully is the start of something good," said Larry Lawler, head of stock trading at Dreyfus. He said the Dow industrials and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which soared 3.89%, appear to be "on solid ground." But he added, "I'd like to see some follow-through and I'd like to see the economy pick up before I'm really convinced that the Nasdaq is ready to continue to move forward."
For now, the mood is upbeat, even in bond-land. The Greenspan and election news sent bonds sharply upward. The yield of the 10-year Treasury note, which falls when the note's price rises, hit 5.422% in late New York trading, the lowest level since May 1999. The dollar strengthened.
The Nasdaq composite, for its part, eclipsed its previous record one-day percentage gain of 7.94% on May 30. Trading volume by 4 p.m. EST on the Nasdaq Stock Market was the third-heaviest ever, at 2.45 billion shares. New York Stock Exchange volume was its sixth-heaviest ever.

Technology stocks led the way, with Cisco Systems up 14%, Applied Micro Circuits up 23%, Commerce One up 30% and Sycamore Networks up 29%. But gains were broad, extending to financial and brokerage-firm stocks and even economically sensitive stocks that would benefit from continued economic growth. Charles Schwab jumped 14%, Chase Manhattan rose 9% and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing advanced 11%.
On paper, investors in U.S. stocks gained a total of about $613 billion, based on the market value of the companies in the Wilshire 5000 index, which includes about 7,200 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company with headquarters in the U.S. In all, the Wilshire's market value rose 4.4% to about $14.5 trillion, although it still is down 14.7%, or about $2.5 trillion, since peaking at about $17 trillion on March 24.
Many analysts are warning investors to remain on their guard, especially because something called the "earnings confession season" is upon us.
The last month at the end of every quarter is the period when companies with problems issue warnings about coming earnings and sales shortfalls. That trend already has begun, with warnings from the likes of computer makers Apple Computer and Gateway, and chip-maker Altera. Other prominent companies seem likely to follow, and if there are many such warnings, stocks, or at least the Nasdaq technology stocks, could be headed down again.
Apple fell in after-hours trading yesterday after warning that disappointing sales could cause it to post a loss, before one-time investment gains, in the current quarter.
And the troubles could extend beyond the tech sector. Some analysts are warning that bad loans and a slower economy also could hit financial companies, retailers and a variety of other Old Economy companies as well.
Investors chose to ignore the fact that the day's news was far from conclusive. Mr. Greenspan, in his morning speech to a New York banking conference, hinted that the Fed no longer sees any need to raise interest rates, but he gave no indication about when an actual rate cut might come. And in Florida, although the circuit court rejected the Gore campaign's request for further vote counting, the Gore side said it would appeal the decision.
But with the Nasdaq in a prolonged slump that had cut 38% off its value from Sept. 1 through Monday, investors were hungering for an excuse to get back into the market. Professional investors and ordinary people alike had been holding money out of stocks, waiting for a sign that the market might be bottoming. Many felt they saw that sign yesterday, and they plowed money back into stocks.
"At the margin, what happens from here? Maybe you get a friendly Fed. Maybe you actually know who the next president is going to be," Mr. Olesky said. "And maybe if you have raised enough cash, you actually can revisit the notion of putting money back into the market. The evolving themes are adding up pretty strongly in the direction of the market going higher."
Even with the gain, the Nasdaq composite still is below the 2880 level it occupied on Nov. 27, still far from the 3415.79 at which it closed on Election Day.
On top of the Greenspan speech and the Florida court decision came more economic data suggesting that the economy is coming in for a much-desired soft landing -slower growth without a recession. Factory orders fell in October, according to the Commerce Department. But sales by service companies continued to expand, the National Association of Purchasing Management said, and the NAPM added that price increases paid by companies in that sector are easing. That was a big dose of good news -- suggesting continued growth without serious inflation.
But positive as that news seemed, there still were reasons for caution.
Analysts noted that, although the broad market isn't in a bear market, the Nasdaq composite is, since a bear market most commonly is defined as a 20% fall from a high. Sudden one-day gains such as yesterday's are common occurrences in an overall down market, and they can be deceptive events. Analysts call them "bear-market rallies," or temporary bursts of euphoria that typically fade into more gloom. The Nasdaq's pattern of rallies this year, in fact, looks dismally similar to that of the Dow industrials in the 1930s, when that index put in a series of historic one-day gains, but couldn't hold on to them.
"My guess is that we are in the late stages of this bear market in technology," said Mr. Unruh of Delaware Investments. "It's just that, I don't think it is over yet. Normally, when a group is in the midst of a bear market, the rallies are vigorous, but they don't last for a long time."That doesn't mean that these stocks can't rally for a month or two," he added, but he said that the rally could wither. "I think you have to suck more money into them before you can have the final leg down," he said."
It is certainly possible that yesterday's gain is different, and that it marks a final bottom to the Nasdaq's decline. Even after the one-day surge, the Nasdaq composite still is 45% off its March 10 record, and down 32% since the year began.
The Dow industrials are down a more moderate 8% from their Jan. 14 record, and down 6% for the year.
Some analysts warn that investors' hopes, including expectations of an interest-rate cut early next year, could be exaggerated.
"Chairman Greenspan is running a bit scared; the economy is slowing faster than he anticipated," Wells Fargo economist Sung Won Sohn told clients. He said Fed policy makers are likely to indicate at their Dec. 19 meeting that they no longer are leaning toward more rate increases.
"However," he added, "it is premature to conclude that the Federal Reserve is about to cut interest rates. Chairman Greenspan still believes that a soft landing is the most likely scenario. In addition, the inflation concerns emanating from the higher costs of labor and energy are still there." What's more, he said, "since monetary policy works with a lag, what the Federal Reserve does in the near future won't affect the economic outcome in 2001 much."
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.38 billion shares traded, 2,076 stocks advanced and 841 declined.
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 21/32, or $6.5625 for each $1,000 invested, pulling the yield down to 5.422%. The 30-year bond was up 1 4/32 to yield 5.586%.
The dollar rose. Late in New York, it traded at 87.98 cents to the euro and 111.15 yen to the dollar, from 88.90 cents and 110.95 yen.
