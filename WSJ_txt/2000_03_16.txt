Suddenly, Old Economy stocks are back in the driver's seat, gunning the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a 499.19-point gain, by far its biggest point rise ever.
Capping some of the most violent price swings the U.S. stock market has seen in years, the 30-stock industrial average completed a two-day rally of 8.35%, or 819.36 points, on record volume on the New York Stock Exchange. That kind of percentage surge, which actually is more relevant than the point gain, "is almost unheard of, except coming off the crash of 1987," said Bill Schneider, head of block trading at Warburg Dillon Read. "Things that used to take weeks to happen now happen in days."
From ordinary people sitting at home to multibillion-dollar pension funds to trigger-happy hedge funds, investors decided tech stocks had come too far and that the Old Economy stocks had gotten too cheap to ignore.
The big question is: Can this blue-chip rally last? Or is this a rerun of what happened one year ago, when beaten-down industrial stocks surged briefly, only to sag and be overtaken again by hot technology stocks?
Until yesterday, the industrial average hadn't gained more than 380.53 points in a day. Yesterday, it did so easily, and almost rose 500-plus. The 499.19-point, or 4.93%, rise brought it to 10630.60. The move was striking even considering that point moves at today's index elevations are less significant, in percentage terms, than in the past. The rally created such optimism that it pulled even battered technology stocks out of their three-day nose dive. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 134.77, or 2.94%, to 4717.39.
Trading was frenzied. New York Stock Exchange volume at 4 p.m. was a record 1.48 billion shares. Three of the top-four volume days have now occurred in the past two weeks.
Never in recent years have investors seen such sudden, day-to-day shifts in what sector of the stock market is up and down. The phrase "Internet time" has become the accepted shorthand for the ability of the stock market to telescope into a morning's trading events that once took a month to play out.
For the Dow industrials, which remain 9.3% below their January record of 11722.98, the day was an almost steady sequence of buying. Both individual investors and huge institutions decided to join the crowd and pump money into beatendown nontech stocks . For the once-robust tech stocks, meanwhile, investors' views seemed to lurch from bearishness to bullishness in the blink of an eye, when the trading session was less than two hours old.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite at that hour was sinking fast, down more than 127 points on top of the previous three days' triple-digit losses; its free fall showed little sign of ending. But when the index was down 10% from its record Friday close, amid the Dow industrials euphoria, investors perked up. Rarely has an index fallen into a correction (or 10% dive from the high) in such a short period, and at that point, deciding the stocks looked cheap, tech lovers started buying.
The Nasdaq surged so strongly, in fact, that it wound up regaining all the ground it lost in Wednesday's 124.01-point rout and is now less than 7% off last Friday's record of 5048.62. From bottom to top, its intraday gain was 262.66 points. Other indexes also soared.
"We might well have seen the low of the Nasdaq for the quarter," said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.
A variety of other forces were at work in the market, besides investors' sentiment shifts. Merrill Lynch Internet analyst Henry Blodget helped knock tech stocks down in the morning by noting that many Internet companies will disappear, and by urging investors to protect themselves by owning a variety of such stocks. As the techs fell, many hedge funds and individual investors that had used borrowed money to bet on a rise were forced to sell stock and cover positions.
On the upside, news that producer prices, aside from gasoline and tobacco, rose little in February helped reassure inflation-wary investors. So did signs that early trading based on today's "triple witching" expiration of stock options, index options and futures contracts was generally leading to buying, not selling.
"It was an incredible day," Mr. Schneider said, adding that investors seemed to be motivated mainly by a desire to get in on the action. "None of the other things hurt, but the big catalyst for the day's gains was simply the strength of the gains on Wednesday."

Dow Industrials Surge a Record 499.19 --- Average Leaps 8.35% in 2 Days; Nasdaq Revives - ProQuest
In recent weeks, investors have seen the Nasdaq composite crumble 2% one day, only to soar 3% during the next one or two sessions. That same volatile behavior now has begun showing up in the Dow industrials. Moreover, the two indexes, and the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index, have taken to moving massively in different directions on the same day. And the stocks driving the Dow industrials aren't the index's two new Nasdaq tech names, a Intel and Microsoft. The Dow industrials drivers are names such as American Express, J.P. Morgan and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing.
One reflection of the day's trend: Soaring General Electric pushed back ahead of technology darling Cisco Systems as the second-largest U.S. stock behind Microsoft in total market value, at $456 billion.
What's going on -- and how in the world is an investor supposed to react?
For long-term investors, the strong, across-the-board gains held a message of reassurance: There is no need to make a drastic shift. Even skeptical analysts who worry that stocks are overvalued were saying that the recovery of the Old Economy stocks allays fears, at least for now, that they could pull the broad market into a bear market, or a drop of 20% or more. Even with this week's chaos in tech stocks , the Nasdaq composite is up a healthy 15.9% so far this year. The Dow industrials are down 7.5% for the year so far, but are no longer looking like a sinking ship.
That perspective is needed amid the violent one- and two-day shifts in market sentiment, which can cause billions of dollars in investments to shift rapidly.
At Pittsburgh mutual-fund group Federated Investors, for example, portfolio managers were cashing out of some tech stocks and moving the money immediately to industrial stocks.
"Federated has moderately reallocated away from large-growth toward" beatendown industrial and financial stocks, said J. Thomas Madden, chief investment officer at Federated. The shift wasn't radical-about 2% of the $750 million in Federated funds that are designed to move in and out of different groups of stocks and bonds. But with many other firms and individuals making similar "asset allocation" decisions, the effect was strong.
In addition, "a lot of old-industry stocks had fallen 50% from their highs," said Mr. Schneider of Warburg Dillon Read. Procter & Gamble, one of the bluest of the blue chips, was down 54% since Jan. 11. "For many people, a 50% drop is a sign that a stock can't go down any more. This market was so oversold that it had nowhere to go but up," Mr. Schneider said.
Large pension funds, meanwhile, already are looking ahead to the end of the quarter, when they will be forced by their guidelines to rebalance their holdings to reflect maximum and minimum limits on various categories. Because tech stocks have grown so rapidly since the year began, many pension funds already have begun lightening their holdings. And some traders, aware that similar trends pushed old-industry stocks up sharply one year ago, began buying such stocks this week in anticipation, helping create the trend.
Joanne Hill, head of stock -derivatives research at Goldman Sachs, noted that the rebalancing by pension funds and other institutional investors helped to explain the brief shift into Old Economy stocks at this time last year.
On paper, investors gained a total of about $653 billion, based on the market value of the companies in the Wilshire 5000 index, which rose to about $15.62 trillion, a record. The Wilshire 5000 includes nearly every publicly traded U.S. company. None of the major indexes, with their specific weightings of different kinds of stocks was even near a record. But the overall market was.
Given that surge, small investors are left to wonder whether it is too late to get in on the trend: Can they still win by buying Old Economy stocks, or is it time to get back into tech?
Influential Goldman Sachs investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen sent clients a report indicating that her favorite area at the moment is financial stocks, and that she also likes energy stocks, some basic materials, drug stocks, some real-estate investment trusts, small and midsize stocks, corporate bonds and some foreign stocks .
She reminded clients that she now advises a holding of tech and communications stocks slightly below their 40% weight in the S&P 500. And she warned that the S&P 500 may not gain much more than about 4.6% from yesterday's close of 1458.47, which would mean it is in for a dreary year; the index, even with yesterday's 4.8% surge, stands below its year-end 1999 close of 1469.25, which is also the index's high-water mark.
Other analysts warned that, with the Federal Reserve still expected to raise interest rates at its policy meeting on Tuesday and again in May, it could be risky to bet too much on "cyclical" Old Economy stocks , mainly industrial and banking stocks that rise and fall with the economy.
"The cyclicals have not yet produced the degree of rebound in their stock prices that we saw last April," Salomon Smith Barney stock strategist Marshall Acuff told clients in a report this week. "In the face of further interest-rate increases by the Fed, we question how much upside followthrough will occur in cyclical sensitive issues."
Ciaran O'Kelly, co-head of listed-stock trading at Salomon Smith Barney, said the strength of Old Economy stocks isn't a two-day flash. "There's enough liquidity out there and enough funds flowing that technology can maintain an uptrend while other groups that have been out of the limelight can jump back in and push the larger market higher," he said.
The average share of stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange rose $1.95, or 4.86%, to $42.08.
Outside the U.S., stocks also soared in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 3.28 points to 187.16.
In major market action:
Stocks skyrocketed. On the Big Board, where 1.48 billion shares traded, 2,392 stocks advanced and only 676 declined.
Bonds gained. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32 or $4.0625 for a $1,000 bond, pulling the yield down to 6.041%.
The dollar fell. Late in New York, it traded at 97.15 cents to the euro and 105.53 yen to the dollar, from 96.83 cents and 105.61 yen.
