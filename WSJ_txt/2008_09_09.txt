A day after the government bailout of mortgage investors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sent stocks soaring, those gains were reversed as worries about the health of the financial sector and the global economy returned.
Financial stocks led the declines when failed negotiations between Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers Holdings and Korean investors underscored the risks that remain for firms looking for capital to shore up their balance sheets.
Lehman shares plunged roughly 45% to $7.79, their biggest percentage decline ever and the lowest closing price in nearly 10 years, on a split-adjusted basis.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up nearly 290 points on Monday, slid 280.01 points, or 2.4%, to 11230.73. All its financial components declined, with American International Group falling more than 19%. The Dow is now just 2.4% above its bear-market low on July 15, and 21% below its record close last Oct. 9.
The broader market fell even more than the blue chips. Stocks that declined outnumbered those that rose by a ratio of more than 7-to-1 in heavy trading volume.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.4%, or 43.28 points, to 1224.51, its biggest percentage drop since February 2007 and more than erasing its 2.1% gain on Monday. All its sectors tumbled, led by energy stocks, off 6.9% amid a big drop in oil prices, and financials, off 6.4%.
Crude-oil futures fell $3.08 a barrel or 2.9% in New York to $103.26 a barrel, the lowest price since April 1, as speculators continued to unwind bets on oil and other commodities amid a slowing global economy that is reducing demand.
Investors also grew increasingly certain that Hurricane Ike will miss major offshore-drilling facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.
Among signs that jitters about stocks have returned, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index jumped nearly 13%. Small stocks fell more than large-cap names, with the Russell 2000 index down 3.5%, its biggest drop since last November.
Investors packed into Treasurys, especially longer-dated maturities. As prices rose, the yield on the 10-year note slid to 3.596% and the 30-year to 4.193%. Mortgage bonds, meanwhile, saw the impact of the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dwindle as risk premiums to Treasurys widened again.
In the options market, the implied volatility of financial names exploded. The implied volatility in Lehman options set a new record, according to Interactive Brokers. Implied volatility in Washington Mutual also jumped, suggesting investors expect to see wild swings in the thrift's shares, which fell nearly 20% Tuesday.
Fannie shares, which plummeted Monday amid concerns that the bailout would wipe out their value, were among the few gainers Tuesday and Freddie was unchanged. Both still closed below $1 a share.
