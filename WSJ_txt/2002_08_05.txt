"[Alan Greenspan]'s testimony was pretty bullish. It is very unusual for Greenspan to be caught off base like that," said Alfred Kugel, senior investment strategist at Chicago money-management firm Stein Roe Investment Counsel. "You feel like asking, did anyone know about this or did they just forget to tell him?"
They learned that AOL Time Warner, with its accounting already under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, was alleged in a lawsuit by the California State Teachers' Retirement System, the nation's third-largest public pension fund, to have been involved in complex transactions that helped an Internet company called Homestore.com boost revenue. AOL wasn't named as a defendant and said its auditors had approved the accounting. AOL shares, already under pressure, fell an additional 2.9%.
Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 2.71%, or 2.94 points, to 105.52.

THE STOCK MARKET'S latest obsession -- the risk of a double-dip recession -- pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 3%, its second-sharpest percentage decline of the year, and sent the Nasdaq Composite Index to its lowest close in more than five years.
It was the third consecutive session of heavy losses, which now have taken away most of the 13% rally the industrial average enjoyed at the end of July, and have erased all of the 10% rebound in the Nasdaq.
When the buyers were in charge, late in July, hopes spread that the worst of the bear market was over. That optimism was shattered by news last week that the government had overstated the economy's strength and was revising its numbers. Then manufacturing activity came in weaker than expected and so did employment. Yesterday came another jolt: Last month's activity in the service economy, representing more than half of all economic activity, was weaker than expected.
In July, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan reassured Congress that the economy was stronger than the doubters feared. Now, fears are spreading that a second dip into recession, which seemed an outside risk just two weeks ago, might not be so unlikely.
"Greenspan's testimony was pretty bullish. It is very unusual for Greenspan to be caught off base like that," said Alfred Kugel, senior investment strategist at Chicago money-management firm Stein Roe Investment Counsel. "You feel like asking, did anyone know about this or did they just forget to tell him?"
For the day, the Dow industrials fell 3.24%, or 269.50 points, to 8043.63. Of the 1,034 points that the industrial average rose from July 23 through July 31, only 341 points remain. The industrial average is down 20% since the year began and is 32% off its record close, hit in January 2000.
With technology stocks again hammered, the Nasdaq composite was down 3.36%, or 41.91 points, at 1206.01, its lowest close since the spring of 1997, more than five years ago. It is down 38% this year, 76% off its record.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.43%, or 29.64 points, to 834.60. Like the industrial average, it has lost most, but not all, of its recent gains. It is down 27% this year and is 45% off its record.
Bonds again surged as money moved away from stocks. The dollar, which has been stabilizing after its recent slide, also managed to put in a gain.
The fragile confidence that seemed to be building in July now is crumbling. And on top of the economic worries, investors got a fresh batch of news yesterday about corporate troubles.
They learned that AOL Time Warner, with its accounting already under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, was alleged in a lawsuit by the California State Teachers' Retirement System, the nation's third-largest public pension fund, to have been involved in complex transactions that helped an Internet company called Homestore.com boost revenue. AOL wasn't named as a defendant and said its auditors had approved the accounting. AOL shares, already under pressure, fell an additional 2.9%.
And Interpublic Group, the world's second-largest advertising and marketing firm, said it was putting off announcing second-quarter earnings to give its audit committee more time to review them. Interpublic shares fell nearly 24%.
"Those are signs that there is still a fair amount of danger" before many of the nation's largest companies reach the Aug. 14 deadline set by the SEC for their chief executives to personally certify their accounts, said stock trader Rob Cohen at New York brokerage firm Credit Suisse First Boston.
Some investors are stepping back from the market until they see how many corporate disclosures the deadline provokes. That has helped create what Mr. Cohen and other traders call a "buyers' strike," in which would-be buyers are too nervous to commit to stocks, leaving sellers free to drive stocks down.
"It is hard to sit here and pound the table and say you've got to go in there and buy," said Mr. Kugel of Stein Roe.

After far exceeding two billion shares on six trading days in July, trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange fell back to just 1.4 billion shares yesterday.
Some investors, added Mr. Cohen, are shifting money to alternative investments, such as real estate. Today, he said, investors will be watching closely for the earnings announcement and commentary of networking company Cisco Systems. Those are due after the close of regular trading hours, and could have an impact on trading for the rest of the week.
Investors ignored news that Procter & Gamble, a high-profile component of the Dow industrials, turned in better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Even P&G shares declined.
Overall, the market value of U.S. stocks fell $320 billion yesterday and is down $800 billion in just three sessions, based on the stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index. The market's overall value has fallen back to about $9.5 trillion on that basis.
Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 2.71%, or 2.94 points, to 105.52.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks retreated. On the Big Board, where 1.4 billion shares traded, 792 stocks rose and 2,476 fell.
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 19/32, or $5.9375 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.286%. The 30-year bond rose 20/32 to yield 5.171%.
The dollar strengthened. It traded at 119.61 yen, up from 118.92, while the euro fell against the dollar to 98.19 cents from 98.76.
