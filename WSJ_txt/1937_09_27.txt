After opening firmer, the market a selling drive that started late in the morning and recovered to stage its most notable rally in several weeks. Leading issues were three to five points higher at the finish, or four to six points abov the lows for the day. NIoreover, the market closed at about its best levels, which was something of an achievement.
Another move by the Federal Reserve Board to assist trade expansion may have had some psychological effect. In any event, the market after its extensive losses and recent forced liquidation, appeared in a position to stage something of a technical recovery and with the news furnishing an excuse, prices proved well able to capitalize favorable factors.
Starting the second hour the market appeared to be in trouble again and further margin calling was in evidence. Steel common broke to 77 but stiffened suddenly and held above that point. This particular selling movement did not appear as comprehensive as some of the other of recent weeks for many issues held well and the weakness seemed confined to
certain pivotal Issues, witb Steel common particularly heavy. Soon Steel was meeting with fairly urgent demand and it led a brisk movement on the upside, with rails and utilities trailing along.
Bonds were firmer and commodities were steady.
HEAVY INDUSTRIES—
Appearance of unfavorable news affecting the heavy goods industries found the stock market -sufficiently strong to accept It, the drastic shrinkage in market values having paved the way for such developments. Included in the da's budget of news were a reduction of a cent a pound in domestic copper to 13 cents, another decline In estimated steel production to 74.4%. a drop of 1.7 points for the week, and reports September building figures are showing a continuation of the slower pace that has been notable in recent months. The slower tendency In building is attributed in large measure to a substantial falling off in publicly financed work. _ Copper stocks made no response whatever to the reduction in price of the metal, steels after their morning flurry on the downside encountered better support and the building shares made infrequent appearances on the tape and showed little change from last week's quotations.
sales or general business. In fact, finance companies lately have been moving in the opposite direction, voluntarily restricting certain types of loans. In a period of tight money, however, finance companies could be expected to avail themselves of the rediscounting privilege. H.. L. Wynegar, president of Commercial Credit Co., approves the plan and believes it should work in the direction of conservatism for banks will demand certain standards of their Hnttnce customers. Thus, competitive conditions and practices should be improved.
There is bound to be prejudice in some quarters against rediscounting Instalment paper. It will be said, for Instance, that the growth ot instalment selling and financing in itself has unfavorable implications,—but to use that debt as a basis for more debt is dangerous. <Such a complaint, however, might well be leveled against the entire banking system and everything that has been done since the Federal Reserve System was born. From a strictly banking standpoint, the test of good collateral is how well does it stand up in a depression and instalment paper stood up better than much other collateral. This does not dispose ot the Question of whether it is good policy to pile debt upon debt, for by following this practice the credit managers are getting further and further away from their objective ot smoothing out the peaks and valleys of the business cycle. But so long as it is the custom, tbe holders of good instalment paper have the right to ask and obtain the same rediscounting privileges as others are getting.
pump pfiming Is needed. If those facts are not sufficient to show the way the wind is blowing, there are the three rapid-fire moves of the Federal Reserve authorities recently, all designed to liberalize credit accommodations. The inflationary road may be thorny and it may be difficult to sell that viewpoint to someone who has just seen some of his stocks drop 30 to 40 points, but no one should have expected inflation to be a bed of roses. The unfortunate side of it is that it Is difficult to encourage private capital under present circumstances, but the problem has been thrown back into the lap of the Government and ther latter is '	'	*
to do something about it.

BROWN ON BUSINESS —
The comments of Lewis H. Brown, president of Johns Manville Corp , on the business situation command respect. They coincide in some respect with views of leaders in the automobile industry.
After analyzing the causes for the decline in the stock market and business, Mr. Brown in a copyright article by United Press concludes that •‘this has been an artificially induced business recession and that all of the underlying fundamentals call for further recovery movement that should last for two or three years.”

INFLATION—
For some peculiar reason. Wall Street has not been disposed to discuss the possibilities ot inflation recently. Possibly this is due to the fact that Inflation is popularly linked with rising stock prices and after the drastic setback in the market recently it seems like a poor time to consider such a possibility. True enough, there has been little in the action ot commodity markets and in stock markets to suggest inflation lately and it is also true that the Administration touched oft a deflationary movement when It started tightening reserve requirements, initiating a deflationary trend in bank credit that has persisted up to the present time.
But basically the budget is still unbalanced and shows no promise ot equilibrium The President on his special trip through the Northwest is reported to be meeting with much local pressure for more generous relief outlays while back In Washington are a group of New Deal--ers who are prepared to tell him on his return that "economy" has been overdone and more
