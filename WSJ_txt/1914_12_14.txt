STRONG AND ACTIVE
anything would* come of the proposal favored by Mr. Burleson.
Trading opportunities
A further advance was scored in the second hour under the leadership of Beading and the coppers, and at noon the market was strong with a very considerable measure of activity. Some of the customers of commission houses seemed to be chafing at the restraint put upon them by their brokers who advised against purchases, except on reactions.
The rise in the coppers was said to be based on the probability that production, now on a 5n% basis, could be -kept down to that level until the trade improved in a very substantial degree. Only under the most adverse conditions could a reduction be brought about; but now that it is established, it is contended that the producers will not break away from it until prices rise considerably. The fact that stocks are now selling well above the official minimum affords a good opportunity for trading, and it is considered probable that normal conditions in that respect will soon prevail.
While Brie common was one of the strongest features, selling up to 24 compared with 22% at the close on Saturday and 20% at that day’s opening, the first preferred did not respond to its advance. The latter showed a gain of only a small fraction on Saturday’s close, and there seemed to be liquidation in it.	’
Advance in New l-Iaven
In the early afternoon the strength in a number of stdcks dealt in through the clearing house surpassed that shown by those in the open dealings. United States Steel, on which it was thought necessary to reduce the minimum to 48, was -55 bid at 1:30 p. m., and Union Pacific was 123 bid at the same time. Southern Pacific sold at 86%, compared with 84% at the close on July 30.
On a few transactions, New Haven advanced to 57, where it showed a gain of 3% points. The rise was helped by the announcement that the New Hampshire delegates to the New England railroad conference favored a restoration of the conditions which prevailed prior to tlie inauguration of the dissolution suit by the Federal Government. ______________________________ _______ •	American Cotton O:! was a notably strong specialty, and were supplemented by a very considerable volume of advancing to 39%, compared with 36 at Saturday’s close, business through the clearing house. At the end, advances A large amount of the company’s product is being shipped were •’■eneral, except in issues like Alaska Gold, Beet Sugar to the warring nations of Europe; and on account of the and Bethlehem Steel, which had scored large gains prior enormous cotton crop, and the plan to restrict acreage to the resumption of active trading.__next year, seed for crushing purposes is obtainable at

In the late afternoon the market quieted down and there seemed to be a disposition to await the outcome of the plan announced to admit all stocks now dealt in through the Clearing House to the open dealings on the floor of the Exchange. This will add Steel, Union Pacific and a number of other important issues to the active list, and there is some question as to whether the demand will be sufficient for a continuance of an advancing movement in an increased number of stocks.
Of the less active issues. Westinghouse gave a good account of itself, with a gam of I points when it sold up to 70. In about the same class, Car & Foundry was another noteworthy issue, advancing on 2% points 4G on light transactions.
Northern Pacific was one of the strongest features the railroad list, making a gain of 3% oy selling up 104%. It had Leen a particularly weax feature prior the close at the end of July, when it was sold short on the idea tnat u •large*sxmou»*t of :t was held abroad. That supposition is now shown to have been incorrect and the short interest remains.
. A- spirited rise occurred under the lead of the coppers and the eastern railroad stocks. .
Sales, 231,111 shares
The maricet on the first full day bore out the cneoorag-iwg indications afforded by Saturday*a half session, and there was a substantial volume of activity, with an upward tendency in the general list, the advances in many cases running to three or four points, and even more. The copper issues, and particularly Amalgamated, were very strong, on favorable’ trade reports, some of the producers befog said to he holding cut for 13% cents a pound, while sales were actually made on a basis better than 13 U cents. The eastern railroads were helped in large degree by reiterated reports to the effect that the Interstate Commerce Commission would rexjder a favorable decision in the freight rate case at an early date, a factor which, of course, produced an influence on the whole market. Northern Pacific advanced sharply on a moderate volume of business, and large gains were recorded in stocks like United States Steel and Union Pacific, ‘	’
the transactions were still handled through the house.
On account of the almost complete absence

This i-^hTnent of practically normal conditions is a remarkable achievement, seven hours of business having been sufficient to dispel the fears that had long existed of a he-a^-y volume of foreign liquidation. The market for bonds was stimulated by the rise in stocks, there being greater activity in the bond department than on any otner day since business was resumed. The dealings in bonds amounted to $2,531,060, compared with a previous average of less than $1,500,000.
Open transactions in stocks totaled 231,111 shares.
The opening was strong and active, so much so that some of the houses said the market was going too fast, and was more likely to scare away than to attract public interest. There seemed to be a scarcity of stocks, however, and the factor of a possible increase of rate* had not lost its potency on the bull side.
The stocks of tho eastern roads vveie notably strong. Uehigh Valley opened a point up at 133 and Reading also gained a point by opening on 1,000 shares at 149. The first sale of Erie was at 23%, a gain of %.
The remarkable strength displayed by St. Paul on Saturday was sustained at the opening, the first transection being 1% points up at 92%. There seemed to be a good sized short interest in St. Paul, with little of the stock offering.
Amalgamated Copper gained % on the first sale, by epening at 52%; and its strength, combined with ths -	-	•	•	•	? ig movement in

Hhe in Anialframsitcil
Shortly after the opening;	,
the market was overshadowed by the strength and activity in the copper group, in which there seemed to be a large short interest, while the more favorable news regarding trade conditions helped to increase the difficulty of obtaining a supply of those stocks. At the end of the first half hour the general list was strong.
Amalgamated Copper advanced to 54%. where it showed a gain of 2'4 points on Saturday's close, and Utah at the same time rose to 51 compared with -IS’v at the close on Satui day. Inspiration gained 1 points by selling at 17Ts.
Consolidated Gas convertible 6s “when issued showed rn improving tendency ami sold around 110 compared with 109-1. on Satu-day.
Conservatism of brokers
At the end of the first lioui the market was comparatively quiet, but the list showed piactically no diminution of its strength, notwithstanding that many of the commission houses advised customers not to buy on the I ulge. and to realize profits if they had any in sight. The enlv issues which showed hesitation were those like Bethlehem Steel and Central Leather in which there had been l*ig ads ances prior to the resumption of open trading.
