Stocks surged forward in a broAd market yesterday, the uprush In the final hour carrying the Dow-Jones average of 30 industrial stocks into new high ground for the current recovery. The industrials, in bettering thn obvious high of August 16, followed the leadership of the rail average, which broke above the previous high on August 18, and closed last night almost 3 points above the August 16 level. Bonds continued to forge ahead sensationally, the Bow-Jones average reaching a new top on the upswing and the best level of the year.
Commodity markets were firmer. Wheat closed up about half a cent a bushel and cotton up from 14 to 20 points, new highs on the move.
Stocks opened firm and active. Through the morning, secondary issues forged ahead, while the pivotal stocks swung in a narrow range, near the day’s best levels. In the final hour, however, the leaders like American Tele-pone, Union Pacific. Allied Chemical, du Pont. United States Steel and Atchison fairly shot ahead. Union Pacific closed up almost 10 points on the day. Atchison up 6, Telephone 6. and American Tobacco B	Steel ran up close
to 4 points and Consolidated Gas advanced 3. Volume for the day reached 3.200,000 shares, against 2,200.000 shares on Friday. In the final 50 minutes, when demand for stocks was most urgent, transactions totaled 1,100.000 shares, compared with 500,000 shares in the similar period Friday. The close was at about the best levels of the day.
The week-end news furnished little background for the sharp upswing. Commodity prices for the most recent week, according to two indices, were slightly lower. The news from Ottowa in regard to the agreement on Empire trade, while uncertain from the longterm standpoint, could hardly be interpreted as bullish in its immediate effect. Governor Roosevelt's speech contained a number of passages which might have been unsettling.
The report of the Reconstruction Finance Corp , for the period from July 21 to July 31, was less gloomy than many had forecast. The report showed that no New York City banking institutions were included among the borrowers, and only five insurance companies—none of them in New York. With only a few exceptions, the loans made to banks dunng the period were to relatively small institutions. However, the amount of the corporation’s funds required during the 11-day period was striking.
Both the industrial and rail averages yesterday for the first time attained a 60S© recovery of the ground lost between the spring highs and the lows of July 8. The 60% point on the rails was 30.07 and allowing for the one point of full confirmation, at 33.20 they were emphatically past 31.07. Sixty per cent for the industrials was 69.76. and again allowing a full point margin, at 70.87 they were decidedly through that mark. A typical recovery following a panic decline in a bear market has in the past run from approximately 40% to 60% of the ground lost on the previous decline. This is the first time since the market broke in September of 1929 that both averages have achieved such a recovery.
overboard. With forced liquidation out of the way as a major factor in the bond market, prices have moved up 'steadily. 'The'big gains in low-priced bonds, any number of which have doubled in value, have attracted a speculative following,-> but so far intermittent waves of profit-taking from this element have been absorbed quite easily. '
National Power Keeps -	,
In Strong Position
National Power & Light has been one of the few utility holding companies which have been able to maintain, through the period of business depression, an extremely strong cash position. Current assets of the company, as of June 30. were 519,672.973,* against chrrent, liabilities of $812,313. Cash and marketable securities alone totaled $15,183,803. Curernt position of the company, as of June 30, last, was slightly improved over that of a year previous, despite a falling off In earnings.	'
Net income for the 12 months ended June 30 was equal to $1.56 a share on the common, against $1.72 a share for the preceding 12 months. Both the common and preferred stocks of the company have moved up sharply in the recent rise of the utility shares. National common currently Is selling around 17, or more than double the year’s low of 6*m, while the preferred has advanced to around 66 from the low of 35. Net inocme for the 12 months ended .Tim?, incidentally, was about six times preferred dividend requirements for the period.
Atchison Loadings Drop Wider on Percentage Basis
The Atchison loadings report, for the week ended August 20, put something of a damper on the more optimistic feeling In regard to the railroads. The report, the first to appear from any carrier for the most recent week, revealed a drop fom the previous week of almost 2,000 cars, and a greater decline from the like 1931 week, on a percentage basis, than for the week ended* August 13 as compared with the similar week of 1931. Some pickup had been looked for.
Atchison loadings, recently, have not afforded an accurate gauge of what loadings for the week, for the country as a whole, will show. They do reflect traffic movement through the West and the Southwest. Loadings for the country as a whole for the week ended August 20 in the past four years have shown a seasonal uptrend. Last year, the gain in the August 20 week, over the preceding week, was slight, but in the three previous years. It was sharp. New York Central and Pennsylvania loadings recently have given fairly accurate indication of trend for the country as-a whole.

Pace of Bond Market Advance Increases
The pace of the advance in the bond market has been accelerating recently, the upswing in th Dow-Junes average of 40 corporation issues in the past week of trading having been wider than in the three previous weeks. The bond market has pickd up momentum at the higher levels, rather than tapering off. There have been periods when the market, for a brief time, took on a ragged appearance, but these have been short-lived, and bonds have pushed forward again at a slightly more rapid rate.	•
The Dow-Jones average of 40 corporation Issues closed on August 13 at 78.70. Last Saturday, the average stood at 81.85, a gain in the week of 3.05 points, or around 3.8' i. In the period between August 6 and August 13, the average- moved up from 76.30 to 78.80, a gain of 2.50 points, and only up 3.2%. In the period between July 30 and August 6. the average moved up to 76.30 from 74.97, an advance of 1.33 points, or less than 2%.
The widespread demand for bonds has reflected some return of investor confidence. During the drab days of the spring, bond prices were breaking sharply under forced liquidation. No regard was paid to values, and intrinsically sound railroad issues were thrown
