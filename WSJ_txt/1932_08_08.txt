“Replacement” Demand Holds Up Stock Prices	.
One of the interesting aspects of the market is that replacement demand for stocks has been one of the sustaining factors. Many individuals, who were bullish at the bottom of the market and bought stocks, sold out when they had what they considered a fair profit. For Instance, in Sears-Roebuck, some of the people who bought the stock at around its low, sold their stock out between 15 and 16, where they had a profit of around 50% on their investment. The same is true in Union Pacific,’where buyers of the stock around 35 became sellers at around 55, only to see the stock surge ahead.
A number of individuals, who remained bullish on the outlook but were skeptical of a continuation of the rise, have turned about and replaced their long holdings at higher prices. Demand from this source has been a stabilizing factor In the market.
Stocks churned about violently at the ing of the new week on the New York Exchange yesterday, soaring during the middle of the day, and then slipping off in the late trading for an irregularly higher close. Bonds, on the other hand, continued their steady upward movement, holding their gains better than many stocks The commodities markets ueic strong, with wheat finishing at the top. and cotton closing with a gain of around $4 a bale. The wide upsurge in cotton was due to the surprisingly low government crop forecast, as well as to the rumors that the weight of the Farm Board’s selling might be lifted from the market by purchase of its holdings by a syndicate.
Strength in tbe commodities markets was an important factor in the further gains in stock prices. The action of the marke' early decline, was another big factor in attracting new buying Volume receded as stocks slid off after a strong opening -------- '----....	__ __	_	_ ______

Higher Price for C. A O. Benefits Chesapeake Corp.
Chesapeake Corp, common is a good example of a holding company stock which moves swiftly t in reflection of higher prices for th© issue In
•	which the bulk of the holding company’s funds

4,060,509 shares of Chesapeake & Ohio mon In addition, the corporation also small blocks of Eric and Perc Marquette
mon Based on the current market price of around 19 for Chesapeake & Ohio, the x’alue of . Chesapeake Corp.’s holdings ot the stock are
•	in the neighborhood of $77,235,000, compared with only $39,632,750 at the low price ot 9% for C <fc O. common.
The appreciation has brought the x*alue of the company’s holdings of Chesapeake «fc Ohio itself, on the ] common alone to more than the principal ! amount of Chesapeake Corp, bonds and un-1 funded debt outstanding. Currently, the Chesa-They forged ahead ; peake Corp has outstanding roughly $32,050,-
secured accounts payable, and roundly $43.900,000 principal amount of convertible, collateral tiu«t 5'. bonds, a total of around $73.-SOfi.OOH
. Techn.caJly speaking, every point upward in Chesapeake A: Ohio common should mean an advance of roughly 2 26 points in Chesapeake , Corp, common.

.	was 4",., and it ha^ rebounded to the
i current price of around 11
One of the most striking; things about the , Hi rec tors of both Chesapeake & Ohio and current advance is that a number of the large : Chesapeake Corp meet for dividend action next houses continue to be seller*? on balance One important wire house, in Friday’s and Saturday 8 trading, was a seller on ba lam.” to tne extent nf >l:ghtlx more than $300 000 In some quarters it is pointed out that mo«t nf the bux • ing ha? been nutright and that debit accounts m brokerage houses remain at-extremely low levels From all reports, the short interest ir. the maikct rema*n« large
