MARKET DIARY
A ti Appraisal—
By Victor j Hillery
The oppressive gloom that has overhung the stock market in recent weeks was relieved a bit by Friday’s explosive rally, and some money managers think they see glimmerings of a few hopeful signs
The market has been "severely oversold” and the weakness earlier last week in the "top tier.” a premier group of stocks popular with institutions in recent years, "could signal a final correction phase," says Kenneth S. Rolland: he is sc mor vice president of Chemical Bank, which shepherds about $7 billion in trust funds.
But although the bank believes the market offers “tremendous values." it has “stayed cautious and is maintaining significant reserves,” he says. “In a typical balanced account we have 60% in stocks and 40% in money-market instruments and fixed-income securities,” he asserts. “But we haven't been increasing reserves recently.”
The reason for this stance, he says, is a belief that a reversal of the market’s current major trend will require “solid evidence m three areas in order to restore confidence.” What’s needed, he contends, are “more responsible fiscal policies” by the U.S. and other governments, an easing of the liquidity squeeze in the banking system and a more permanent arrangement for the recycling of the money flowing to oil producers. But he also cautions that too rapid a move toward deflation could weaken the economy much more than has been expected.
Mr. Rolland sees sluggish business continuing “well into 1975," with dampened final demand for goods and greater availability of raw materials. This will foster, he suggests, a move to reduce inventories and, in turn, a moderating of loan demand. He thinks loan demand is already cresting. In the week ended last Wednesday business loan demand at 12 leading New York banks rose only $92 million, compared with a $1.1 billion gain the pnor week. It was this news late Thursday that triggered Friday's rally.
Lower Short-Term Rates
An easing in loan demand, he says, will bring lower short-term interest rates, which he foresees retreating to the 9%-to-10% level. He expects the consumer price index to hold at 10% or above the rest of 1974 because the rapid rise in wholesale prices hasn't entirely "worked its way through the system.” But he’s encouraged by a drop in commodity prices and sees this reaching consumers in 1975.
In its stock investments, he says, tlie bank likes companies whose products are used to cut costs and improve productivity. It also favors “defensive” stocks, such as food, beverage, tobacco and general merchandise retail issues, and specialty growth companies that "have had severe price corrections but with their basic earning power and strength still intact.”
Stock prices have become so cheap, he contends, that it’s difficult to see how values can be expected to fall much further “without being pessimistic about the future of free enterprise.”
While further international monetary weakness could send the stock market still lower, “it is already oversold and could easily launch a good summer rally in the near future,” suggests John H. Durham, investment vice president of Delaware Management Co., which runs four funds with assets of $600 million. And Delaware Management has been using the period of market weakness to become fully invested.
Among the more positive factors he cites is that oil inventories are at record levels, which could lead to lower oil prices. And he thinks Treasury Secretary William Simon’s meeting with the Saudis could result in some resolution of the problem of recycling dollars that are in the hands of the Arabs.

of recent bank-loan statistics, he says they have been impacted by some unusual events. He lists "the inability of secondary companies to raise money in the commercial paper market or through long-term debt issues, the lifting of price controls and fear of credit rationing.”
Lessen Loan Demand
Borrowing costs approaching 15%, considering compensating balances. Mr. Durham says, will lessen loan demand and bring short-term interest rates down.
In its portfolios, he notes, Delaware Management "generally favors securities yielding 7rr to 8% with well-covered dividends and selling at five to seven times earnings.” It likes computer, chemical, steel, airline and interest-sensitive issues.
Timothy J Sullivan, vice president and economist of Arohold & S. Bleichroeder Inc., which guides nearly $100 million, observes: 'Everyone is trying to protect himself from a financial panic and that’s how you bring one on." Indicative of the "stress being placed on quality,” he says, is that the Treasury bill rate is about four percentage points below the certificate of deposit rate and six percentage points below the Eurodollar rate.
Odds on a recession occurring, he thinks, are rising daily, with the likelihood it'll be “an old-fashioned inventory-reducing recession." He adds that concern about bankruptcies is at the highest point of the post-war period.
Loan statistics reported in recent months by New York City and Chicago banks have been "overstating loan demand,” suggests Jack Cox, partner and economist of Purcell, Graham & Co. He says that a crisis of uivestor confidence enabled these banks to “capture a greater share of all markets-from regional banks and also the corporate bond market, the commercial paper market and from the Eurodollar market.” While New York City and Chicago outstanding bank loans rose to $51.2 billion on July 3 from $47.5 billion on May 1, all other major bank loans fell to $73.4 billion from $74.1 billion.
