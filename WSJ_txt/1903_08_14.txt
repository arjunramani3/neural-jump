FEATURES OF THE MARKET.
Strong Close After a Further Substantial
A GOOD ADVANCE.
"A Strong Close After a Further Substantial Rally.
The Txmdon market was somewhat irregular' but showed • strength in.places. and prices, after some hesita-iicii : caused by the reactionary tendency of Reading, which had been tlie market leader, developed strength in all/departments. The professional element was disposed to/go with the current and the large supply of commission’house buying orders indicated how strong the cur-rent was. The advance was practically continuous throughout the day, and although there were momentary lulls, - caused by the taking of profits, there was no reaction of importance -anywhere. The specialists had no selling orders on their books worth mentioning. Stock which had been bought to protect was really absorbed. Tlie moderate, profit-taking for foreign account had scarcely any market effect, and at the close the? active stocks were selling at practically the best prices of the day with the buying power clearly unexhausted. It is .generally remarked that then? is no news in a bull market; and there was nothing in the tendency of money or exchange to account for the upward movement, while an improvement in wheat, is hardly n bull argument. The public was buying stocks and was satisfied with the fact that even with the week's rally they were many points ^below the figure n.t which they sold last .Tanuary.
The railroad stock® moved together, mid it is sufficient to say that Union Pacific. Missouri Pacific,* New York Central. St. Paul, and Atchison common gained over three points, while twvpoint advances were common. and*with the exception of Pending common all th-railroad list was substantially higher. All the industrials advanced, with special strength in the coppci stocks and large gains in the United States Steel issues and American Sugar. The tractions were firm and all showed good advances on very moderate transactions.
GENEKAL INFLUENCES
Harris, Gates Co. gave out selling orders in some quantify round the room.
The expected early session of congress was n favorable factor in general sentiment.
The strength in the market was probably largely due to frightened shorts, and apparently both Mr. Keene and his friends and the up-town clement were bulling stecks on the technical position.
A careful canvass of some twenty of the principal specialists made i: clear that, there were no selling orders in their hands. The general feeling on tlie floot was that all the stock bought to protect had come out and been absorbed.
• There was an active day’s trading in bonds and a substantial improvement in the more speculative issues. Steel fis. Wabash Bs and the convertible issue* all gained ground, and there was.a gr»udl demand for bond- «»f the higher grades. Government issues were steady without much feature. Total .~ale- $3j’CO.Oo»».
Whatever its general effect- on public sentiment might be. the street regarded the practical rejection ot the Panama Canal, or nt least tin* killing of it b.v amendments in Colombia, ns a big bull argument. It wa> pointed out that railroad stocks were affected by the passing of the bill here. ami in any ens,» the fact, that the. treasury would not have x«> pay out $50,000,000 this fall meant important case to the money market.
London bought a little «tnck nt. the opening, but out of 30.000 shares dealt hi probably sold 20,000. The foreign purchases were, all made at, lower prices and during lhe~w*<£st^af the depression of Inst week represented out of the most important sources of support. It was natural that tlie traders on the other side should take profits, and the disposition among the foreign clement was rather to wait for a reaction than to follow the? market up.•

Baltimore Ar Ohio recovered all >i< dividend of 2% in one day. which is the* first time *nch an incident ha* occurred for nearly a year. It is true People’s Gas did almost as well, but the dividend was not a* much.
The early session of congress was regarded as a bull {argument on Sugar. There was some suspicion that Now York Central was being marked up with nn eye to the effect <if higher price* on the necessary terminal financing.
Now that S<»uthon Pacific* ha* drifted into what may Ifairly be called the right hands,-there* is some reason f*»r {thinking that a dividend on it is a very different proposition to what it was when tlie Iv'cik* pool was in existence.

rumored that the Standard Oil interest was a
recent buyer of stocks for collateral against new Ioans of $12,000,000.	•
It wiw generally admitted that Standard Oil purchases had been the principal factor in starting the Reading movement, but the character of the buying later poems to have been moro speculative. It was thought unlikely that the Bockefdler® would cliinl» for stock.
It is probably within the mark to any that the Morgan interest has taken 200,000 shares of Steiff common in the past seven days. It was expected that this would come out when the market hardened, but there is reason to believe that the purchnsng wore nut made merely to protect the price.
The appearance of the Lewisohn .brokers in Amalgamated Copper on Thursday was probably the basis fot the bullish sentiment on that stock and Smelters. It is known that there were v»»ry large deliveries of Amalgamated Copper to Standard Oil sources in the recent past and*the Smelters outlook is considered very satisfactory in trade circles.
