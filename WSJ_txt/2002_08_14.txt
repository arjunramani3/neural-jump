Wal-Mart Stores fueled blue-chip strength after the retailer certified its financial statements and announced that it has authorized a $5 billion buyback program. In addition, Wal-Mart jumped on the corporate bandwagon and said it will begin expensing stock options for the fiscal year beginning in February. Wal-Mart rose 3.91, or 8%, at 52.62.
That optimism drove heavy buying of S&P-index futures and large program trades in the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock, or QQQ, which jumped 6.4%. The Nasdaq 100 index itself rose 6.8% to 968.86.
Oil-related stocks did well after an American Petroleum Institute report showed a big drop in crude-oil inventories last week. Dow industrials component Exxon Mobil climbed 1.55, or 4.4%, to 36.39, while oil-equipment provider Baker Hughes moved up 1.84, or 7.1%, to 27.70. Baker Hughes extended gains in the afternoon after its executives certified the company's financial statements.

NEW YORK -- It is as if Tuesday's losses never happened.
After sluggishly drifting lower early in the session as investors tried to digest the Federal Reserve's bearish view of the economy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a reversal in the last couple of hours of trading that obliterated Tuesday's decline and sent the industrial average soaring 260.92, or 3.08%, to 8743.31.
Wal-Mart Stores fueled blue-chip strength after the retailer certified its financial statements and announced that it has authorized a $5 billion buyback program. In addition, Wal-Mart jumped on the corporate bandwagon and said it will begin expensing stock options for the fiscal year beginning in February. Wal-Mart rose 3.91, or 8%, at 52.62.
While the industrial average was an eye-catcher, the session really belonged to the Nasdaq Composite Index, which jumped 65.01, or 5.12%, to 1334.29 as investors began to hunt for bargains among the most beaten-down technology sectors.
What caused the late-day turnaround? A slew of reasons, including relief that executives are putting their stamps of approval on their companies' financial statements.
That optimism drove heavy buying of S&P-index futures and large program trades in the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock, or QQQ, which jumped 6.4%. The Nasdaq 100 index itself rose 6.8% to 968.86.
Among the techs, semiconductors picked up steam late in the session. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index climbed 7.8%. That turned around stocks that had reason to fall. Applied Materials rose 96 cents, or 7.1%, to 14.42, even though the company's chief financial officer said that orders are expected to decline 5% to 15% in the current quarter.
Still, Wall Street remains skeptical about the stock market, especially with big events like the Fed meeting and Securities and Exchange Commission certification deadline out of the way. "Much of the market action has been futures-driven with some short covering," said Henry Mulholland, head of listed trading at Merrill Lynch. "But part of the reason we're drifting higher is the absence of any real negative stories on the horizon."
While most of the market rallied, airline stocks continued to lag. Fear is running rampant in the industry that other carriers could follow US Airways in filing for bankruptcycourt protection, and hopes have dwindled for a government bailout of the industry. UAL fell 29 cents, or 11%, to $2.45; Southwest Airlines shed 87 cents, or 6.9%, to 11.73; and AMR dropped six cents, or 0.7%, to 8.68.
Weakness in airlines spilled over to a number of companies with aerospace involvement, including Dow industrials components United Technologies, which fell 1.12, or 1.8%, to 61.35, and Boeing, which dropped 71 cents, or 1.9%, to 36.35.
Oil-related stocks did well after an American Petroleum Institute report showed a big drop in crude-oil inventories last week. Dow industrials component Exxon Mobil climbed 1.55, or 4.4%, to 36.39, while oil-equipment provider Baker Hughes moved up 1.84, or 7.1%, to 27.70. Baker Hughes extended gains in the afternoon after its executives certified the company's financial statements.
Network Appliance jumped 1.95, or 28%, to $9 after the data-storage product maker reported earnings of five cents a share on revenue of $207 million during its latest quarter, beating Wall Street expectations by a penny.
Paper makers lost ground after Deutsche Bank reduced its ratings on several companies in the sector, saying that some European markets are seeing rising inventories with weakening demand. Bowater fell 2.55, or 6%, to 39.70, while Pope & Talbot fell 1.53, or 10%, to 13.76. International Paper eked out a gain of seven cents, or 0.2%, to 39.46.
Household International eased 29 cents, or 0.8%, to 38.09. The Prospect Heights, Ill., consumer-finance concern restated its net-income figures dating back to 1994 to cover changes in how the company accounts for some credit-card contracts.
Vivendi's American depositary shares dropped 3.67, or 24%, to 11.66, falling to a 52-week low. Standard & Poor's warned that the French media company's credit rating could fall further if the company doesn't secure a credit line by next month.
