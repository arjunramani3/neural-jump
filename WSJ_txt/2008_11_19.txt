Stocks slid to fresh bear-market lows amid renewed fears that government is running out of ammunition to stabilize the financial system and the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427.47 points, or 5.1%, to 7997.28, its lowest close since March 2003. It has fallen 30% since mid-September, when Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection, and is down nearly 40% this year.
Financial stocks led the market lower. Citigroup fell 23% to its lowest close since 1995. Bank of America fell 14%.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.1% to 806.58, led by an 11.2% slide in its financial group.
Insurers, which have been scrambling recently to garner a bigger share of the federal money set aside for the financial industry, contributed to the sector's decline. Hartford Financial Group dropped nearly 29% and American International Group fell 20%.
The S&P is about 30 points from the 2002 low that marked the end of the last bear market. The Dow industrials are about 700 points above their 2002 low.
Major stock-market indexes flirted with gains in the morning but declined steadily after reports that new residential construction fell to a record low in October, the Consumer Price Index posted its biggest decline in 61 years, and minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate meeting showed that policy makers expect the recession to last at least through the first half of 2009.
"The government is going to find it difficult to do anything between now and Jan 20 -- and Jan. 20 seems like a lifetime away," said Todd Steinberg, head of equities and derivatives for the Americas at BNP Paribas.
Without any expectations of aggressive government action in coming weeks, buyers have even less reason to step in even if they think stocks are cheap, Mr. Steinberg added.
Executives from the U.S. auto makers were met with skepticism as they pleaded with House members for a bailout, a day after testimony to the Senate.
Shares in General Motors fell 9.7% to their lowest close since 1943. Ford Motor fell 25%.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index, which uses options prices to gauge investors' nervousness about coming market swings, leapt nearly 10% to finish above 70 for the first time since Oct. 27, when the Dow set its previous closing low.
The market's decline picked up speed in the afternoon. "People are having to re-evaluate entire investment programs," said Randy Bateman, chief investment officer for Huntington Funds. "We're having bear markets and bull markets these days that last 15 minutes at a time."
Stocks that fell outnumbered those that gained by a ratio of 15-to-1 among New York Stock Exchange-listed shares.
Investors fled to the safety of Treasury securities. The yield on the three-month note fell to near zero and on the two-year note hit 1.110%, its lowest since mid-June 2003.
Oil futures fell 1.4% to $53.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the fourth consecutive decline and down 63% from their July record in New York, following a report of rising inventories amid weak demand.
