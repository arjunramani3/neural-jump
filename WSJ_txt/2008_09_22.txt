Stocks gave back Friday's gains, Treasury prices declined and the dollar fell as the U.S. government's bailout plan failed to reassure investors.
Financial stocks led the declines amid concerns that the rescue plan doesn't resolve all the uncertainty and the sale of troubled assets to the government could lead to more write-downs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose nearly 369 points Friday, finished Monday down 372.75 points, or 3.3%, at 11015.69. J.P. Morgan Chase fell more than 13% and Bank of America shed 8.9%.
"It would be naive to think we're going to continue to go up in a straight line," said Robert Weissenstein, chief investment officer for private banking at Credit Suisse. "People are still trying to understand what this all means. You're talking about some truly extraordinary developments."
Longer-term Treasury yields rose in response to lower prices, as investors worried about the cost of the bailout and the prospect of higher inflation. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 4.406%.
The IntercontinentalExchange's U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar's value against six foreign currencies, fell 1.9%.
Oil futures soared as the dollar was hammered, finishing with a 16% gain in New York at $120.92 a barrel. Expiration of contracts for October delivery added volatility to the market, traders said. Contracts for November delivery rose 6.4% to $109.37.
Gold futures, a traditional safe haven in times of uncertainty, jumped $43.30, or 5%, to $903.90 per ounce in New York.
