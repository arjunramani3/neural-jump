Wall Street Journal (1889-1922); Feb 10, 1910; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Wall Street pg. 4
CLOSED STRONG AND ACTIVE.
Large gains were scored at the opening and throughout the session ail the leading stocks showed substantial strength. Sales 905,744 shares.
From start to finish the market showed substantial strength and towards the end of the day, it even exhibited some degree of buoyancy. The supply of stocks was small and, generally, buyers had to bid for what they wanted. The demand was heavy at the start, but slackened after the first hour, only to become pronounced again towards the close. Indications pointed to a heavily oversold condition, but the bears, because of the difficulty of obtaining stocks made little progress with covering operations, as they suspended their buying at times when the market advanced too sharply. The day brought forth little that was new but there was nothing whatever of a disturbing nature in the news and in the afternoon cables received by international banking houses said that the Bank of England would probably reduce its rate besides making a satisfactory statement for the week. The statement of earnings of the New York Central lines for December was considered good, and in railroad circles, generally, an optimistic view was taken of the outlook for business. Conservative banking interests expressed the opinion that stocks were cheap at the prevailing level, practically everything of an unfavorable nature of which the Street has been apprehensive, having been fully discounted by the recent decline. As al! the anticipated developments of an unfavorable nature will hardly turn out as unfavorable as apprehended, and as some of them may prove to be the reverse of unfavorable, there may be reasons why prices should improve substantially.
Large initial gains.
' Great strength and activity prevailed at the opening, leading stocks showing over night gains of from lh to 2 points or upward. This was a larger advance than had already been scored in I^>ndon, considering that the gains on the other side were in part the result of the fact that stocks bought in London now will not entail anything in the way of interest until lhe next settlement, or for about two weeks.
Steel opened with 10.(100 shares, at prices running from 76% to 76%, against a price of 75% at Tuesday's close, and a low of 75 on that day. The short interest was said to be very heavy.	'
Reading started with an advance of two points, this stock having been conspicuous for its strong action all through the recent decline. That something of more than ordinary consequence is in contemplation by the leading interests in this company is generally believed.
Such stocks as Wabash preferred, Chesapeake & Ohio and American Smelting & Refining which had behaved badly in the decline, started with gains of 1 % points or upwards, and Rock Island with a wide opening, covered a range from 44’i to 44■%, as against a closing price of 42% on Tuesday. The bnying of Rock Island recently has been of a significant kind.
The initial transaction in Southern Pacific was at 122’i. but was immediately followed by another at 123. The first transaction represented an advance of 1%, and the second a gain of 2’4 points. The buying of the stock since the price went to the neighborhood of 120 has been excellent.
Good buying.
Naturally, after such large initial advances as were scored through the active list, prices reacted somewhat, hut the declines were only fractional and the buying of stocks was if anything better on the recession than on the bulge, when a great part of it represented the urgent covering of shorts.
Great activity prevailed in United States Steel, and tiu stock showed strength in marked contrast, to its weakness of tho past few days. The preferred responded well to the advance in the common.
Amalgamated Copper started with an advance of 2% points and showed ability to maintain its gain. The sharp decline in tile stock just before Tuesday’s close was generally regarded as the result of a bear raid, and the short interest in this issue was said to be very extensive. Utah Copper scored an advance relatively greater than that ia Amalgamated.	'
Although the initial advance in Union Pacific was not relatively as great as that in many other active stocks, it was improved upon steadily in succeeding sales, the price continuing to move tip even when a slight reaction was in progress elsewhere.
A small volume of buying sufficed for a considerable rise in Consolidated Gas, and the impression of those who closely observed the trading in this issue, both since the opening ar.d on Tuesday afternoon, was that the suppiy of the stock in the Street was very small al prevailing prices.
Urgency of deniand.
The market was very strong all through, the first hour, but its strength aroused :io enthusiasm among tho traders on the floor or the customers of commission houses, practically all of whom were out of stocks, while the majority of them were committed to the bear side.
It does not often happen that the man who wants to sell something gets a price higher than he asks, but this happened at the opening to numbers of customers of commission houses, whose orders sell at a fixed figure were reported back as executed at as much as a point above the limits fixed. This was strong testimony to the urgency of the demand. The selling on the opening strength left tlie commission house customers and most of the room traders without stocks.
The great strength in Union Pacific and United States Steel, always influential leaders, was a most important factor in the general rise. Nothing was heard about the alleged danger of strikes at the plants of the Steel Corporation. or of shading of prices for finished material; nor was there a recurrence of the rumors circulated about Union Pacific when that stock was weak.
AH of the tractions showed strength, and there was a revival of the report of buying of the Interborough-Metropolitan issues by prominent banking interests.
Bidding for .stocks.
In the early part of the second hour the market while quiet was still very strong and in nearly every case it was necessary for those who bought stocks to bid for what they wanted. Offerings were very small.
Some of the bear operators who had been strutting around the Street, full of pride in the success of their operations, did not display their usual confidence, and it was evident that even the least conservative of them had become apprehensive that their large paper profits, counted up into the millions, were in danger.
One of the best known brokers on the Exchange, a man who is a deep thinker and close analyst of conditions, described the selling on Tuesday as the worst he had ever seen, and although he did not classify the buying, he said it was hardly possible that it was not better than the selling.
The recurrence of strength in the copper issues, although not accompanied by any theory or rumor of “pending developments” was regarded as in a large degree helpful to the general market, since these issues had been quite generally looked upon as the weakest part of the whole list. Probably for the reason that they were so considered, they have become heavily oversold.
Advances sustained.
Trading was dull, but the market succeeded in maintaining practically ail of its advance during the second hour, notwithstanding that some of the traders had begun to play for a reaction. Customers of commission houses who had sold at the opening—when they thought the crest of the rise was reached—were in the mood to sell short after prices had advanced further.
It was natural after the rally had run the extent of from two to three points in active stocks that the market should hesitate, the gains made in about hours being sufficient for a whole session, and it was just as natural that traders, accustomed to operate for turns of a fraction, should begin to sell short when the upward movement gave signs of halting. The short interest was already large, but it was increased by selling that might be classed as of the weakest kind.	_
In some quarters the report on the Hocking Coal & Iron scandal was regarded as a market factor in having cleared up a number of matters of uncertainty which had deterred many conservative speculators from espousing the bull side.
Trading for foreign account was moderately active, the net result being purchase of about 20,000 shares on balance. There was no special feature.
A bullish opinion.
In the early afternoon dullness was the market’s main

before in its history. R would probably			cater	the aaar-
het for a large mnher of cars, but that the e				
companies, being well filled with orders.			are rather stiff	
in their views regarding prices.				
Northern Pacific's January statement will present a				
sharp contrast to that for December and will				aake the
better showing which the road has ever made for the cor-				
responding month. Officers of the company are optimistic				
regarding the outlook, and	it is absolutely certain that			
there will be a heavy movement of immigration into the				
road's territory in the current year.				
A representative of one of the most prominent capi-				
talistic groups in New York expressed the opinion that				
the market is in excellent shape, and that stocks bought				
at prevailing prices will show substantial enhancement				
of value within the next few months.				
Another advance.				
Although the market continued dull into the late af-				
ternoon, it became very strong and decidedly more active				
toward the close, the leading stocks making in the last half				
hour their highest points of the day. There was good				
buying practically ail through the list, and a considerable				
amount of short covering in many places.				
New York Central made a good response to the state-				
ments of earnings for December, which,			considering the	
unfavorable weather in that month,		were considered high-		
ly satisfactory.				
As Smelters in the present week sold lower				than at
any time in 1909, it was argued that on general principles.				
the stock should be considered cheap and that there was a				
large short interest in it to	help along the advance. A			
similar argument was used	n the	case of Amalgamated		
Copper with good success.				
Reading's consistent strength continued, bringing the				
price of the stock above 160	for the first time			since the
rally started. Attention has been		favorably directed tn		
the stock by the fact that its action during the declin				
was much better than that of any of the other high priced				
active issues.				
Great Northern Ore, although dealt in			only on a com-	
paratively small scale, showed	a large recovery, and it was			
said that there had been little liquidation			and much short	
selling of the certificates in the past		week.
