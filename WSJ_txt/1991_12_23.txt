Staff Reporter of The Wale Street Journal new YORK—The stock market rocketed upward in a startling pre-holiday rally that caught many professional investors by surprise.
Market watchers said much of the move was a delayed reaction to the sharp interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Friday, but anticipation of a year-end rally gave the move momentum.	■
"I think it’s all off the rate cut," said Joseph McAlinden, director of research at Dillon Read, referring to the Fed's reduction of the discount rate by a full percentage point, to 3.5%. "That kind of move is likely to have a very strong effect on the economy in 1992."
On Friday, however, many investors sat on the sidelines eyeing the rate cut with skepticism and wary of making moves on a day dominated by the influence of expiring stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.
Stocks were soft at yesterday’s opening, but soon began to rally. The buying fed steadily on itself through the morning and by early afternoon the rally's momentum was unstoppable.
By 2:45 p.m. EST, the gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had zipped past the 50-point mark, tripping the New York Stock Exchange’s circuit breakers that restrict program trading. But share prices continued to barrel higher, pushing the industrial average past the 3000 level before 3:30 p.m.
The industrial average peaked shortly before the close with more than a 96-point gain, and ended 88.10 points higher at
3022.58,	just 54.57 points from its record high of 3077.15.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index rose 9.78 to 396.82, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 5.00 to 218.13 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index jumped 9.19 to 372.42.
Advancing stocks beat declining stocks, 1,410 to 435, with 380 unchanged. Big Board preliminary volume totaled a whopping 228,730,000 shares, still less than Friday’s expiration-bloated 313,810,000 shares.
American Stock Exchange volume totaled 24,575,000 shares, compared with 29,325,000 Friday. There were 379 issues advancing, 262 declining and 254 unchanged. The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 3.71 to 370.93.
Traders said today’s move may have been magnified by year-end window dressing. Brad Weekes, manager of sales; trading at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, added that many money managers close their . books for the year today and are engaged in the traditional “mark, up" to help boost their performance.
Anticipation for such a Christmas week move had many investors poised to catch a year-end rally.
“Everybody’s buying, not just insurance companies or hedge funds, it’s everybody," said Thomas Gallagher, managing director in charge of capital commitment at Oppenheimer & Co.
But despite the heavy volume, Dillon Read’s Mr. McAlinden warned that many major players are absent this week.
“A lot of people aren't in and it's not entirely clear how much of this is going to stick," said Mr. McAlinden. He cautioned
that a year-end rise might invite profit-taking early in 1992.
"My view is that we could very easily get another leg down in the correction that started in November," said Mr. McAlinden. But he said he is confident that low interest rates will work their magic on the economy.
Mr. McAlinden said he is revising his 1992 target for the industrial average upward into the 3,500 to 3,700 range from the 3,300 to 3,400 range estimated earlier.
Jeffrey Kaminsky, head of block trading at Mabon Securities, said the rally swept all sectors of the market higher—but lifted cyclical stocks the most.
“This was a broad based rally, but the groups at the top are Industries that will turn around coming out of this recession,” said Mr. Kaminsky.
Indeed, cyclical stock ignited yesterday. Caterpillar rallied 2% to 41%, Dresser Industries rose 1% to 18%, International Paper jumped 4% to 67% and Aluminum Co. of America rose 2% to 62.
Even the troubled Big Three car makers posted gains. Chrysler added 1% to 11%, General Motors jumped 1% to 29% and Ford rose 2% to 27%.
Among the airlines, UAL surged 7’4 to 137%, AMR jumped 6% to 68%, Delta Air Lines rose 2% to 62% and USAir jumped 1% to 11%.
Orion Pictures added % to 2‘4. Metromedia, its largest shareholder, and New Line Cinema have submitted a reorganization proposal to Orion, which sought protection from its creditors in bankruptcy court earlier this month. New Line Cinema rose % to 15% on the American Stock Exchange.
Commodore International jumped 2% to 14%. Financial journalist Dan Dorfman reported that Commodore is the No. 1 stock pick for 1992 of Standard & Poor’s Corp, computer analyst Larry Freitag.
Raymond James Financial fell % to 29. Michael Murphy, publisher of a popular newsletter for short sellers, is bearish on the stock because of the brokerage firm's links to Cascade International, which became subject of an Securities and Exchange Commission investigation after its financial statements were found to be flawed and its chairman disappeared.
Frontier Insurance gained 1% to 26%. Smith Barney Harris Upham initiated research coverage pf the stock with a "buy” rating.
Syntex rallied 4% to 46%. The company received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to market its Tora-dol-Oral drug for limited duration use to treat pain.
Beverly Enterprises added % to 9%. The company's chief financial officer, Andre C. Dimitriadis, said he will resign during the second quarter of 1992.
Storage Technology fell 3 to 37%. The company said test shipments of its new disk-drive product will now be made in the second quarter of 1992, rather than the first quarter as earlier planned.
Kaufman & Broad surged 2% to 17'4 after agreeing to buy 118 home sites from Calprop Corp.
Rite-Aid rose % to 20% after reporting fiscal third-quarter net Income of 29 cents a share, up from 26 cents a year earlier.
Primerica jumped 2% to 36. The company announced that it plans to buy back up to 3 million more of its shares.
