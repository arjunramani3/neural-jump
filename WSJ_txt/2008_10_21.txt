Oil prices fell amid concerns that an expected production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can't overcome weak demand in a global economic slowdown.

Stocks finished lower as a dim outlook for corporate earnings and the economy overcame signs that credit conditions are improving.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped 413.21 points Monday as credit markets appeared to be thawing, gave back 231.77 points Tuesday. It closed down 2.5%, at 9033.66, just off its low for the day.
Profit jitters were most visible in the technology and energy sectors after tech companies reported weak quarterly results. Oil prices fell amid concerns that an expected production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can't overcome weak demand in a global economic slowdown.
Oil futures fell 4.5% to $70.89 a barrel, down more than 51% from the record high on July 3.
Of 30 Dow components, 25 fell. DuPont led the declines, falling nearly 8% after reporting disappointing earnings and cutting its outlook for the year. Hewlett-Packard lost 7.2% after rival Sun Microsystems late Monday warned of a deep quarterly loss. Chevron and Exxon Mobil both fell more than 4%.
The tech-stock-led Nasdaq Composite index fell 4.1%. The S&P 500 was off 3.1% at 955.05.
The third quarter is likely to be the fifth consecutive period of declining earnings once all profit reports are in hand.
"In the next few quarters, I think we could get earnings much lower than everyone now expects" because of the economic downturn, said David P. Prokupek, chief executive of the Denver money-management firm Geronimo Partners, adding that he is steering his clients away from stocks.
Despite concern about earnings and the economy, intrabank lending rates dropped to the lowest levels in more than a month.
Gold, usually considered a safe haven, slipped 2.7% to $766.10 an ounce amid a broad selloff in commodities. Copper contracts slid 5.3%, to $2.007 a pound, the lowest close in nearly three years.
The decline in stocks was the 12th in 15 trading days this month. The Dow is down nearly 17% in October.
