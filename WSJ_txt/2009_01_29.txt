Stocks staged a broad retreat, erasing all of Wednesday's gains, as the latest economic data gave investors a case of buyers' remorse.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 226.44 points, or 2.7%, to 8149.01, ending a three-day winning streak. Financials reversed course to lead the decline as Bank of America slid 8.3%, J.P. Morgan Chase fell 8.1% and Citigroup was off 7.1%. Of 30 Dow components, 27 finished lower.
Traders are skeptical about the government's latest stimulus package, said Alan Valdes, a trader at Hilliard Lyons. "It's not the right approach, and you're seeing the market react to it," he said. "We need to create jobs . . . this is an economy powered by consumer spending."
The market's slide began at the opening bell, after the Labor Department reported that the tally of continuing claims for unemployment benefits rose to its highest level since the government started keeping track in 1967. Several big corporations announced job cuts, including Eastman Kodak.
Other reports showed that new-home sales fell to a record low and durable-goods orders dropped 2.6% last month.
Boeing fell 5.9% after Standard & Poor's took the first step to potentially cutting its credit rating, saying the aviation market was deteriorating and financing terms for customers could get tougher.
The S&P 500 index fell 3.3% to 845.14, led by an almost 8% decline in its financial sector. Its energy sector slid 3.5% as oil futures slid 1.7% to $41.44 a barrel.
Treasury prices fell, sending yields to their highest levels in two months.
