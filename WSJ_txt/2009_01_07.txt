Stocks fell as job cuts at Alcoa and a profit warning from Intel rudely awakened investors to the corporate-profit slowdown.
A private-sector survey from Automatic Data Processing foreshadowed more losses in the December jobs report that is expected Friday.
Alcoa was the biggest loser on the Dow, falling $1.23, or 10%, to $10.89. The aluminum maker said it was eliminating 15,000 jobs, among other moves, to cope with the prolonged recession.
Intel (Nasdaq) took the wind out of the sails of the technology sector. Shares of the chip maker shed 93 cents, or 6.1%, to 14.44. Intel expects revenue to fall by 20% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, blaming weakened demand and computer-maker efforts to clear excess inventory. That was its second warning on the quarter.
Computer chips are to some extent the currency of commerce, just as steel once was, and analysts said the warning speaks volumes about the economic outlook worldwide.
A prominent Indian businessman was the latest to rattle investors' confidence.
American depositary shares of Satyam Computer Services were halted for trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the Indian outsourcing concern's chairman, Ramalinga Raju, admitted he had falsely inflated revenue and profit disclosures for several years. Premarket, shares fell as much as 84%.
"This proves the U.S. doesn't have a monopoly on crooks and cheats," said Robert Pavlik, market strategist at Banyan Partners. "Unfortunately, a good number of good corporations in India will be tainted by this [man's] dealings."
Some Indian issues were weaker: ICICI Bank's American depositary shares slid 2.93, or 13%, to 19.07. Some of Satyam's direct competitors fared better, however. Infosys Technologies (Nasdaq) tacked on 34 cents, or 1.3%, to 26.94; Wipro fell 15 cents, or 1.8%, to 8.26.
Monsanto surged 12.94, or 18%, to 86.16. The seed and weed-killer processor was a bright spot, rising as it boosted its outlook for the fiscal year. Monsanto was lumped in with some commodity stocks, though its business allows for more innovation than those that dig materials out of the ground.
Shares of Peabody Energy fell 2.97, or 10%, to 25.48. The world's largest publicly traded coal miner forecast lower production in the U.S. and Australia because of weaker demand.
Shares of chemical maker and Dow component DuPont fell 1.99, or 7.2%, to 25.66.
Dow Chemical tacked on three cents to 16.08 after its chief executive told investors the collapse of a deal with Kuwait didn't threaten its growth strategy.
Time Warner fell 1.09, or 4.8%, to 21.56. The media conglomerate said it was writing down $25 billion of assets in the fourth quarter to reflect the declining value of its cable, AOL Internet and magazine businesses. Time also warned 2008 operating earnings would come in below their prior target.
Banks and financial stocks sold off again as Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said banks would need to raise more capital this year and likely face downgrades of their credit ratings as a result. Securities on the banks' balance sheets will likely generate more write-downs in 2009.
Citigroup fell 31 cents, or 4.2%, to 7.15; Morgan Stanley declined 1.48, or 7.6%, to 18.10.
Shares of casino operators slid Wednesday, surrendering early-2009 gains as MGM Mirage scaled back a development in Las Vegas. Analysts also predicted more industrywide troubles in 2009.
Shares of MGM fell 1.44, or 9%, to 14.52. Competitor Las Vegas Sands declined 1, or 12%, to 7.40, and Wynn Resorts (Nasdaq) fell 8.05, or 15%, to 47.23
A depression play? Family Dollar Stores rose 3.48, or 14%, to 27.81 after the discounter boosted its fiscal-2009 profit outlook, benefiting from increased use of food stamps.
Overall, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 245.40 points, or 2.7%, to 8769.70, and is now down 0.1% for 2009. Tuesday's was the biggest drop for the Dow since Dec. 1.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 28.05, or 3%, to 906.65, wiping out all but 0.4% of its gains on the year so far. The S&P 500 is still up about 20% from its
low Nov. 20. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 53.32, or 3.2%, to 1599.06.

After a "Santa Claus rally" largely fueled by momentum and technical factors, Wednesday's round of data and layoffs forced investors to face the grim facts about the
economy, said the head trader at a Boston money manager.
"We got away from the euphoric bear-market rally and it's back to basics," the trader said. For a definitive turnaround in the market, "we need to see a change in the fundamentals before you can put some conviction behind the move," he added.
