Michigan Holiday Precipitates Decline
Wall Street was forced peeled shock in the shape of for the state of Michigan, peninsula, at the resumption day. The nows was sufficient to precipitate an abrupt and general retreat in the securities markets, which carried active stocks down as much as four points from Saturday’s final figures. A mild recovery, due in part to short covering, enabled the list to close above the day’s lows. Trading volume for the day ran -to 1,540.000 shares, the heaviest since January 11.
AU classes of domestic corporation bonds were heavy throughout the session. In the utility group, Detroit Edison issues were a weak spot. -and junior with stock lower. The ket was in	_	_
bonds were strong.
Wheat and cotton tumbled with the securities markets. Wheat closed 1 to 1 cents a bushel lower, while cotton finished steady, off 7 to 14 points on the day.
The developments in Michigan overshadowed all other news as a market factor. Governor Comstock’s statement, issued shortly after his proclamation ordering the holiday, which is to continue through February .21, made it clear that difficulties of one large institution made Immediate action imperative. While Wall Street has become inured to bank closings, and even moratoriums m fairly wide areas, the news from Michigan was so generally unexpected as to disturb the entire market.l Closings of some small institutions in Missouri. New Jersey and Pennsylvania, did not help matters.
Other Neus Submerged
Other weck-eqfi news attracted attention, but was submerged as a market influence. The statements in Washington of Bernard M. Baruch in regard to the -necessity of balancing the budget and maintaining the currency on a sound basis attracted wide interest, due to the fact that Mr. Baruch has for years been high m the counsels of the Democratic party and has been in numerous conferences with the President-elect recently. The death in the House of the measure which would have increased tariffs on imports from countries having depreciated currencies was hailed with relief.
Stocks opened lower, but losses at the start were not extensive. Volume of trading was large, however, and the list gave ground easily before the wave of selling. General Motors opened at IS*'**, off only half a point, but was driven down to a low of 11 ** in the morning, in very active trading. Chrysler, Electric Auto-Lite and stocks of other companies involved in the motor industry, with heavy investments in Michigan, all were weak.
Railroad stocks declined with the rest of the list. Some of the recent favorite*. like Louisville & Nashville and Delaware & Hudson, weic under severe pressure and gave ground easily For a time the gold mining company stocks showed some strength, but the finish found most of them lower.
Trading volume slackened in the afternoon, but the market showed no important recuperative power. Some short covering, particularly obvious in General Motors and Chrysler, enabled the list to rally slightly above the lows at the close.
Weakness prevailed on the Paris bourse, with practically all stocks giving ground. In London the market was irregular, with British bonds steady.
Davison Chemical
The receivership application directed against the Davison Chemical Co. is another chapter in the vicissitudes of a company which, in the early years of the last decade was one of the speculative favorites. Davison’s report for its fiscal year, ended June 30, last, aroused a good deal of comment in Wall Street. Among the charges against surplus was a write-off of $303,557 as “provision for loss on accounts due from former officer of subsidiary company,” and $705,284 as “provision for loss in realization of advances to president of company and interest thereon.”
Despite the fact that these two items received wide publicity, Davison Chemical's annual meeting of stockholders was a very quiet affair, with neither officers nor directors subjected to important questioning. There is still a good deal of speculation as to the two items.
The Great Northern’s Move
In seeking agreement ot its first and refunding bondholders to an extension of the maturity of the $41,963,000 St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba bonds, an underlying issue of the Great Northern which comes 'due July 1, the Great Northern is making the simplest move to take care of the maturity. In ordinary times, it would be easy to refinance the Manitoba maturity, but it is practically out of the question now, The only courses open to the road were an appeal to the Reconstruction Finance Corp, for aid or for an extension of the maturity.
Due to the indenture of the refundings, getting an extension for the Manitoba issue involved special steps. Article 4. Section 14. of the indenture of the refundings stated specifically that “the railway company shall not and will not extend, or suffer, or permit to be extended while any of the first mortgage bonds are outstanding, any bonds secured by any existing mortgage.”
First of all, the Great Northern must get the permission of the holders of the refundings to permit an extension, and then it must obtain the acquiesonce of the holders of the Manitoba bonds la tbe cxf.euslo». Tbexa w $33,668,000
of the refundings outstanding, and $36,332,000 pledged under the general mortgage. It will take time to win the backing of security holders to the plan and the Great Northern started early on its campaign.
Cotton Consumption Higher
The sizeable pick-up in cotton consumption in January over both January, 1032. and December of last year was an item of cheering news. The daily rate of domestic consumption in January was ahead of December, contrary to the usual seasonal trend. In the six seasons from 1922-23 to 1927-28, the average January rate was about 0.5% under the average December level. The increase shbwn in the past month over December was very slight, but it held some special significance, particularly in view of the fact that general manufacturing activity iu January was perhaps a shade lower than the level prevailing in December.
One big restraining influence on the cotton market at the present time is the fact that the carryover, on August 1, 1932, the beginning of the crop year, reached the record total of 13,323,000 bales. It will take a very large increase in domestic consumption and foreign demand to exhaust this carryover, unless this year’s crop is unusually short.	*
Surcharge Revenue*
There are only six weeks left before tbe surcharges granted by the Interstate Commerce Commission in January, 1932, to furnish funds tor impoverished roads, expire, unless they are extended by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Commission now is pondering the question. In view of the agitation for reduced rates, a number of the most stalwart advocates of the surcharges admit that there is little likelihood of their extension.
The chief sufferers as result of elimination of the surcharges would be the four eastern trunk lines. Pennsylvania in 1932 received in round numbers $7,604,000; New York Central lmes, $6,074,000; Baltimore & Ohio, $3,534,000, and the Chesapeake & Ohio, $2,362,000. In view of the fact that the surcharges do not apply on agricultural products, the western roads will not be so hard hit. The Atchison, for instance, received only roughly $1,667,000 m extra revenues m 1932, the Union Pacific $1,123,000, and the Great Northern $646,000.
If the surcharges are eliminated. April carrier earnings statements will not make very good reading, unless there is a good seasonal upturn in traffic.
