Dow-Jonet lait pap«.
Stocks underwent a sudden sinking spell yesterday, the entire list giving way before heavy selling pressure which carried the leaders down as much as 6 points. Bonds were reactionary throughout the session, but commodities, in the face of the weakness in the securities markets, gave a fairly good account of themselves. Wheat rallied from its earlier lows and closed unchanged to up an eighth. Cotton held steady most of the day, but eased near the close to finish off 4 to 9 points. *
±*Tom tne opening gong, the market was reactionary, and the close found stocks at or near the day's low point. In some speculative quarters, the candid statement of Montagu Norman on the world's financial difficulties was seized on as a reason for the precipitate selling of stocks. Atchison started out down more than 2 points; Telephone was off 1; Steel common was off a half, and du Font down three-eighths. The market showed no rallying power during the morning, and worked steadily lower, with volume of trading picking up on the decline.
In the early afternoon, the list steadied, and rallied feebly, but in the late trading the decline was resumed and continued Interrupted to the close. Telephone finished at 101%, off 5%; Steel common, at 35. was off 3% and the preferred, at 74, was down 4%. du Font was under severe pressure, slipping to 32%, off 4%. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western, which was one of the leaders In Thursday's mild rally in the rails, was heavily sold, losing almost 5 points and closing only a quarter above the day's low of 27%.
G. M. Report Disappointing
General Motors was heavy the entire session, and the quarterly eamLngs statement, which appeared just at the close of the market, emphasized the corporation’s problems in the past three months. The loss for the period was roughly $4,464,000, and for the nine months, net income was equal to only 8 -cents a common share, or 67 cents a share less than common dividend requirements for the period. A number of other corporation reports made their appearance during the session, and most of them were adverse. Lambert reacted on the quarterly report showing net equal to only 35 cents a share on the stock, for the September quarter, against $1.53 a share for the like 1931 period. Net for the nine months, however, was in excess of the current annual dividend requirements on the common.
The oils were neglected. Advances in the price of gasoline failed to bring any buying into the stocks. The rails were unable to resist the downward movement, and sold off easily. Union Pacific and Atchison were among the heaviest losers on the board.
Declines in stocks were wide, in view of the relatively small trading volume. Transactions reached 1.200,000 shares, higher than recent sessions but still not large.
Abroad, the markets were mixed. In Berlin, bonds moved forward while stocks ruled about unchanged. In Faris, the market was weak, while in London, the list was irregular.
weeks. Only once before this year has there been a two weeks* xise, and that was of considerably smaller proportions. Ordinarily, such an abrupt upturn can be attributed almost entirely to increased lending of “Federal Funds,** but bankers are of the opinion that a substantial part of the recent increase has been due to an actual rise in commercial borrowings.
This week's statement shows continued strengthening In the position of the 12 Reserve banks. Member banks paid off an additional $14,000,000 of indebtedness, and it is notable that this past week Chicago member banks paid off their entire Indebtedness. This Is the first Hing Chicago banks have been out of debt to the Reserve since March 25, 1931. The current indebtedness of all member banks at $314,000,000 is the lowest it has been at this time of year since 1924, with the single exception of 1930, and is less than a third of the indebtedness at the start of 1932.	.
Equally impressive has been the return of currency out of hoarding. Since Labor Day, currency in circulation has declined $104,000,000, which is much larger than the usual seasonal return flow. In the more normal years of 1929 and 1930, the return flows in this period were $11,000,000 and $40,000,000, respectively. In 1931, when hoarding was at its height, circulation rose $412,000,000 in the similar period.
Gasoline and Crude Oil Prices
Those companies which advanced crude oil prices in the southwest 10 to 12 cents a barrel on October 15 now are engaged in strengthening the gasoline market over a wide area, to compensate for the higher cost of crude. If the movement is on a sound basis and continues, it eventually will bring the Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard of Indiana into line on crude prices. Two price schedules on crude oil in the same area cannot be maintained for any length of time.
The Pick-Up in Tax Revenue
Figures made public by the Treasury Department, showing the pick-up in tax revenue under the new Revenue Act in September over August Illustrated the striking effect on the Government's income of a pick-up in business. The biggest gain, on a percentage basis, was in telephone, wire and cable messages. Taxes on them in September yielded over $1,300,000, against only $105,000 in August. Revenue from the check tax moved up more than 10%, but it is still far below Treasury estimates.

The Rail Price Reduction
Railroad officials are somewhat skeptical as to how much new business the reduction in the price of rails to $40 a ton from $43 a ton will bring into the steel companies. Some roads need rail, and would have entered the market for it at the normal time in any event, but there are a number which still have a supply of rail on hand. Then, too, many carriers simply haven't the money to buy rail, and will postpone purchases as long as possible, despite the price cut.
The cut in the price amounts to about 7%. To a road which purchases around 50,000 tons of rail in a normal year, it will mean a saving of $150,000, a tidy sum but hardly of extreme importance to a carrier like the Chasepeak e & Ohio, for instance, whose normal requirements run to such a tonnage. The steel companies, in making the cut, have followed the course taken by most other companies in reducing prices in line with changed ’conditions.
Montagu Norman’s Statement
The bearish interpretation put on the Montagu Norman speech by some speculative quarters hardly was borne out by a close reading of the address. While Mr. Norman candidly admitted the devastating effects of the depression, and the obstacles to recovery, he did not term the effects irreparable or the obstacles insuperable.
After talking of the difficulties in the way of recovery Mr. Norman said: “I hope we may all see and approach the light at the end of the tunnel, which some are already able to point out to us. I myself see it somewhat indistinctly. I admit that, for the moment, the way is not clear."	’
Mr. Norman's plea for international cooperation was a reiteration of similar pleas made by many bankers, who have pointed out that a prime requisite for world recovery is world cooperation.
The Bank Statement
The outstanding feature of this week’s bank statement was an $83,000,000 rise in total loans and investments of New York City banks. The gain, coming on top of a $127,000,000 rise in the previous week, brings the total to $6,989,000,000, or $704,000,000 above the year’s low point. The figure is now practically the same as at this time In 1928, whereas at one time in 1932 it was roughly $900,000,000 below 1928 levels.
An encouraging feature has been a $68,000,000 rise in "all other" loanp in the past two
