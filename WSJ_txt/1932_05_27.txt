chases of Governments is determined by other factors which affect excess reserves.
The shifting of the assets of the Reserve System was another interesting feature of the weekly statement Holdings of governments by Reserve banks outside New York were increased substantially, through transfer of governments from New York. Gold reserves In New York thus were increased more than $100,000,000, while gold reserves in centers outside New York were reduced. The transfer of gold from other centers to New York was to offset the loss in metal suffered as result of shipments abroad. Most of the buying of governments has been done through New York, and these securities were transferred to other centers in exchange for gold.	• i
The apathy of an extremely dull pre-holiday stock market was shaken by a 60%<re-duction In the General Electric quarterly dividend, and stocks in the last half of yesterday's session worked steadily downward, with leaders showing losses ranging from fractions to more than four points. Government bonds were strong and worked higher in the latter part of session on heavy trading, but the remainder of the bond list was irregular. Grains were down, and cottan was off 8 or 10 points on the day.
Not all the day's news was adverse, but the cut In the General Electric dividend over* shadowed other developments. Announcement was made that *sheet steel prices probably would be raised $1 a ton for third quarter delivery, and makers of wire products were reported considering a price advance. The increase in finished products would follow an advance of $2 a ton in bars, slabs and billets, and would be & much more important step from a revenue producing standpoint.
Prospects that receivership for the St. LouisSouthwestern could be averted were materially Improved by word from St. Louis, received late in the day, that a financial institution in that city had deposited a large block of bonds with the management which would practically insure carrying out the road’s refinancing plan. The Cotton Belt 4s rushed up 10 points, and the rest of the rail bond list firmed a little in the last few minutes of trading.
The threat of receivership for the Cotton Belt has been one of the factors in depressing the railroad bond list, and its removal would be helpful.
Introduction of a general sales tax amendment to the tax bill was the high light of the day's activities In the Senate. Sales tax advocates claim a majority of the Senate for the measure, and House sentiment is swinging toward it, according to reports. A vote in the Senate on the general shies tax Is forecast before the end of next week. A statement issued by a group of senators, including leaders of both parties, assuring the country that the budget would be balanced, had a beneficial effect on prices for government bonds.
Market Follows General Electric Down
Interest in the stock market was practically non-existent in the morning. Trading was extremely dull, with transactions in the first half hour only half of the total in the first half hour on Thursday. Announcement of the cut in the General Electric dividend, however, brought greater activity. General Electric common tumbled sharply, and closed the day at 10, off 2]£ points. Westinghouse reacted sympathetically, losing more than 4 points.
Beech Nut Packing took a sharp tumble, losing 5 points on transactions involving around 2.000 shares. Drug was under pressure most of the session, and Consolidated Gas slipped to a new low in the late trading. American Telephone also closed at the bottom, and set a new low.
The market continued to demonstrate that without definite, favorable word from Washington. adverse business news would be translated into lower prices for securities. Many quarters suggest that commitments be .withheld for the time being.
Drop In Circulation Feature of Reserve Report
The decline in circulation outstanding in the week ended May 26 was a feature of the latest weekly report of the Reserve System. In the week, circulation was down $39,000,000, compared with an increase of $18,000,000 in the preceding week. In the week ended May 27, 1931, circulation was down only $5,000,000 from the preceding week.
In the three weeks ended May 18, circulation showed a net increase of $51,000,000, leading to renwed fears that hoarding in volume had begun once more. The sharp reduction In Circulation tn the latest week served to allly these fears. Circulation still is $776,000,000 above the total outstanding as of May 27, 1931.
While the system’s purchase of Governments has reduced in the week, it does not indicate a cessation of the policy of controlled credit expansion. The system's program is designed to keep excess reserves at in the neighborhood of $300,000,000, and the amount of its pur-
Rail Averages Off 01.6% From 1920 High
Old-time market maxims have taken a terrible thumping during the long period of deflation in securities. One of them, “Never sell a dull market," proved extremely expensive to those who followed it. Another theory, that the deflation bottom should not be much below 50%, on the Averages, from the high of the prosperity era peak, has been proved conclusively wrong.
At Thursday's closing, the Dow-Jones average of 20 railroad stocks was down 91.6% from the high of 189.11 set September 3, 1929. The average of 30 industrials was off approximately 87% from the high made on the same date, and the drop in the utility average from the 1929 peak was roughly 86%.
The deflation in stocks has gone so far that the posRibilities of profit on the short side of the market are definitely limited. While there are no signs of business recovery, the declines in prices of many stocks have far outrun the declines in earning power of the companies the securities represent
Outflow of Gold Likely to Continue
The outflow of gold from this country is likely to continue in the near future. Insofar as this represents withdrawal of foreign central bank balances in this country, the movement is not regarded with concern. It represents, in part at least, desire on the part of central banks to abandon the exchange standard, which permitted foreign banks of issue to include the balances which they held in gold standard counties as the base for their own currency backing, and really permitted the double use of gold. Withdrawal of this gold, which actually never was ours, will remove a threat which has had a depressing influence.
So far as maintenance of the gold standard by this country is concerned, removal of these balances, alone, will not threaten it. With the Glass-Steagall bill in effect. It would require a combination of circumstances to force us off the gold basis.
