NEW YORK -- Blue-chip stocks soared after economic data eased some inflation worries. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 257.36 points -- its biggest-ever singlesession advance -- in the first day of trading after Labor Day.
The move eclipsed a record set nearly 10 years ago. Coincidentally, both the new title holder and the session it surpassed -- a 186.84-point advance that occurred Oct. 21, 1987 -- came as the stock market worked to recovery from preceding losses.
A host of consumer-products names led the advance, with Procter & Gamble jumping 4 7/8 to 138, Merck rallying 3 7/8 to 95 11/16, and Coca-Cola rising 2 9/16 to 59 7/8.
Those stocks were among the issues that came under sharp pressure in August, a month marked by volatile trading and sharp losses as investors cashed in blue chips and shifted to smaller names. The month marked one of the industrial average's worst ever. Marked by a lack of liquidity, the dominance of program trading, and a poor technical performance, the industrials lost 7.7% from their Aug. 6 high of 8259.31 to Friday's close of 7622.42.
The industrials didn't recoup all those losses yesterday, but with traders and investors back in force after August vacations, much of the loss was erased. The gain of 257.36 represented a rise of 3.38%, as the industrial average finished the session at 7879.78, its highest close since Aug. 22.
There were 2,177 issues advancing, 751 declining and 479 unchanged. Volume totaled 491.8 million shares, compared with 407 million Friday.
A broad list of stocks showed sharp improvement in the session, including several technology names: Microsoft (Nasdaq) rose 5 to 137 3/16, Motorola added 3 1/4 to 76 5/8, and Texas Instruments advanced 4 1/8 to 117 3/4.
Transportation stocks rose. Among airlines, AMR advanced 2 11/16 to 103 7/16, Delta Air Lines moved ahead 2 1/16 to 88 9/16, and UAL gained 2 5/16 to 78 1/2.
Among rail stocks, Burlington Northern rose 1 3/4 to 93 7/16 and Norfolk Southern moved ahead 1 11/16 to 99 11/16, while transport-services provider Caliber System added 1 3/8 to 43 1/8.
Oil stocks moved up sharply. Exxon advanced 2 13/16 to 64, Mobil rose 2 3/4 to 75 1/2, Atlantic Richfield gained 2 7/8 to 77 7/8, and Texaco jumped 3 1/2 to 118 7/8.
"The rally today has been a very broad-based one," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Funds. "When you see the averages up this much, it indicates that everything is participating."
Investors might have been eager to put the turmoil of August behind them, when worries grew that the economy was overheating, even while some companies were forecasting coming profit weakness. The losses were exacerbated by sharp, volatile, momentum-driven moves, which frequently seemed to turn modest declines into sharp losses.
Some portfolio managers now are more sanguine. "I think we're seeing some mixed signals," Mr. Freedman said. "The liquidity is there, so as long as the economic environment is positive -- with low inflation and moderate growth -- we'll get through OK."
In fact, yesterday's gains were very directly the result of encouraging economic data, market watchers said.
"The market is going to hang on every piece of economic data this week to determine what that portends for the next Federal Reserve meeting," said Jeffrey Applegate, market strategist at Lehman Brothers. "Some people breathed a sigh of relief at today's data."
The highlight of the economic data in the session, the National Association of Purchasing Management's index for August, showed a decline from September levels, to 56.8% from 58.6% in July. Economists were expecting a decline, but were surprised by the size of the drop.
The data gave a lift to the Treasury market, which had labored through August. The rise in bond prices contributed to a rally in banking names.
Shares of Citicorp climbed 3 5/8 to 131 1/2, while Chase Manhattan added 2 9/16 to 113 3/4, J.P. Morgan shot up 4 5/16 to 111 13/16, CoreStates Financial climbed 3 1/8 to 64 5/8, State Street moved ahead 2 1/8 to 52, and Signet Banking advanced 1 1/16 to 52 7/8.
Analysts cited a host of reasons for the banking group's success, including recovery from some recent losses and the approach of earnings season. But one of the main reasons was enthusiasm for consolidation in the industry, following NationsBank's agreement last Friday to purchase Barnett Banks. Barnett shares gave up 1 3/8 to 66 3/4, while NationsBank slipped 1 to 58 3/4.

BankAmerica rose 4 1/2, or 6.8%, to 70 5/16, amid speculation that NationsBank may go after the San Francisco banking giant once it digests Barnett. NationsBank's chief executive, Hugh McColl Jr., told analysts yesterday that he is interested in moving into the California market. BankAmerica declined to comment.
Other banks that analysts identified as potential consolidation plays also participated in yesterday's rally.
BankBoston shot up 3 1/4 to 86 3/8, First Tennessee National (NASDAQ) rose 2 7/8 to 56 1/8, and First Chicago NBD moved up 3 1/4 to 75.
"Volatility will continue to be a watchword in the banking stocks," said Michael Mayo, bank-industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "But the group should benefit by moving closer to the quarterly earnings-reporting period, which have been favorable over the past year."
The broad-based nature of yesterday's rally showed up in the performance of broad-market indicators. The Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index shot up 28.11, or 3.13%, to
927.58.
The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 30.77, or 1.94%, to 1618.09.
The American Stock Exchange Composite Index added 6.71 points, or 1.03%, to a record 656.87.
Philip Morris advanced 1 5/8 to 45 5/16. The company was one of three major tobacco companies reported to have raised prices on cigarettes to help pay for liability settlements, analysts said. RJR Nabisco edged up 5/8 to 35 7/16 on reports it, too, planned to raise prices.
Among the rare losers in the session, Gateway 2000 lost 2 9/16 to 36 9/16. According to PaineWebber, the company may not meet Wall Street's third-quarter earnings forecasts.
Shares of King World Productions fell 11/16 to 39 1/16. Los Angeles television station KTLA, which is owned by Tribune Co., reported that Oprah Winfrey decided not to renew her contract with King World to do "The Oprah Winfrey Show" for the 1998-1999 season. Both King World and Winfrey's Harpo Productions denied the report.
Promus Hotel gained 1 15/16 to 40 3/4, while Doubletree (Nasdaq) lost 5 1/8 to 44 7/8. The hotel concerns agreed to merge in a $4.7 billion stock swap.
Philips Electronics' American depositary receipts moved up 4 13/16 to 76 7/16. The consumer-electronics maker reached an agreement that moved it closer to severing its ties to ailing German television manufacturer Grundig AG.
Superior TeleCom added 1 3/8 to 39 7/16. The maker of communications products said its Superior Telecommunication unit received a contract to supply GTE with $475 million in copper telephone cable and wire products through 2002.
Shares of GTE edged up 15/16 to 45 1/2.
Corestaff (Nasdaq) advanced 1 5/16 to 31 1/16 after Alex. Brown raised its rating on the stock.
C-Cube Microsystems (Nasdaq) added 2 1/2 to 32 1/2. Robertson Stephens boosted its rating on the stock of the digital-equipment maker.
New York Times Co. applied for a listing of its class A common shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said it expects the Class A shares to trade on the Big Board on Sept. 25, under the symbol NYT. Its class A shares rose 9/16 to 47 13/16 on the American Stock Exchange. The Class B shares of the company are not publicly traded.
