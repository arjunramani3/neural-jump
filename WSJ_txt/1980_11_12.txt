A spurt in International Business Machines stock reinforced a rally based on hopes interest rates will peak soon, and the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 20.90 points for its biggest gain in more than six months. Volume swelled to more than 58,000.000 shares.	'
The industrial, average, up 9.47 points at 3 p.m., more than doubled in the final hour to close at 964.93. The transportation index climbed 9.03 to 385.13, a record. The utility average also gained.
IBM moved up early in the session following its announcement of two new processors and improvements that extend the power and range of its largest computer systems. But the stock got its biggest push during the afternoon when news circulated that it had been strongly recommended by Morgan Stanley & Co. In active trading of more than one million shares the stock jumped 3% to 70%.
"The recommendation triggered sigmfi-cant buying and short covering in other computer and glamour stocks,” said Fred W. Lange, consultant to Colin Hochstin & Co. Traders buying stock to cover their short positions are purchasing shares to replace borrowed stock sold earlier.
The rise in the industrial average was the biggest since a 30.72-point climb April 22. '
"The apparent visibility of an interest rate peak and anticipation of what a Republican president can do for stocks” started the
market on its upward course early yesterday, Mr. Lange said.
“Stocks were responding to the rally this week in the credit markets and also were engaged in a delayed celebration of the Reagan victory,” commented Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc., St. Louis. "We are trying to pick stocks that can do well in a stagflation economy,” he added.
“Further response to the Reagan victory seemed to be bringing in investment money,” said Eldon A. Grimm, senior vice president at Birr, Wilson & Co. Larry Wachtel, first vice president at Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., said, “the key factor to remember is that institutions had been raising cash for about a month prior to the election.”
Allen Sinai, vice president and senior economist at Data Resources Inc., contended that "the prospects for good-sized declines of interest rates over the next few months have been greatly enhanced, despite the remaining high likelihood of some further rises in the prime and discount rates.” He said “the odds on a secondary dip in the economy now are overwhelming.”
Big Board Volume
Big Board volume, which totaled more than 14 million shares in the first hour and again in the final hour, amounted to 58,500,000 for the day, up from 41,520,000 in the prior session. Greater institutional activity was reflected in the 828 trades of 10,000 shares or more, up from 543 Tuesday.	, „
More than 1,200 New York Stock Exchange issues finished higher, three times the losers.
Domestic oil and defense stocks were particularly strong. Among active issues in the oil sector, Texaco climbed 2 to 42; Phillips Petroleum, 1% to 54%, and Gulf, 2% to 44%. Also higher were Superior, up 2 to 201; Cities Service, 2% to 48%; Conoco, 3% to 68%; Marathon, 6% to 76; Getty, 4% to
99; Shell, 3% to 56%; Standard Oil (Ohio), 4% to 78%; Indiana Standard, 3 to 80; Standard Oil of California, 3% to 97; Mobil, 2 to 76%; Union Oil of California, 1% to 51; Atlantic Richfield, 2 to 67%, and Amerada Hess, 2 to 45%.
Louisiana Land, which slid 9% Tuesday, rebounded 2% to 56%; the company said investors may have overreacted to news Tuesday that the second well on its Sheridan prospect in Washington Parish, La., had "disappointing” results.
Among other technology issues. National Semiconductor jumped 3 to 41% in active trading. Honeywell gained 2% to 94%, and Control Data, 3% to 70.

Boeing, the volume leader, climbed 2% to 39%; it rereceived orders for as many as 60 of its 757 jets.
Union Pacific Gains
Union Pacific spurted 3% to 77%: it reported an oil and gas discovery well in the Williston Basin, N.D.
Crouse-Hinds gained 3% to 40%, and Belden rose 3 to 45. InterNorth made a new bid for Crouse-Hinds, including Belden.
Champion International eased % to 25%; a 243,500-share block handled by Salomon Brothers traded at 25. and another of 300,000 mostly handled by Kidder Peabody & Co. moved also at 25.
The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.55 to 340.31 and winners led losers better than three to two. Turnover expanded to 10,780,000 shares from 7.220,000 Tuesday.
Canadian oil stocks on the Amex ran counter to the market trend, with Gulf Canada, the most active stock, dropping 1 to 17% on 1,374,900 shares. A block of 100,000 shares was handled by Jefferies & Co. over the counter at 17%.
Dome Petroleum, in third place, fell 1% to 52%, and Imperial Oil Class A dropped 1% to 27%. But Ranger Oil climbed 1 to 50, after reporting nine-month operating profit of 80 cents a share compared with restated earnings of 33 cents a year earlier.
