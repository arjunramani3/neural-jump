The government rescue of American International Group rattled investors instead of reassuring them, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its worst three-day drop since August 2002.
Fear levels ratcheted up a notch as stock investors looked at credit markets and realized that banks and other lenders were pulling back from lending, even to many of their fellow banks, until they figure out what is safe.
The Dow fell 449.36 points, or 4.1%, to 10609.66, the index's lowest finish since November 2005. Counting Monday's 504-point drop and Tuesday's 142-point rebound, the Dow is down 7.1% in three days. It is deep in a bear market, 25% below its record of 14164.53 hit Oct. 9 2007.
"Institutions don't trust each other to lend to each other. People are concerned about who might be next" after AIG and Lehman Brothers Holdings, said Linda Duessel, market strategist at Pittsburgh money- management firm Federated Investors.
She is telling clients to stay out of the stock market for now. "It would be heroic to jump in. It would be unwise. You need to admit that these are unprecedented times," she said.
The dollar fell, as did stocks in Europe.
Gold, a traditional refuge for anxious investors, posted its biggest percentage gain in nine years, soaring $70.10 a troy ounce, or 9%, to $846.60. Oil futures jumped 6.6% to $97.16 a barrel, the biggest one- day percentage gain since June 6. Treasury-bond prices rose, as investors fled to their relative safety as well.
In all, U.S. stocks lost about $700 billion in market value on Wednesday, and $1.1 trillion for the week's first three days, based on the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index, which includes almost all U.S.- based companies. The one-day decline represented 4.63% of the index's value.
"When we were down 500 on Monday, there didn't seem to be as much panic, but today there was panic. Everybody keeps saying there is another shoe to drop," said Todd
Leone, head of listed stock trading at New York brokerage firm Cowen & Co. "People are afraid to go home long," he said, meaning that traders don't want to hold stocks overnight, for fear they will fall more the next day.
Investors also focused their worries on Wall Street's two remaining major independent brokerage firms, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group. Morgan Stanley fell 24% and Goldman fell almost 14%. Unlike the broad market, which fell heavily at day's end, both of those stocks recovered some ground during the day and finished well above the day's lows, however.
