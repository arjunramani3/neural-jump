until the market itself gives some indication of establishing a trend. In periods of activity either up or down, shorts always are more willing to assume positions. Late on Friday, and again in the early dealings Satx^day, shorts were more active than they have been recently, taking positions in anticipation of at least a minor reaction following the sharp run-up.
Criticism From the A. F. of L.
The monthly survey of the American Federation of Labor criticizes the Administration in no uncertain terms and puts its finger on uncertainties which business men themselves stress. Lack of any HAfinitinn of points in the Administration’s program and lack of uncertainty as to the outlook for profits are the major items which are holding back business, the survey contended.
Leadership in the Market
The enthusiasm for stocks which, made itself felt in a sharp advance in prices on Friday carried over into the early dealing’s In the short session which closed the week, stocks advancing again in relatively heavy dealings. After a quarter of a hour of active trading, however, the market quieted down, but prices held ^mund their highs and the gains generally were maintained. Fractional chants from the previous close were the rule nmnng the leaders, but quite a number of stocks, like Allied Chemical, United States Rubber preferred, and Celanese scored wide advances. Volume in the first hour totaled 410,000 shares and for the full session totaled 703,000 shares, the best Saturday trading since May 12.
Virtual removal of the threat of a steel strike and practical agreement on a substitute measure for the Wagner Labor Bill were two factors which continued to help the market. The Government’s crop report, estimating this year’s wheat crop at 500,000,000 bushels on the basis of the June 1 condition, did not unsettle stocks, because since the estimate was made, grain belt has received a substantial amount of rain, which has altered the outlook somewhat. The crop, on the basis of the June 1 forecast, would be the lowest since 1893.
Strength in bonds continued. Although gains in most cases were not large, the domestic corporation list moved forward in a moderately active market. Government obligations were irregular.
The government’s crop forecast brought a sharp rally in grain prices. Wheat was up around 2 cents a bushel early, but closed up only	Cotton worked up 8 to 10 points, and
other commodities were strong. Strength in rubber futures helped the tire company shares.
Bank of Germany’s Gold Loss Big
The financial community has become quite accustomed to seeing weekly losses in the Bank of Germany’s statement, but last week’s decline to Rm. 211,100,000 from Rm. 130.100,000 is one of the steepest, on a percentage basis, which has taken place, and brings the bank’s gold holdings to a new low point. The holdings on June 7 were less than one-third of the total a year previous, and, while the bank’s foreign currency reserves last week advanced, they are now only about one-ninth as large as a year ago.
In spite of all the steps which have been taken to alleviate conditions, the stringency of Germany’s financial position is steadily growing more acute, and the threat of devaluation of the mark is increasing rather than decreasing. While the level of domestic business is working upward, Germany’s foreign business is continuing to slip off, and it is from her foreign business that she must obtain funds to meet service on her foreign obligations. The boycott and tariffs which Germany now must face in meeting competition put her in an extremely difficult position.
Short Interest Declines
Some decline in the short interest was to have been anticipated from the character of the May markets, but the drop to 741,038 shares from 910, <42 shares at the end of the previous month, or 14 was larger than had been looked for. Dull markets, with minor fluctuations, however, always make the shorts restive, and the tendency is to cover positions and wait
Since the trend of prices was reversed from downward to upward, leadership in the markpt has been in the stocks which for years have been regarded as the pivotal shares. On Friday and Saturday the most active group included such stocks as General Motors, Chrysler, Steel common, Kennecott and New York Central The concentration of trading volume in those stocks and shares of similar calibre is regarded as of considerable significance. In a number of instances these issues have assumed the dominant role in the market in the eraly stages of a move, only to have trading interest switch to less well-known issues in its latter stages
