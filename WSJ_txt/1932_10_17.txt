Stocks dragged through a tedious session at the start of the new week, drifting lower in the late trading, after an apathetic rally, and closing with, leaders off anywhere from fractions to around three points. Bonds were mildly higher in quiet trading. Wheat traveled over a narrow range, and closed unchanged. Cotton wound up at the day's lows, off 15 to 17 points.
Late weakness in wheat at Chicago on Saturday, after the New York exchanges were closed, was reflected in weakness at the start in stocks. Chesapeake & Ohio, Telephone, Steel common and others opened off more than a point under Saturday’s final prices, and losses were general throughout tbe list. Losses were not extended importantly in the early trading, though Telephone slid almost a point under the openingprice of 104% in the first half hour. The list rallied slowly, with the rail stocks leading the way.
Carrier shares gathered strength from the Atchison loadings report, for the week ended October 15, which recorded a gain over the previous week and a narrow decline from the like week of 1931. Atchison, Union Pacific and Central led the rail shares upward, but there was no enthusiastic buying, and the leaders slipped hack dully, after nearing Saturday’s closing levels.
In the last hour. Telephone. Tobacco B, Auburn and Union Pacific weakened, and the market dragged lower, closing near the day’s bottom prices.
Penick & Ford was a spot of outstanding strength, forging ahead In the face of heaviness elsewhere in the list. At its best price, the stock was up more than 3 points. Impetus for the rally came from the company's report for the September quarter, showing profits, before Federal taxes, more than 50% greater than for the like 1931 period. Net income for the first nine months of the year was equal to approximately $1.40 a share on the stock. The company’s operations in the third quarter reflected salary reductions, low prices paid for raw materials and other operating economies. The improvement In business so far in the fourth quarter, over the ifourth quarter of 1931, has been about in line with the third quarter’s showing.
Coal production figures Indicated cheery days for the coal carrying railroads. Bituminous output for the week ended October 8 was up more than 400,000 tons from the previous week and crossed the 7,000,OOO-ton mark for the first time since March. Anthracite output, while under the previous week, was not far below the similar 1931 week.
DuPont’s report for the third quarter was somewhat better than anticipated. Net was put at 36 cents a share on duPont common, of which 23 cents was from the company’s General Motors investment, so duPont’s own operations resulted in net of 13 cents a share, a much better showing than in the second quarter.
New York City bonds staged a brisk rally following the Board of Estimate’s action in approving reductions in the budget.
Markets abroad were irresolute. In London, mining shares were higher in an irregular market. In Paris, stocks ruled lower.
Money Bates and High Grade Stocks
A prolonged period of low money rates, and even the mildest kind of a recovery in business is bound to bring buying eventually in high grade stocks. In some conservative quarters, there been consistent buying in stocks like National Biscuit, Air Reduction and Corn Products during periods of weakness.
Purchases of these stocks have been made on an investment basis, but with an eye to the possibility of competitive bidding eventually coming into these stocks, if low money rates persist and if business next year is only slightly above the 1932 level. National Biscuit, currently selling around 40, Is paying $2.80 a share annually at the present time, with the yield at current levels roughly 7%. Com Products, selling at 50, yields 6% on the present $3 rate, and Air Reduction, at around 56, about 5.4%.
None of the three companies covered their current dividend requirements in the first half. Air Reduction reported net equal to $1.47 a share; Biscuit net of $1.21 a share and Com Products net equal to $1.29. All three companies have benefited from the seasonal pick-up in business, and, for the year as a whole, all three should either cover, or come within shooting distance, of their current dividend payments. Even small reductions in their dividend rates, however, would still leave the stocks yielding a fair return at current prices.
German Foreign Trade
German foreign trade in September showed clearly that rising prices for raw materials, which constitute a large part of the country's imports, had not been offset by a similar rise in finished goods, of which Germany is a major exporter. Until the price levels of raw materials and finished goods are brought in line, Germany's foreign trade figures will suffer, even though actually conditions are Improving within the country, and industrial activity is at a higher rate.
Tbe .export surplus in- September sagged to rm. 84,000,000. It was even about 13% below the August figure and was in sad contrast to the report for September, 1931, when the export surplus reached 387,000,000 marks. Exports for September actually were rm. 16,000,000 ahead of the August total, so Germany really was doing more business abroad. Imports, however, were up rm. 28,000,000 over August. It-is possible that in October, the raw
Spreads •	*
Wall Street’s Interest in wheat, which two weeks ago was concentrated on a rise in the major cereal, now is intent-on following' its decline, With the more optimistic hoping that the effects of the drop Internally will be offset if wheat reaches a basis where it can be exported. It is now closer to an export level, on a competitive basis, than it has been in 23 months, with the spread between Chicago and Liverpool prices for the December delivery at around 7% cents a bushel.
In more normal times, it would take a 12cent spread to develop any export business, but now there is a possibility that shipments may Corne ll the spread reaches 10 cents. The United States, this year, will have available for export, after providing for a safe carryover, somewhere around 300,000,000 bushels of wheat. If it isn't exported, the heavy carryover will serve to depress prices.	j	'
Market Thinness
Traders who came down Monday morning to dispose of stocks found that bids faded swiftly. Even under no very large selling orders, the opening prices for pivotal issues showed sharp recessions from the close at tbe end of last week. On 1,000 shares Ohio common started Saturday's last price. 1,000-share block, was Telephone, on a relatively small transaction, was down lii.
During the period of quiet strength, which succeeded the opening, the market was just as thin on the upside. Telephone jumped % of a point between sales, in dull trading.
The City’s Finances
With the City facing a financial crisis the Board of Estimate showed that it could act if it wanted to and even go so far as to vote for a reduction -in salaries. The bankers having barred another rescue party to save the city's finances and having made it quite obvious none would be undertaken unless the city officials took drastic atepB in the direction of economies, the Board of Estimate saw the light and acted.
Last spring, tbe bankers came to the rescue and saved it for the time being, city, despite a pledge to effect economies, no important. steps in this direction. This the bankers were more wary. They

city's The made time, have achelv^d some action in regard to a cut in city expenses, action that citizens organizations and Individuals have been unable to obtain in months of protest. So far, however, the city’s officials have done nothing to put losing ventures like the subways and the ferries on a self-sustaining basis.
