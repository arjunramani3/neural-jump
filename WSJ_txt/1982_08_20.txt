Abreast of the Market
By Gary Putka
The few cautious investors that appeared to be left on Wall Street after last week’s buying spree are troubled by a single question: If this is for real, why is the economy wheezing?
The answer of the bulls is that the stock market is a mechanism of anticipation. They argue that last week’s 81.24-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial' Average reflected a foresight of better times to come, and that the market has already discounted the present state' of the economy.
But what some seemed to have forgotten by the end of last week’s record advance was that Salomon Brothers’ credit guru, Henry Kaufman, who touched off the rally on Tuesday with his prediction of lower interest rates, based his analysis on the idea that the economy would get worse, throttling the demand for credit.
Steven Einhorn, investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Friday’s 30.72-point surge in the Dow was the most important day of the week. “The market gave a very clear signal on Friday that it was willing to
accept reduced economic activity as the price of lower interest rates," he said.
Investors could have taken Thursday night’s passage of President Reagan’s $98.3 billion tax package as a signal that government demands on the private sector would further delay a recovery. Instead, Mr. Einhorn argues, they preferred to focus on what the revenue measure might do to reduce federal deficit-spending and to lower interest rates.
So long as the outlook continues to favor lower rates, Mr. Einhorn believes, the rally in stocks will continue. His firm last week urged customers, for the first time in a year, to own more stocks than bonds. But until the stock market optimism gets reinforcement from the economy sometime soon, the Goldman analyst believes slumping corporate profits could cut the rally short.
"This isn’t to be looked at as the beginning of a major bull market because it hasn’t been validated yet by economic activity,” he said.
Ron Glantz, chief investment officer at Paine Webber, said bonds look more attractive than stocks, although the firm also believes the gains in equity pnces will continue. Last week, Paine Webber cut its third quarter estimate of real growth in the gross national product to 1% from 2%. and Mr. Glantz is worried that too many companies are still in shaky financial shape. While this makes the environment for stocks risky, “bonds should be good for their coupon yields plus some capital gain" in the next year, he believes, meaning safer returns of 15% to 20%.
Technical analysts at Merrill Lynch believe last week’s price surge was a false start. Richard McCabe, market analyst, said that institutions didn’t reach a state of desperate selling prior to the rally, as they have prior to other long-lasting bull moves.
“We think the market will come back in the fall to test its old lows” in the 777 area, said Mr. McCabe. Other dynamics that aren’t right for a sustained move, he contends. include the fact that customers who don’t buy stocks on credit never became big sellers as the market tumbled prior to last week. This has also preceeded past advances?"

In the short term, however. Mr. McCabe thinks stocks could go higher. Short sales by Merrill Lynch customers are still brisk, he said. A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock, and a bet that the stock will go lower so that the loan will be repaid in cheaper shares. The first signs of danger in the present advance will come when enthusiasm is more or less unanimous, and Mr. McCabe argues that so long as the public is still selling short, that level of overconfidence isn’t near.
Friday’s Market Activity
A Friday afternoon buying spree vaulted the stock market to its biggest week ever in volume and price gains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 30.72"points to 869.29, on volume of 95,890,000 shares. Trading activity was the second highest on record, surpassed only by Wednesday’s 132,690,000 shares.
For the week, the industrial average was up 81.24 points, a record that topped a 73.71-point gain in the week ended Oct. 11, 1974. Total New York Stock Exchange share volume in the five trading sessions last week came to 455,127,820 shares, also • the highest recorded, and up from 251,027,670 shares the week before. Trading volume for the week exceeded the entire amount of shares traded on the Big Board in 1953.
Blue-chip issues held center stage. International Business Machines rose 2’4 to 68%; American Telephone gained 1% to 56% and General Motors moved up 2% to 47%. These and seven other issues traded over one million shares each.
The Dow Jones utility index advanced 9.05 points, or 5.5%, to 115.36. The transportation index climbed 28.55 points, or 9.6%, to 324.04. The gain in the industrial average amounted to 10.3%.
