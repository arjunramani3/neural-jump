XValker A Co., in an analysis of West Indies Sugar, said: “It seems likely that net income under anticipated conditions will amount to about $6 55 a share next year, with the possibility of earnings rising to nearly $8 a share as a result of the escalator clause provisions in the Cuban-U. S. sugar contract.” • • * Delafield A Delafield has reviewed railroad securities. pointing out that “while these equities were fairly high during the war. a setback amounting to as much as 50% in some cases has since taken place.”

Cigarette Companies—
While dollar sales of the “big five” cigarette producers continue to rise. American Tobacco Co., aided by the growth of its popular Pall Mall brand, has been steadily increasing its share of the total volume. A study of the quarterly sales reports of the leading manufacturers shows that Liggett A Myers TobAceo Co., Philip Morris A Co.. Ltd . Inc and P. Lonllard Co. hax-e accounted for a somewhat smaller percentage of the “big five’s” totAl than they did a year ago.

Reynolds, which raised its price only 23 cents per thousand, is expected to make more Camels available to the trade in coming weeks however, and thereby to keep pace with anticipated volume increases for the other major producers Average quarterlysales for the big five last year were $423.-12 963.

est Indies Sugar Corp.—
Prospects for West Indies Sugar Corp, during the next two years appear good A world sugar shortage points to a need for all the sugar the company can produce on its Cuban and Dominican Republic properties in that time. During the past year. West Indies broadened its operations through the acquisition of the Warner sugar propertv in Cuba. Known as Central Miranda, it contributed about 400.000 bags of sugar to West Indies production last season. Larger production and better prices raised West Indies’ earnings for the fiscal year ended September 30. 1946. to 56.18 a common share from 54 06 a share in the preceding year. Sugars were valued conservatively at 3.675 cents a pound. f An undetermined additional amount of Income i is due on 1946 operations under the flexible 1 price provisions of the Cuban-U. S contract, which cox ers both the 1946 crops.
