Higher Taxes Hurt Corporation Earnings
Corporation reports for the first half-year reveal the severe effect of the higher corporation tQ-xe-** on earnings of individual companies. Though earnings are reduced, corporations are forced to pay out more in taxes, cutting down the balance for the securities.
Freeport Texas, for instance, had total income for the first half year of $1,403,615, compared with total income for the like period of 1931 of $1,457,568, a decline of only slightly more than 3$r. Federal taxes for the half year, however, were up to $186,000, against $118,000 for the corresponding half year of 1931, a gain of $68,000, or roughly 57%. The increase in taxes reduced earnings for the capital stock by about 9 cents a share.
Owens-Illinois Glass, with total income about 59G5.000 lower in the 12 months ended June than in the preceding 12 months, had federal taxes of $240,650, an increase of roughly $19,000 over the amount for the preceding 12 months. Total income of General Mills, for the fiscal year ended May 31, was about 3% ahead of total income for the preceding fiscal year, while taxes were about 15% greater in the past fiscal year than for the previous fiscal period.
Stockholders and bondholders, who study reports of companies in which they are interested, may be spurred to make more strenuous efforts to fight against the high cost of government.
Stocks and bonds forged ahead into new high ground yesterday, the share market pushing upward steadily throughout '	‘	’
bonds, domestic issues were uniformly firm, railroad obligations giving the greatest show of strength. Governments closed about unchanged, but foreign issues were generally higher. The principal commodities failed to share in the buoyancy of the securities markets, wheat, corn and cotton all closing lower.
There was news aplenty to account for the further sustained strength in the securities markets. Fisher’s commodity price index moved up another notch. The advance since the week ended July 17 has been the widest, both in actual points and on a percentage basis, since the commodity price level started to tumble back in 1929. A number of earnings reports which 44’ere published over the week-end were better than anticipated, although all but one or two made unfavorable comparisons with the corresponding period of the previous year.
The action of the market itself generated further optimism. During periods of hesitancy, when prices dipped off slightly, activity was sharply curtailed Volume picked up sharply as prices worked higher. The action of the , greater	.

Uo4x Priced Preferred Stocks Moving Upward
Low priced preferred stocks have scored sharp gains from the bottom prices reached on the decline, the advances in some cases amounting to more than 100%. In others, gains on a percentage basis have not been so wide, but have been substantial. Yesterday, a number of low-priced preferred stocks showed unusual strength and activity, furthering their gains.

Address by Borah and Bennett Well Received
From the long-term viewpoint, both the ad- ; dress of Prime Minister Bennett of Canada at ' the Ottawa conference, and Senator Borah’s ! radio address, urging a world economic conference, augured well lor the future The Prime Minister’” speech was a business-like statement setting the tone of the conference, and indicating that Canada was willing to make sub”taji-tial roncess.ons to gain Empire agreement on elimination of tariff barriers
Senator Borah s speech, particularly the section envisaging the probability of debt revision or cancellation, constituted a dramatic ehnnge of front The Idaho Senator’s message may be regarded as the first important break in the ranks of the political leaders who have publicly opposed the idea of debt revision or cancellation It shows how drastically changed economic conditions have forced politicians to shift their ground on financial matters.
Sharp upswings occurred in individual stocks in yesterday'” market, with the rails and the oils, a” groups, showing the greatest buoyancy Among the rails. Union Pacific was the leader, moving up almost 3 points and closing at th? day’s high. After the close, the company ported that net —	"	‘
was equal io $2 06 a share stock, against $3 18 a share in the of 1931.
This year, the company took m sidianes $2,400,000 more than in the of 1931. This was equivalent to a	.
than 51 a share on Union Pacific common stock, so that without these extra payments, net for the first half would have been only about $1.03 a share on the common.
Jn 1931, Union Pacific earned only about 32% of its net income for the year in the first six months. The last half of 1932 may not show so great an increase as did the last half of 1931, but in any event, net for tlie year should be substantially better than many of the pessimistic forecasts made recently. Incidentally, the statement was the first ever made public by the company on first half-year results
