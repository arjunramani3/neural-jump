The selling continued in many of the world's stock markets, driven by a slew of gloomy corporate announcements, poor economic news and growing alarm about the exposure of international banks to risky hedge funds and troubled emerging economies.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index tumbled 5.41 points, or 3.22%, to 162.65; Japan fell 1.6% to a new 12-year low as the Bank of Japan's “tankan" survey showed that business sentiment has worsened in the past three months; some of the major European bourses sank to their lowest levels for 1998 with declines of as much as 8%, as financial stocks were hammered yet again; and Latin American markets crumbled in Wall Street's wake, with Brazil down 9.6% and Mexico down 5%.
The 2.94% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday, followed by a
further 2.68%. slide in the U.S. yesterday, added to the glum mood around the world’s stock markets.
"When there are severe corrections, you tend to find there's a capitulation phase when people throw in the towel and just get out, and we're probably getting into that phase," said Peter Oppenheimer, chief investment strategist with HSBC Securities in London.
"Increasingly people are talking about global recession, and not only are the markets adjusting to [analysts’l downgrades, but we're also getting profits warnings from management, so we’re getting quite indiscriminate falls,” in stock prices, he added.
Dutch financial-services group ING Groep issued a profits warning late yesterday, coming on the heels of a warning front Germany’s Dresdner Bank late on Wednesday, which helped knock European bank stocks lower-at a time when investors are already very concerned about
banks' exposure to hedge funds and emerging markets.
Tuesday's quarter-point cut in U.S. interest rates is simply not enough to outweigh the ferocious effects of these downgrades, Mr. Oppenheimer said. "A tot of people have been very overweight in I European! banks because it was the place to be, so they are cutting their weightings pretty indiscriminately, and dumping everything which could possibly come up with a nasty surprise,” said Mr. Oppenheimer.
Wednesday's decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average helped knock most Asian markets lower yesterday, with the exception of Hong Kong, which was closed for a public holiday'. Singapore's Straits Times Index tumbled 2.5%, Australia’s All Ordinaries Index lost 0.7%, while South Korea’s Composite Stock Price Index closed down 1.5%.
But the most widely watched market in Asia was TOKYO, where the Nikkei 225 index slumped 209.27 points, or 1.6%, to close at 13197.12, hitting a new 12-year low for

the second consecutive session. The Nikkei touched an intraday tow of 13018.75.
Retreating issues overwhelmed advancing issues by 1,020 to 186, while 94 issues were unchanged.
The Japanese market, which has faced a steady stream of profit warnings, creditrating downgrades and corporate failures, yesterday came under pressure when the Bank of Japan's tankan survey was released.
Bank shares fell heavily and in several cases hit new lows for the year. Sakura Bank, the most actively traded issue, fell 10% to 180 yen. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi fell 7.3% to 811 yen, Sumitomo Bank fell 4.9% to 903 yen, and Industrial Bank of Japan tumbled 12% to 440 yen.
Shares in Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost 12% to 505 yen. despite news of a tie-up with J.P. Morgan’s investment-management subsidiary.
Among the brokerage houses, Nomura Securities shares fell 7.7%. to 905 yen as the stock continued to slide in the wake of Moody’s decision to downgrade Nomura’s debt rating on Wednesday.
Blue-chip exporters also sank with Sony down 5.7%, to 8,950 yen. and TDK down 7.2% to 8,630 yen. Among the auto makers, Nissan Motor touched a new year-to-date low of 300, before ending the day down 17% at 315 yen.
As trading resumed in Asia Friday, news that Japanese lawmakers were mov-
ing to submit long-awaited banking-reform legislation to a parliamentary vote failed to spark a recovery in Tokyo stock prices, and the market closed the morning session down 0.3%. South Korea was up 0.4% at midday. In early dealings, Malaysia was down 1.7%, and Singapore had shed 1.4'1.
On Thursday, key stock-market indexes in Europe fell heavily at the outset-with Portugal down as much as 15%, at one stage, forcing a halt to trading in Lisbon— and most European stock markets ended the day with heavy losses. Madrid tumbled 7.1%, Frankfur t dropped 7.6%, Paris shed 5%, and Milan slid 4.7%. Overall, the Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 665 European companies closed down 11.37 points, or 1.8%, at 224.49.
In LISBON, the market suffered its biggest-ever one-day loss in percentage terms as the Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa index plummeted 336.95 points, or 8.6%, to close at 3604.32 in heavy trading.
Shares in Portugal Telecom dropped 8.2%r to 5.725 escudos, while bank stocks took a severe knock: Banco Comercial Por-tugues tumbled 8.2% to close at 4,250 escudos, having been down as much as 25% at one stage; Banco Espirito Santo dropped 12%; and Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor dropped 8.8%.
Elsewhere in Europe, bank stocks continued their slide of recent days. ING yesterday warned that its profits would be significantly lower than it predicted just a few weeks ago, adding that it would cut 1,200 jobs.
ING forecast earnings-per-share for the group would grow 15% for 1998, down from the 30%-to-35% increase projected in August. While Amsterdam's AEX index fell 4.1%to 895.97 points, shares in ING fell 5.-1% to close at 80.30 guilders. But ING's American depositary receipts plunged 11%, in New York immediately after the profit-warning and layoff announcement, before ending at S37.1875, down S6.6875, or 15%.
Among the banks hit hardest yesterday was Dresdner Bank, after its chairman Bernhard Walter said the bank's exposure to emerging markets and hedge-fund Long-Term Capital Management LP will squeeze third-quarter earnings by an unspecified amount. Together with an investment downgrade by J.P. Morgan & Co. to "market underperformer” status from a “market performer" ranking, Mr. Walter’s comments helped push Dresdner’s shares down 8.1'Zr, to 55.15 marks.
Among other German banks, Commerzbank shares shed 10% to end at 40.45 marks, while Deutsche Bank fell 6.3% to 79.61 marks, and in London, financial stocks led the decline, with money-manager Amvescap falling 10% to 303 pence, and Lloyds TSB down 8.6% to 602 pence.
It wasn’t just bank stocks that got hit. German auto stocks fell as the weaker dollar dented export prospects. Volkswagen shares ended down 13% at 101.90 marks, BMW dropped 5.8% to 1,000 marks, and Daimler-Benz lost 8.9% to close at 126.65 marks.
Meanwhile, Latin American markets grew increasingly jittery as U.S. stocks slid yesterday.
In MEXICO CITY, the key IPC index
closed down 5%, or 179.65 points, at 3390.23. Market heavyweight Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) lost 4.1% to23 pesos, while finan-, cial group Bancomer fell 14%.
In BUENOS AIRES, the Merval Index shed 29.34 points, or 7.TO, to 350.94, as energy group YPF dropped 8.7% to 23.G5 pe< sos, and phone company Telecom dropped 7.6% to 5.50 pesos.
