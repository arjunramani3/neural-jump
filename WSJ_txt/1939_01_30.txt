NEW HIGHS AND LOWS— ...	. .
■ Monday, on the New York Stock Exchange,
By Robert Laffan
The breathing spell over the week-end gave stock traders an opportunity to take a calmer view of international affairs. This made itself felt in one of those surprising shifts in supplydemand relationships within a market that has

been rendered thin through SEC regulation and rendered highly sensitive by the war-like background. Prices worked forward slowly but confidently through the morning and then^con-cluded the session with a dash for still higher price levels as shorts rushed to cover.
Hitler's message was practically disregarded, or perhaps the morning rumors that it would prove no menace to world peace were helpful to sentiment. In any event, price improvement seemed to anticipate the speech and the market had closed • strong a good hour or more before conclusion of the message.	'
The week-end presumably provided traders an opportunity to take inventory of the favorable and unfavorable aspects of the current situation. Traders who had not lightened or liquidated holdings previously were of no mind to start doing so just prior to Hitler's pronouncement, particularly after the drastic setback in market values over recent weeks. Then again, the thought developed that perhaps there would be no war. Second view of the domestic business situation brought home the realization that there was no evidence of a serious setback here.
Mid-day market dealings were enlivened temporarily by some selling in utilities as the Supreme Court refused to enjoin the sale bf power by the TV A. But the utilities quickly bobbed back and ended along with industrials and rails in higher ground. The more volatile industrials gained 2 to 5 points on the day.

TV A DEVELOPMENTS—
Utility stocks again demonstrated their fortitude by resisting fairly satisfactorily the disappointing Supreme Court action in connection with the suit brought against the Tennessee Valley Authority's activities. The Court again avoided the problem of deciding upon any of the constitutional questions involved, by simply dismissing the plea of the fourteen litigating utility companies on grounds that , they did not have standing to maintain their suit.
,Thc effect of this ruling is to return utilities to their previous legal position in their attempt to restrict and limit government competition. However, it may hasten settlement of the question of sale of properties or arrangements for resale of TVA power by the companies at agreed rates. Although utility company officials are reticent regarding negotiations between Wendell L. Willkie, president of Commonwealth & Southern Corp, and J. A. Krug, chief engineer for the TVA, it is believed that progress is being made toward a satisfactory compromise regarding the dispute. Of course, it would have helped Commonwealth & Southern's bargaining position had the court ruled the TVA activities unconstitutional, but then there probably would have been further delays and much additional uncertainty before the air finally became cleared. At present, conferences between Mr. Willkie and TVA have been resumed and since it was a TVA official who requested renewal of negotiations, it is possible to look upon a satisfactory compromise as a likely development.

BUSINESS PATTERN— .
Thus far the domestic business situation appears to be following the pattern outlined by one of the electrical equipment companies that does a widely diversified business. That company's calculations, prepared before the recent flurry of nervousness, bears repeating because the nature of the company's business requires that a fairly long’term view be taken.
It was estimated that the first quarter would be "draggy" but that improvement would set in during the second period and that the present business recovery would enter new high ground in the third quarter of the year.
So far as the first part of the prediction is concerned business is conforming to the pattern outlined. The prospect for a “draggy" first quarter wae mentioned at a . time when few economist! or statisticians were Inclined to find any fault with the first period outlook. It does not seem, moreover, from current business indices that there, is any excuse for looking upon the domestic business situation as anything more important than a. mild setback. Steel activity does not appear to be going into any major decline and the slight improvement in American Iron & Steel Institute production estimates in the past two weeks offers reassuring evidence. January always is an uncertain month for retail trade, what with year-end clearances and postholiday apathy on the part of the buying public. A better line on durable and consumers goods industries should be available in another month.

MISCELLANY—
Borne copper brokers report consumers are entering buying orders believing market has seen as much unsettlement as can be expected for a while and that prospect of lower domestic price is fading . . . Late buying in Bethlehem described as "poor" and mainly for frightened shorts who rushed stock up five points as Hitler’s speech proved disappointing (to them); addition of 45,000 tons in unfilled orders in past week adds substantially to Bethlehem's rapidiy mounting unfilled orders . . . Investment counsel firm that turned moderately bearish last November and started buying utilities earlier this month has broadened buying recommendations to industrials . , . Illinois Central's Decembei net income of 81,114,096 against $1,080,316 in the 1937 month is more impressive when it is realized that December, 1937, figure was padded with $1,579,083 of special income that was -not available in 1938.
