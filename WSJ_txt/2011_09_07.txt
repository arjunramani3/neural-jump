[...] did remarks from Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans, who said the central bank should consider "significant amounts of policy accommodation" to help the economy and stubbornly high unemployment, even if that would raise inflation rates above desired levels. "Corporate profits, manufacturing and the consumer have actually been quite good in the face of global risk," said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management, citing a recent run of strong manufacturing and service-sector data in the U.S. and the encouraging reading of German industrial production.

It wasn't a banner day for the global economy, but investors needed just a few glimmers of hope to snap the three-day slide by stocks.
Shares around the world mounted strong rallies, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 275.56 points, or 2.5%, to 11414.86, led by bank stocks.
Financials got a boost late Tuesday, when Bank of America, the nation's largest lender, shuffled its top management. The KBW Bank Index jumped 5.9%, with Bank of America rallying 7% to $7.48.
The Dow finished at the session's highs, while crude oil had its biggest one-day jump in a month. Gold prices and the CBOE Volatility Index, the "fear gauge" known as the VIX, tumbled.
Helping sentiment were headlines from a German court, the Italian senate and the U.S. corporate sector, which stanched the flow of grim economic and political news that had sent the S&P 500 to its worst September start ever. Major U.S. stock indexes are now down less than 2% for the month.
Even so, a cloud still hovers over investors, many of them worried about the prospect of fiscal austerity in the U.S. and Europe amid the threat of recession.
As investors struggle to find their footing, the market has swung wildly, with the Dow making triple-digit point moves in 19 of the 26 trading sessions since Aug. 2. There were just eight similar moves in the 26 previous days.
"We've seen these swings before," said Christian Thwaites, president and chief executive at Sentinel Investments. "The economy's not moving anywhere, and there's really no coordinated policy response." In Europe, Mr. Thwaites added, "it's difficult to see how you break out of this loop of low growth and relatively high unemployment and inflation."
Josh Feinman, global chief economist for DB Advisors, Deutsche Bank's institutional asset-management business, cautioned that the good cheer might not last. "The lesson we've learned over and over in this crisis is that there are good days and bad days. These sorts of things are helpful, but they don't solve the problem," he said.
U.S. stocks got a boost even before the opening bell, after Germany's top court ruled that financial bailouts of Greece and other struggling euro members are legal. German industrial production showed month-on-month gains of 4% in July, well above estimates. The German DAX index rose 4.1%.
In Rome, Italy's senate approved an austerity plan that totals more than 50 billion euros ($70 billion) in fiscal savings and extra tax revenue, removing another overhang for investors. The austerity plan now goes to the lower house of Parliament, where it will be reviewed by the budget commission ahead of a vote.
Despite the good news, investors remain concerned about the ability of European policy makers to approve a second Greek bailout and address long-running concerns about growth and debt.
"It's not really a good time to stick your neck out," said Mikel Keifer, investment strategist at Jurika, Mills & Keifer. "Everyone's scared that any downturn is the start of the next 2008, and nobody wants to go through that again."
In the U.S., corporate shake-ups at Yahoo and Bank of America aided sentiment. So did remarks from Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans, who said the central bank should consider "significant amounts of policy accommodation" to help the economy and stubbornly high unemployment, even if that would raise inflation rates above desired levels.
"Corporate profits, manufacturing and the consumer have actually been quite good in the face of global risk," said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management, citing a recent run of strong manufacturing and service-sector data in the U.S. and the encouraging reading of German industrial production. "With the two biggest developed economies in the world going like this, it's clear that there won't be a recession," Mr. Cote said. "It's just slow growth."
Gold futures slid $55.70 an ounce, or 3%, to settle at $1,814.20. The dollar fell against most of its rivals, including the Swiss franc, euro and yen.
All 30 Dow stocks and all 10 sectors of the S&P 500 finished in positive territory.
Among financial stocks, Bank of America rallied 49 cents, or 7%, to 7.48. After the closing bell Tuesday, the nation's largest bank shuffled its top management.
Morgan Stanley rose 1, or 6.5%, to 16.33, and Citigroup added 1.28, or 4.6%, to 28.98.

Also strong on Wednesday were energy stocks, as oil surged $3.32, or 3.9%, to $89.34 a barrel. Chevron added 3.68, or 3.9%, to 99.29, while Exxon Mobil was up 2.50, or
3.5%, to 73.65.
Yahoo got a lift of 70 cents, or 5.4%, to 13.61 after the company said Carol Bartz had been removed as chief executive. Cisco Systems gained 60 cents, or 3.9%, to 15.88, while Intel gained 54 cents, or 2.8%, to 20.08.
Nvidia surged 1.07, or 8.1%, to 14.25 after the chip maker provided a fiscal 2013 sales outlook that was above forecasts.
