Dotsero Cut-Off Virtually Assured
Approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission of a loan of $3,850,000 from the Reconstruction Finance Corp, to the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. to build the Dotsero cutoff virtually assures comstrurction of this vital railroad link. When the cut-off is completed, it will mean a distinct change in the Western railroad picture, for it will put the Missouri Pacific-Denver Rio Grande WesternWestern Pacific in far stronger position to compete for business against other lines. At the present time, the lines are at a disadvantage, due to the circuitous route of the Denver A Rio Grande Western. The cut-off will eliminate 175 miles of the present rail distance between Denver and Dotsero, Col., and cut down the running time for trains about six or seven hours. The management of the Denver & Rio Grande Western hopes to have the link completed witbin 13 months, if construction can be started right away.
Building of the line will be the second big piece of railroad construction work in the area in the past few years. Last year, the Klamath Falls extension, linking the Great Northern and the Western Pacific, was, opened. The new line has been an important traffic source for both roads.
Cotton Cloth Sales Advance
The cotton cloth sales and production figures for August reflected one of the biggest buying | waves in the history of the industry. They showed how fast such a buying wave can change the complexion of an industry.
Sales for the month of August were the largest since Janunry, 1928. They were larger than monthly sales figures in the boom year of 1929.
Stocks underwent a further sharp reaction yesterday, with the Democratic triumph in Maine precipitating the decline. Bonds were generally lower, although the highest grade public utility issues	‘	‘	‘	‘	'
slightly higher, deal of territory, about 1 cent a changed. Cotton sold off early, regained most of the ground lost, and then dipped, closing down $1.50 a bale.

ponent, a stunning political upset. Big blocks of stock changed hands at the opening of the market with prices off anywhere from a frac- j tion to several points. Through the morning, the market sagged lower, with the tape lagging behind as volume increased steadily. In the early afternon, the market steadied, as new buying came in.
In the closing half hour, the market rallied fairly sharply, but the rally was not sustained to the finish. While stocks regained Borne of their losses, the close was off from the day's best prices. The steel stocks led the way in the late upswing, with interest in them increased by the Dow-Jones estimate that steel operations for the week ended Monday showed a gain of around 3% over the preceding week, which included the Labor Day holiday. Steel operations now are back at better than 15% of capacity, the best level reached since the final week of July. The Increase in operations was the largest week-to-week gain for these two weeks in the past four years.
The routine business news was overshadowed by the political developments. The Maine election demonstrated the Democratic strength in the rural districts, usually strongly Republican. It was in these areas in Maine that the Republican candidates met their most severe setbacks.
Among the items included in the day's developments was an advance in shoe prices by two of the big makers. Retail sales in New York showed a sharp increase in the past week, with the advent of the cool weather. While store executives were cheered by the upturn, they attribute it to the weather almost entirely, and do not feel that the sharp spurt will hold. News of the oil industry was not favorable. Output was increased in the most recent week, and the price of Pennsylvania crude was cuL Business failures continued to decline, sinking to another new low for the year in the first week of September.
Trading in stocks was extremely heavy. In the first two hours, 2,800,000 shares changed hands, the largest trading for the period since October 10, 1930, when transactions from the opening to noon totaled 2,942,700 shares. Transactions for the full session reached 5,100,000 shares, against 4,000,000 Monday. The tape lagged behind the market several times during the day.
OU Situation Less Favorable
Oil production figures for the week ended September 10 recorded an upturn over the previous week, with every producing area in the country, except three, contributing to the advance. While remaining within its allowable figure, the Oklahoma field production was stepped up 11,400 barrels from the preceding week. The East Texas and the Gulf Coast fields showed even larger increases.
Increase in crude oil production at this time is not encouraging. Stability was brought to the oil industry generally by curtailment of output of both crude oil and refined products. Increases in crude output, unless there is a marked pick-up in consumption, which does not seem likely, will bring about lower prices.
Mayor McKee and the 5-Cent Fare
The 5-cent fare still is political material, and Mayor McKee has declared he will continue the fight to preserve it. The really big loser in the fight to keep the 5-cent fare, from a financial standpoint, has been the city. Of course, a higher fare would help the Manhattan Railway, but the subway companies, whose income is governed by their preferentials, would not gain, as both now are earning the preferentials.
A fare increase on the subwpy lines would merely add to the city’s income from its investment in the company operated subway venture. As far as the new Eighth Avenue subway line
were in demand and worked Commodities covered a good Wheat, at one time, was off bushel, but closed about un-
ures was the fact that even with sales up so sharply, unfilled orders at the end of the month were up 113.1%.
I Heavy sales, despite the stepping up of pro-i duction, brought about a drastic decline in stocks. They were off 25.5% during the month, falling to the lowest figure on record since comparable statistics became available.
The heavy buying wave carried through the first week of September. Since then, the market has turned quiet.
Revival of the textile industry begins with purchasing by wholesalers. Whether that revival will continue depends on the extent of retail purchasing.
