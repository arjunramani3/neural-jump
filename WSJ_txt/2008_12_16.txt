Stocks rose sharply, prices of Treasury bonds surged and the dollar tumbled after an aggressive interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
The Fed's decision to set a target range of between 0% and 0.25% for its benchmark federal-funds rate, compared with what had been 1%, essentially fulfilled traders' bestcase hopes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 359.61 points, or 4.2%, at 8924.14, its biggest point and percentage gain in more than three weeks.
All 30 Dow components posted gains, led by J.P. Morgan Chase, which jumped 13%.
Investors had bid up financial stocks and other sectors early in the session on hopes that a weak earnings report from Goldman Sachs Group would represent a step in putting Wall Street's credit woes behind it. Goldman shares rose 14%.
The S&P 500 rose 5.1% to 913.18.
The Fed said in its statement that it plans to keep rates low for some time and is considering additional moves to bolster the financial system.
Although investors grew hopeful that the Fed's efforts will help free up the markets for mortgages and other forms of lending to help the broader U.S. economy, some traders and analysts warned that the U.S. could be in for months more of job losses and other woes as the latest policy moves take hold, and new stock-market lows are still a possibility.
The market has fallen back after several previous bounces that followed good news.
"The magnitude of the Fed's aggressiveness is a reflection of the magnitude of the problem they're trying to solve," said Art Hogan, of Jefferies & Co. "We're celebrating for now, but the reality is that the news lately has been pretty bad. You can get into counterintuitive periods where you celebrate that sort of thing, but they can't last."
The dollar fell nearly 3% on the euro. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against six currencies, sank 2.6%.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slid to 2.873%, the lowest in more than three decades, as its price surged. The yield on the two-year note fell to 0.654%.
