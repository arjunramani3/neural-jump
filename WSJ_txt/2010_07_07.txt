NEW YORK--U.S. stock futures gained after jobless claims declined more than expected, a hopeful sign for the labor market.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 34 points to 10014, Nasdaq Composite futures rose skix points to 1796 and Standard & Poor's 500 stock index futures rose four points to 1063. Prior to the data, Dow futures had been up four points, Nasdaq futures were down one point and S&P 500 futures were flat.
Changes in stock futures don't always accurately predict stock moves after the opening bell.
The Labor Department said initial claims for jobless benefits declined by 21,000 to 454,000 in the week ended July 3. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected claims would fall by 12,000. That last time claims dropped by so much was in mid-April.
Meeting the market's expectations, the European Central Bank announced it would hold interest rates steady. The Bank of England also left key rates unchanged at its monthly meeting. The euro, which was boosted Wednesday after the ECB released details about planned stress tests for 91 European banks, was recently trading at $1.2673, up from $1.2642 late Wednesday in New York.
June chain-store sales were mixed, with half the stores that have reported beating Street estimates and the other half missing. Costco Wholesale rose 1.2% in premarket trading after its June same-store sales rose 4%, against expectations for a rise of 3.7%, and Limited Brands gained 5.6% after its June same-store sales rose 6%, nearly doubling expectations for a rise of 3.2%.
However, teen retailer Wet Seal's June sales dropped 3.6%, below projections, and the company said its sees second-quarter earnings below its prior guidance.
Among other stocks in focus, U.S. lender Wells Fargo rose 0.6% after saying it will cut 3,800 jobs and close a business unit that specialized in subprime and other loans issued through its consumer finance stores.
The International Monetary Fund said late Wednesday that the global economy will continue to recover this year and next, despite the turbulence from Europe and worries about sovereign debt. Turbulence in financial markets has "cast a cloud over the outlook," the IMF said.
In Asia, stocks rose, with the Australian market hitting a fresh seven-day high after a stronger-than-expected June employment report. That in turn lifted the Australian dollar and the euro.
Demand for Treasurys was mixed, with the two-year note flat and the 10-year note down to push yield up to 3.01%. Crude-oil futures rose to nearly $75 a barrel, while gold futures declined.
