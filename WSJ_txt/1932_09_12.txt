Atchison Loadings Off Leas
Atchison's loadings figures, the first to appear covering the Labor Day week period, showed a sharp lessening of the decline from - the corresponding week of 1931. Last -year. Labor Day fell on September 7, so that the September 10 week in both years included Labor Lay.
Loadings for the last week were about 720 cars under the previous week, natural in view of the fact that the latest week Included the holiday. They were off only 20.3% from the like 1931 week, while in the period ended September 3, the road's loadings were down 24.7% from the like 1931 week.
A severe reaction in stocks, the sharpest since the drastic dip on August 12, marked the opening of the new week on the New York Stock Exchange. The decline in prices for equities was accompanied by lower prices for prior obligations, with railroad bond issues, particularly the more speculative liens, suffering drastic recessions. The break in the second-grade rail bond market was due, in part, to the Interstate Commerce Commission's .action on the Nickel Plate refinancing proposal, which came as a stunning surprise.
Commodities were lower. Wheat lost close to 2 cents a bushels, and cotton, at the close, was down around $2 a bale from Saturday’s final price.
There was nothing in the immediate business news to account for the severity of the reaction. Wall Street turned to the political situation for a reason, citing nervousness over the outcome of the elections in Maine as one factor in unsettling the market.
Stocks started out in nervous fashion, with fractional declines the rule. . A few Issues, however, recorded small gains, with some of the steel stocks, like Republic Steel and American Rolling Mill, up slightly. Luring the first half hour, the market was quiet and fairly steady, but selling broke out, and the list moved lower. The chief targets were such leaders as United States Steel, American Telephone, American Can, Allied Chemical, Southern Pacific, New York Central, and Union Pacific.
Volume of trading picked up sharply as the list sank. Stocks steadied in the early afternoon, then dipped again. The close was only slightly above the day’s lows, with the active stocks off anywhere from a fraction to around five points. * The market turned dull on the rallies.
The day's news included the Atchison loadings report for the week ended September 10, showing a much smaller percentage drop from the like 1931 week^th^n have previous weeks from similar periods df the preceding year. For the first time in many years, according to a company official, Cadillac sales in August exceeded those of July. Developments in'the steel industry included a noticeable pick-up in the cast iron pipe business in the last week. Tire prices were advanced from 11% to 15%, and tube prices stepped up
Political news from disquieting. Chanellor Reichstag, but a vote
gency decree of President von Hindenburg was carried before the members left the chamber. Troops are expected to occupy the chamber today if an attempt is made to reassemble the body. Markets abroad were mixed. Stocks in Paris were dull, while the London market was generally firm.	'

I. C. C. Nickel Plate ProjMJsaJ a Shock
The Interstate’Commerce Commission’s action in regard to the refunding of the New York, Chicago & St. Louis 6% notes, due October 1, proved a rude shock, and was reflected immediately in prices for the company’s obligations and in second-grade rail bonds generally. The commission approved an advance from the Reconstruction Finance Corp, of $5,000,000 to pay off a quarter of the $20,000,000 maturity. It stipulated that substantially all the noteholders must agree to extending the remaining 75% of the notes for a period of not less than three years from October 1.
The Nickel Plates notes falling due are an unsecured obligation. As such, they are not entirely comparable to other railroad maturities which have been met this year with the assistance of the Reconstruction. Finance Corp. Holders of the Cotton Belt bonds, for instance, received 50% in cash and 50% in a new bond, but the Cotton Belt issue was a mortgage obligation of the road.
The Commission's suggestion that the noteholders approve an extension of not less than three years for 75% of the notes was regarded, in banking quarters, with some disfavor. The road proposed, under its plan of refinancing, a five-year extension for the notes which were not paid off in cash. Although the Commission merely said that the extension should be not less than three years, the road can hardly ask the noteholders now for a five-year extension, as that would be imposing conditions more stringent than those suggested by the I. C. C.
From the noteholders' viewpoint, of course, a three-year extension is more attractive than one more prolonged. The Commission, in suggesting the minimum of three years, probably had in mind that it bad shaved the cash payment.
According to banking interests close to the company, the Nickel Plate notes are scattered among a large number of small holders, with no very big blocks in the hands of individuals or institutions. This will make putting through the plan recommended by the Commission difficult of achievement. .
Motors Stockholders at New High
The latest General Motors stockholder list, Uke similar lists of other major companies, continues to show that the faith of the individual in the big companies has not been shaken by the period of business depression. At the end of the thirfi quarter of this year, stockholders numbered 364,401. roughly 115,000 more than at the end of the third quarter of 1930.
The big Increase in the number of small holders of General Motors stock over the past year or two has been due, partly, to the drastic decline in price for the stock, which has put it within the range of almost any security buyer. The rise in the number of General Motors security holders,, from 1,927 in the
