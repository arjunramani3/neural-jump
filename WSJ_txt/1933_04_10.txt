The markets took courage from the weekend news and staged a toroad recovery in the first trading session of the new week. The financial community is beginning to recognize the tremendous potentialities in the forthcoming conference in Washington on international trade, tariffs and currencies for changing the entire world outlook. Yesterday, too, the markets had the benefit of generally favoring word on industry, including the United States Steel tonnage report, cheery trade news from various centers, and other items.
nationalism. That policy has disrupted world trade and has .been a prime factor in deepening the depression. The country is the logical leader in the move to change conditions, and bring about some sanity in international trade relations. The value of foreign trade of 24 countries in 1932, the National Industrial Conference Board figures, was only $20,051,000,000 in 1932, against 352,985,000.000. Those figures ought to be enough to make political leaders who are to gather in Washington willing to work toward a change in direction of international policy.	_	.
People who attempt to maintain that the rise In commodity prices in this country is due only to the prospects of inflation are wrong. The possibilities for general recovery which the forthcoming conferences hold are sufficient. In themselves, to bring some upturn in commodities.
Steel Tonnage Figures
The unfilled tonnage report of the U. S. Steel Corp, was a great deal better than anticipated. The small decline reported in a month when business was stagnant, due to the banking holiday, was contrary to all expectations. It reflected a sudden spurt in buying in the last few days of the month, which converted what bid fair to be a drop of around 100,000 tons to one of only 13,198 tons. Orders booked in the final days of the month were unusually heavy*.
The Harriman Bank
A good deal of mystery surrounded the statement that Harriman Bank depositors are to be paid off in full, but with or without mystery the news was welcome. The fact that a member of the New York Clearing House Association as permitted to close, without any assurance at the time that depositors would get out whole-skinned, aroused a good deal of unfavorable comment That the matter is to be cleared up without much delay is a distinct satisfaction.
Stock started off strong, showing some pronounced gains at the opening. They pushed ahead in active trading for the first two hours and then the market turned dull. New buying came in, and in the last half hour the whole list surged forward in an extremely active market, with the tape lagging as much as 2 minutes behind. Trading for the day ran to 1,760,000 shares for the session, the highest since March 16. Gains in active stocks ran to as much as 4 points.
Industrial bonds were the highlights in the domestic corporation list. Railroad obligations were higher, too, and the bond market had a much improved tone, pushing ahead slowly most of the session. Foreign bonds were uniformly firm, and United States Government issues ranged higher.
Grains traveled over a fairly wide range of prices, with a late recovery putting wheat up around the best prices of the move. September wheat sold fractionally above the 60-cent mark again, and at the close the major cereal was up ltol’i cents a bushel. Corn and the lesser grains finished fractionally higher. Cotton closed 3 to 5 points higher.
Prices were higher throughout on the Paris Bourse. In London, the market was steady.
Stocks were active in the early dealings, and gains scored on opening transactions were large in some cases. Union Pacific, for instance, started off with an tidvanc-' of more than 2 points, ana some of the other rails came to life. The early prices, for the rails, were about the best of the day. They were laggards while industrials were pushing ahead. Steels were strong again, bolstered by the upturn in the operating rate of the industry’- Trading volume for the day* ran to around 1,400,000 shares, a sizable gain over the volume which has prevailed in recent session.
Anticipating Sinking Funds
Tempted by low prices, the Texas Corp, last year anticipated sinking funds not only on its own 59© debentures but also on subsidiary company obligations. Under the indenture of the Texas Corp. 5s, 35,000,000 of the issue is to be retired annually’, beginning October 1.	2035.
During 1932, the Texas Corp 5s sold down to 71 v.» and the corporation had a chotce opportunity to anticipate that first sinking fund The company’s annual report does not reveal the cost of the bonds to the company. There must have been a substantial saving in the purchase, however.
Through purchase of $1,200,000 California Petroleum Corp. S’* %s. sinking fund requirements for all 1933 were taken care of, and purchase of $1,400,000 of the California Petroleum 5s provided for sinking funds through May 1, 1935.
Cash Income Double Outgo
While the Texas Corp, reported a net loss of S2.1G1.840 last year, a study’ of the year’s income account shows that actual cash income from operations alone was more than double cash outgo. The company reported a balance irom operations of $35,789,117 last year, and actual cash outgo for interest and dividends was only* roughly $16,900,000. The other items chargeable against current income, which brought about the loss, were book-keeping matters.
One interesting item on the corporation’s balance sheet was the transference out .of current assets loans made in connection with the company’s stock purchase plan for employes. The company pointed out that during 1932 installment payments on employes’ stock purchase contracts had been cut to 25 cents a share, irom $1 a share. This, coupled with “present conditions,” as the company put it, led to the shift, certainly one in the interest of conservatism.
Statistics Favor Wheat
Tbe government’s figures on winter wheat more than bore out estimates carried m The Wall Street Journal for some weeks. The government’s estimate of only roughly 334,000,000 bushels is 21.000,000 bushels lower than the lowest of the private crop forecasters, and a crop of that size would be 128,000.000 bushels under the 1932 winter wheat outturn. The government’s estimate is on the basis of April 1 condition, and it should be held in mmd that since April 1 the weather in the winter wheat belt has been consistently* bad for the growing crop.
According to the government, the amount of wheat on the farms is 178.000.000 bushels. That is higher than last y*ear. when only 166,000,000 bushels were held on the farms at the corresponding date. However, wheat on farms and the prospective crop combined are far short of the 1932 position.
Silvers and Steels
All groups of stocks finally joined in the advance y*esterday, but for a time the silver mining company shares held the spotlight. International Silver common was one of the features. running up 3% points in unusually active trading and closing at the day’s high of 201a. The preferred also moved up briskly* to a new top on the move. Ccrro de Pasco advanced 1% to 11 *£, an appreciation of better than 10%. and U. S. Smelting & Refining added more than 12% to its value, closing at 29 Steel stocks were the favorites m the late trading, led by Steel preferred, Bethlehem common and preferred and Republic. Homestakc. the recent star performer, dropped 7 points, and the other gold diggers sagged.

Company Profits on Stock PurchaacN
Some companies which purchased their own stock when they thought it cheap have had sad experiences during the long depression, facing sizable losses. If the upward trend in equities continues, these companies will have some satisfaction in seeing present losses converted into prospective profits.
A few companies already have profits in their own stock. United States Smelting & Refining at the end of 1932 held 28,128 shares of its own stock, which cost an average of roughly $13.75 a share. Present prices for the stock are just about double the cost, and the rise has afforded the company an opportunity, if it so wishes, to get rid of the stock at a substantial profit.
Leadership for the World
The forthcoming conferences in Washington on international economic matters are of trans-cendant importance to this country and to the world. The very fact that the conferences arc to be held, and that the United States is offering definite leadership in the effort to break down trade barriers, is more encouraging, from the world trade standpoint, than anything that bos happpnod since the Lausanne Accord was signed last July.
Secretary Hull put the whole matter in a nutshell when he said that this country had been one of the leaders in the policy of economic
