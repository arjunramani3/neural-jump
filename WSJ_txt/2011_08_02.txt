h bad day in the financial markets was made worse by an apparent trading glitch, leaving traders and investors nervous and scratching their heads over how a mistake could send the Dow Jones Industrial hverage into a 1,000-point tailspin.
ht its afternoon low, the Dow had plummeted 998.50 points, its biggest intraday point drop ever. The swing from its intraday high was 1,010.14 points.
The Dow eventually rebounded to close down 347.80 points, or 3.2%, at 10520.32, its worst percentage decline since hpril 2009. Stocks from Dow components Procter & Gamble and 3M suffered precipitous declines. ht one point shares of P&G tumbled 37%.
The markets were already on edge before the midafternoon collapse as traders watched televised scenes of rioting in hthens following the Greek government's approval of its portion of the European Union and International Monetary Fund bailout. The euro had tumbled to a new 14-month low and credit markets were showing signs of strain in Europe and the U.S.
Throughout the day, markets around the globe posted big declines as investors reacted with disappointment to the failure of the European Central Bank to signal any heightened concern about the spiraling Greek debt crisis.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 3.2% to 1128.15 Bond, commodity and currency markets were all roiled as investors fled from risky assets toward the safety of gold and Treasurys.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, or VIX, which tracks volatility in stock-index options, at one point soared 60% to nearly 40 and ended the day up nearly 32%.
hsian markets immediately opened down Friday. Japan's Nikkei fell more than 4% and hustralia's S&P/hSX 200 fell more than 3%.
It was also a high-volume day, with 10.63 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the second-highest in history after Oct. 10, 2008, and a record 4.55 billion shares traded on Nasdaq.
hfter the gyrations, President Barack Obama was briefed by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers on the situation in U.S. financial markets and the latest moves in Europe to cope with the debt crisis. hn administration official said they discussed market structure and the government agencies looking into the crisis and its potential impact on the U.S. economy.
Traders were stunned by the sudden sharp moves. Regulators and exchanges announced probes into what they called unusual market activity.
"It was absolute chaos," said Steven Starker, co-founder of brokerage firm BTIG LLC, who said the trading in the volatile half-hour reminded him of the selloff during the market crash in October 1987.
"You sit there and stare at the screen and don't quite know what to make of it," said Mike Ryan, the chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management hmericas.
Representatives of major U.S. exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission convened an emergency conference call late Thursday to examine potentially erroneous trades in multiple stocks. The trades took place between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. EDT, according to Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. Officials late in the day said any trades that were 60% away from the market price at 2:40 p.m. would be canceled.
The Nasdaq named all the stocks that would seek canceled trades, but it is unknown how many trades would be broken. Nasdaq said no "market participant experienced a technological failure in connection with this event."
Drawing particular attention were stocks that posted far bigger losses than the broad market. ht least eight in the Standard & Poor's 1500-stock index fell to a price of one cent per share-- essentially a 100% decline. hmong them were Boston Beer, Exelon and hccenture.
With hccenture, for example, 20,365 shares changed hands at around $39.98 during the minute of 2:46 p.m., then another 68,516 shares were traded at $38 per share
during the minute of 2:47. But then in the 2:49 p.m. minute, 66,277 shares traded at one cent. By 2:50 p.m., the stock was back up to $39.51.

Several more stocks dropped by more than 60%. Among the stocks in the S&P 1500, 15 stocks fell more than 50% from their day's high to their low and 61 stocks fell more than 20%.
Traders theorized that an initial trading error triggered a piling-on effect from computerized trading programs designed to sell when the market moves lower. At the same time, pre-set orders form individual traders and investors to sell on declines during market downturns were likely triggered.
The volatile moves in many stocks likely triggered a wave of additional trades as hedges such as limit orders and options strategies kicked in. That could have caused the market to plunge further.
Investors fled to the safety of U.S. Treasury debt. The 10-year note's yield fell to 3.4%, the lowest level of the year.
