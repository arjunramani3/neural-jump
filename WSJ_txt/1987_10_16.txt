An Appraisal: Enormous Volume Could Be a Good Sign, Some Say
ABREAST OF THE MARKET
Bv John R. Dorfman
The record trading volume that accompanied Friday's downslide in stock prices was viewed as a good sign by some technical stock market analysts. They call Friday's session a classic “selling climax.” a sign that the recent selling frenzy has exhausted itself. Others, however, aren't convinced that the market's fury is spent.
As the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a record 108.35 points, volume swelled to an unprecedented 338.5 million shares. It was the third major decline in as many days. But several technical analysts said that the big volume accompanying Friday’s session might mean better things ahead.
Dennis Jarrett, a technical analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co., said the market has reached a “capitulation point.” At that point, he said, “The heat gets so strong that people can't stand by the fire any more. They all throw in the towel at the same time." That means, in Mr. Jarrett's opinion, that “if we haven't seen the bottom. we’re probably very close.”
Big market declines always end in “a final death rattle” during which it seems “like the world is coming to an end," said Jack Solomon, a technical analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. Friday’s session, he said represents that sort of "climactic selling.”
"If you want a wall of worry, this one has barbed wire” on it, Mr. Solomon said. He thinks the high volume and astonishing 17-to-l ratio of declining stocks to advancing ones in Friday's session mean that “the peak of intensity of selling pressure has exhausted itself."
Mr. Solomon, however, believes stock prices won't bounce back right away. "Spike bottoms haven’t been frequent in recent years,” he said. Instead, he said, stocks typically retest their lows on quieter volume after a selling climax, and then begin to rise.
“Everything was on a collision course against buying," Mr. Solomon declared. Among the items that spooked investors, he said, were rising tensions with Iran, continued fear of higher interest rates and worry about the U.S. trade deficit.
Some negative technical factors also affected the market, he said. Options on many individual stocks and some stock-index options expired Friday. That meant that individuals who were hedging their stock holdings through the use of options were about to be left without protection. Some of them therefore sold their stock holdings, erasing both positions.
Some technically oriented traders were concerned, Mr. Solomon said, because the Dow Jones Industrial Average Thursday dropped below its average level for the previous 200 days. Some were also worried by Thursday's bearish signal when the Dow Jones Transportation Average declined along with the industrial average.
More pessimistic was Ned Davis, the head of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Venice, Fla. Mr. Davis says he isn’t convinced that Friday's session was a selling climax. An example of a true selling climax, he said, was Oct. 29, 1929. Volume that day, at 16.4 million shares, was about four times the volume Sept. 3, 1929, the day the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its precrash peak.

Similarly, Mr. Davis says, volume in the selling climax of May 29, 1962, was about 4.5 times the volume achieved earlier that year when the market was at its highs. Thus, he figures that under present conditions a "true panic" would be a day in which 600 million or 700 million shares were traded.
“If (Friday! were the selling climax, which I doubt, I still wouldn’t buy" stocks now, Mr. Davis adds. He says that, historically, stock prices typically sink further in the aftermath of a selling frenzy. So he says “it doesn’t pay to bottom-fish" now.
The peak in volume, in either a declining or a rising market, typically comes a few months before prices reverse their trend, Mr. Davis said. For example, in the recent roaring bull market, volume peaked in January, he said, but prices peaked in August. Thus, even if Friday's trading does prove to be a volume peak, he figures it will be a few months before stock prices resume a strong trend upward.
What would make Mr. Davis think prices were near a rebound point? He said that after a “waterfall” type decline, there usually comes a day when prices stage a major advance with a strong advance-decline ratio. That doesn’t mean that a decline is over, he said, but is a sign that downward momentum has been broken and a "healing process" has begun.
Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, also was gloomy, if a bit less so than Mr. Davis. The big blow-off Friday may give rise to “a temporary respite,” he said, but he believes the trend is still downward.
“It's frantic selling, and we’re at a pretty good nail-biting stage here, but I don’t think we’ve seen the kind of bloodletting that would be necessary for a major turn,” Mr. Peroni said.
“There’s still too much complacency,” he asserted, both among individual and institutional investors. "We're seeing too many investors holding on to their positions in the hope of a remedial recovery.”
Even people who were expecting a correction were surprised by its size and speed, Mr. Peroni said. "Many were in . awe of the correction when it came this abruptly and monumentally, and were frozen at the switch," he said.
