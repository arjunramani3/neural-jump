THE MARKET.
“	~ .aons were again a little over i.uuv,uuu
<+ . Tliile the declines were uniformly large. The A :tvheavy selling came from Chicago and rumors ’‘difficulties at Chicago exerted an influence all g^day. . During the afternoon traders made low prices ;S7by.compelling the execution of stop orders. There ^was«a good deal of.liquidating out of loans and of ■j+selling by people who preferred a moderale loss 10 iipthe risk of seeing extreme low prices again. Uncer-+;tainty about London had some effect. Generally, t+it was felt that if the Loudon situation to-day ^proved reasonably sound, there would be recovery 4)"in prices.	-
* "I ", lt»< 9	'	, ,
Rumors of trouble at Chicago were regarded as V'»ot likely to have foundation.
St. Paul has fallen 13 points in two days, whii-li : -ought to bring a Tecovery, no matter what the main '■ movement may be.
H - ’A firm which has the credit of doing a good . C'deal of Standard Oil business was a fairly large g,:seller of the Steel stocks.
Et was noticeable that the market grew active --"on declines but became dull on rallies, completely v reversing its recent attitude.
1 Western Union was very fairly supported and insiders claimed that there were plenty of friends for the stock at ruling figures.
’ .'lost brokers called it a Gates market in which heavy selling by All-. Gates led to other selling, and still later 10 raiding for stop orders.	’
The market generally was weak in the absence , ■ of any aggressive buying force, and commission houses, where trading, were selling stocks all day. ' The comparative scarcity of lloek Island in the loan crowd was taken as an indication that Hie Chicago interest controlling lhe road had not let go its holdings.
h The official denial of any change of control in T'"+X Hudson, and its confirmation at the :	insert sea Hering sales of the stock
•	't the day.	/
■	■ vas hold on the idea that if lhe Kuhn. rest has Northern l’acitie. Hili plans in
be modified. Hill people do not attach

■	• lhe Guggenheim merger.

Trade interests, however. Uish on Hie earnings and the outlook for nier tind fall.

’■i ssoui-i I’aeitle, broke badly in spite of reports ' ing by Gould inim-osis and (tie pool. The ■ was scattering but traders thought that lohlers had tin-own slock over bought on lhe - iisj.v disiributod "inside tips.
. s one <>f the after i-onseqnences of the break .1 -es. h is pointed mil that people <-ontrolling H-ial vom-ei ns have been obliged to face big . tind that this in,-iy tell a.g.-iinsl proposed ex-hi in soon- imporiant quarters.
lie Northern I’lU-itic eo’-ncr appears to have d more d inger in London than here. The I.on-H-ai-iiee of selling pi Alleges near the imirket onsiderable time has been severely disturbed cent developments in American slocks. \nmlgtimuted Copm-i- has fallen 12 points in days. ,,.Insiders were repurteil buyers cjuring af 1 ei-nnoii. People who have had good iiifor-:t.mi on Copper said they had sold on the rally should lake buck their stock before long. If was generally understood that the unload-■ of Air. Gates' long stock preparatory to his ' ■ ai-tm-e for Europe started (he afiernoon decline e the-nmi-keL....,St. Paul, Union Paeitie and the el stocks W’ere the most directly alleeled. Iiondon did not trade in more than 7,000 shares >,•1 these were principal^’ sales of Southern l’a-e. There was a merely nominal market on the 1 ler side and Arbitrage houses at. 10.30 had nearly . - received instructions lo reduce (licit' cables.
There was a lit lie bullish talk current on Southern Pacific and sales of this slock lor London were well taken. It was said that a concession to the minority stockholders was on the cards and'w’buld strengthen the hands of the controlling interests in Union Pacific.
, Tlie pool in Continental Tobacco was believed to be a moderate buyer and was still hopeful of carrying the price higher. It was said that the company was beginning to reap the benefit from its heavy expenditures on advertising and its earn ing prospects for the future’ were very hopeful.
Continenliil Tobacco was one of the strongest stocks in the room. II is very clear that some important reasons exists for this strength, which wa.-shown in the panic and again now. People who ought to -be well informed advised friends yesterday, when the market was weak’, Io buy Continental Tobacco for substantial profits.
Tlie demand for slocks in the loan crowd was very limited. Rock Island was scarce at 2 to 3;f and Northern Pacific preferred in sliong demand Hat. The common was not mentioned. Rates on mils were mostly -1 to 5,7, with perhaps the greater part of the business done al the former rale. AVlrn't fe\v industrials were done, loaned at 57.
The corner in Northern Pacific has made some anxiety in regard to trading in Union l’acific. People who thought tie- stock a sale yesterday would not sell through fear of another squeeze. It 1ms been stated verv positivel.v b.v the great interest in Union Parilir tlml there will be no eoruer in t.lmt stock, which means lliat stock will be loaned if required.
The death of Commissioner Goddard of the Trunk Line Assm iaiion aron<ed general expiessions of regret. It was remembered thill he. together with the late Air. Bl.im-hai-d. and Mr. Walker of Atchison. Hid a great deal to maintain peace when cominunit.v of ownet ship was no force in railroad politics. .All died eomparativoly young, and apparently from sheer overwork.
The hard coalers suffered considerably under pressure from traders oncom-aged b.v the heavy liquidation elsewhere and si op orders in Elies. Ontario and Rending issues were caught in considerable volume. The selling appeared to .be.scattering.realizing and so far as could be traced no big interest hail sold the stock’. There was indeed moderate support forthcoming from good quarters but no very jmirked buying puwei.
The rclntivo strength of boiid? in the face of lie&vy. realizing on stocks was a noticeable feature.. ■	’	. i

Union l’aeific convertible -is broke 54 points on heavy realizing, and Wabash debenture B and such speculative issues as Mexican Central income bonds lost ground but with these exceptions prices h'eld well. None of the second class issues lost' more than a point, and Government bonds ami gilt-edged railroad bonds were lirni and practically unchanged. ’Tot’a^ sales'.52,874,000. . .	. .	.
