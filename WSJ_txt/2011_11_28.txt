"The consumer confidence report combined with the sales numbers on Black Friday show we're not going off the deep end in terms of the economy," said Maury Fertig, chief investment officer at Relative Value Partners.

Blue-chip stocks notched a second straight day of gains as a surge in consumer confidence buoyed investor sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 32.62 points, or 0.3%, to 11555.63, on Tuesday. The advance came a day after the blue-chip index rallied 291 points. Home Depot led the blue-chip index higher, jumping $1.95, or 5.3%, to $38.96, a four-year high. Coca-Cola added 1.49, or 2.3%, to 66.19.
Bank of America weighed on the downside, dropping 17 cents, or 3.2%, to 5.08, its lowest level since March 2009. The stock fell further in after-hours trading after Standard & Poor's cut the bank's credit rating. The ratings firm also downgraded dozens of other large financial institutions, including Barclays and Citigroup.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 2.64 points, or 0.2%, to 1195.19. Energy and utility stocks paced the gains, while the technology and financial sectors fell.
The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite declined 11.83 points, or 0.5%, to 2515.51, its eighth drop in the last nine sessions.
The market initially got a boost after a report showed consumer confidence jumped to its highest level since July.
"The consumer confidence report combined with the sales numbers on Black Friday show we're not going off the deep end in terms of the economy," said Maury Fertig, chief investment officer at Relative Value Partners.
Treasury prices fell, with the yield on the 10-year note rising to 1.995%. Crude oil gained for the third consecutive session, rising $1.58, or 1.6%, to $99.79 a barrel. The dollar gained slightly against the euro and fell modestly against the yen.
On the corporate front, AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The process will allow the carrier to continue normal business operations as it restructures its debt. American Airlines was the only major carrier not to turn a profit last year and appeared set for another full-year loss in 2011. AMR plunged 1.36, or 84%, to 26 cents.
Tiffany slumped 6.40, or 8.7%, to 67.22. Its better-than-expected third-quarter results were overshadowed by the high-end jewelry retailer's disappointing earnings outlook for this quarter.
Transocean shed 4.31, or 9.4%, to 41.63. The oil-services company said it was offering 26 million shares of common stock for sale to the public.
Seagate Technology gained 59 cents, or 3.7%, to 16.58, after the hard-disk drive company provided an upbeat revenue outlook for this quarter. The company also issued a fiscal third-quarter estimate that was above Wall Street forecasts. Seagate avoided some of this year's damaging floods in Thailand, which have swamped its competitors and squeezed the overall supply of data-storage drives.
Corning cut its fourth-quarter profit and volume growth estimates. A major South Korean customer informed the company it doesn't plan to honor its contract for the rest of the quarter. Shares slid 1.59, or 11%, to 13.19.
Managed-care company UnitedHealth Group is targeting long-term earnings growth in a double-digit-percentage range, as it aims to expand its Optum health-care-services business. Shares rose 85 cents, or 1.9%, to 45.88.
