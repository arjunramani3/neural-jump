Abreast of the Market
By Victor J. Hn.r.mv
Disappointment over the Federal Reserve's failure to cut the discount rate again sent the stock market reeling yesterday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 36.33 points its second biggest loss on record. Volume of nearly 84 million shares was heavy, but well below recent near-record levels.
There had been widespread expectation last week that the Fed late Friday would cut the discount rate it charges on loans to member banks below the current 9%% level. The Fed lowered the rate from 10% on Oct. 12. But the Fed failed to act again, which some analysts viewed as dissuading other banks from following Chemical Bank’s move Friday in reducing the prime rate to 11%% from 12%.
The industrial average closed at 995.13. Its huge loss yesterday was exceeded only by the 38.33 point drop on Oct. 28, 1929 that triggered the great market crash. Last Thursday, the index had reached a 9%-year closing high of 1036.98, up 260.06 points, or 33.47%, from its 1982 low in early August.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average yesterday finished at 421.84, down 17.53, for its biggest setback since the average was revised Jan. 2, 1970. The utility indicator also fell yesterday.
Underscoring the broad sweep of the decline were the nearly 1,600 New York Stock Exchange issues that lost ground, eight times the gainers.
Technology, oil and blue-chip issues were among the hardest hit yesterday.
“The market had been looking for a reason to consolidate, and apparently found It when the expected reduction in the discount rate didn’t happen,”
commented Michael T. Murray, vice president of Loomis Sayles Inc., Chicago.
He added: “We think the fundamentals that supported the bull market thesis haven’t changed. So, perhaps this interruption will be welcomed by investors who want to increase their market exposure.” The institutions were saying “let’s take our profits and run with them," asserted James C. Andrews, vice president of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott, Philadelphia. “Before the start (yesterday) we had orders to sell 17 blocks each in excess of 30,000 shares. There also was a steady stream of smaller orders from the insitutions during the day.”
Many of the technology issues that sustained big losses yesterday “had been run up sharply last week by short covering,” said Eldon A. Grimm, senior vice president at Birr Wilson & Co.
“So far, the most widely forecast economic recovery of the post-World War II period has proved to be a delusive hope,” contended Robert H. Parks, economic research director at Moore & Schley Cameron & Co. “No economic recovery is yet in sight.” He looks for “a major, if not a violent, correction in the stock market.”
Big Board volume fell to 83,720,000 shares from 101,120,000 Friday. A slower institutional pace was reflected in the drop in trades of at least 10,000 shares to 1,216 from 1,559 the previous session.
Oils Active
Oil stocks were prominent on the active list. Exxon topped the actives on turnover of more than 1.3 million shares and slipped 1% to 29%; the company yesterday reported a slight drop in third-quarter net.
Mobil fell 1% to 28%; Standard Oil of California, 2% to 32%; Amerada Hess, 1 to 28%, and Phillips, 2% to 31%.
Big losers in the technology sector included Digital Equipment, down 4% to 92%; Texas Instruments, 4% to 113%; Honeywell, 3 to 87%; Motorola, 3% to 81%; Sperry, 2 to 26%, and Prime Computer, 3% to 30%.
Also in the loss column, Chicago Milwaukee skidded 4% to 58%; a group boosted its stake in the company to 39.23% of the common. Nabisco slipped 3 to 37%; it reported third' quarter net of S1.25 a share, compared with $1.12 in the 1981 period. Federal Express fell 2% to 59%; a one-milllon-share offering of the common stock was made.
Lockheed, which was strong last week, backtracked 3% to 78%.
Blue Chips Retreat
Among the blue chips. Eastman Kodak slid 3% to 88%; Procter & Gamble, 4 to 110%; International Business Machines, 2% to 80; General Motors, 2% to 51%; Merck, 2 to 80%; Sears Roebuck, 1% to 26, and American Telephone, 1% to 59.
Pennwalt climbed 2% to 33%; a Denver investor has purchased about 10% of the company’s common.
A 225,000-share block of Exxon was handled by Salomon Brothers at 29%. Public Service Co. of Colorado slipped % to 15%; a 320,100-share block handled by Shear-son/American Express moved at 15%.
The American Stock Exchange index dropped 10.18 to 316.42 for its biggest loss since it declined 10.63 last January 11. Losers outpaced winners 553 to 150. Turnover slowed to 6,810,000 shares from 8,330,000 Friday.
Among Amex losers. Forest Labs slipped 2% to 25%; it reported net for the second quarter ended Sept. 30 of 20 cents a share, compared with operating profit of seven cents a share in the year-earlier period.
Wang Labs Class B, which had been up sharply recently, dropped 4% to 46%.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index wasn’t available because of technical difficulties. Losers swamped the gainers 1,201 to 253. Turnover slowed to 45,452,000 shares from 55,635,700 Friday.
