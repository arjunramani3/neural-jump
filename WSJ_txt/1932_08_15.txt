A broad recovery movement in-the final hour of trading; carried prices for active stocks from a fraction to 7 points higher yesterday. Bonds. Jed by the second-grade rail issues, pushed ahead in the closing part of the session, with the Dow-Jones bond average reaching new high ground on the recovery. Government bonds were »r-regular Wheat closed up about a cent a bushel, and cotton jumped nearly $1 a bale. The strength shown tn commodities was an important factor*in the rejuvenation of the securities markets.	.
Stock® started the new week irregular, but changes at the opening were generally small. During the first hour, the rails firmed up. under the leadership of New York Central and Chesapeake & Ohio Tne rest of the list hardened, but there was little important progress on the upside until early afternoon. .In the last hour, stocks forged ahead on increasing volume, with big blocks appearing on the tape Volume of trading in the fir®t two hours was only 700.000 shares, against 2.SOO,000 shares in the two-hour session Saturday. In the last 50 minutes, however. irmaclion.s totaled 600.000 shares and voi-

Cotton Shies Figures Record Betterment *
The July cotton sales figures, with sales exceeding output by 57.1%. reflect curtailment of output as well as increased demand for goods. The figures show that the industry has made striking strides in adjusting output to demand. Stocks were cut down 7.R% during the month, and unfilled orders at the end of July were up 33.4%.
If the first half of the month is any criterion. the August report should be even more favorable than the July figures. Since August 1. the domestic mill situation has shown a major improvement. Demand for cotton cloth has increased markedly, and while mill operations have been stepped up. the demand for goods has far outrun the increase, in the operating rate.

Watch Commodity, Securities Movement® for 1921 Parallel

Prices of stock® moved upward ahead of anv visible change in the business trend which actuallv Marted around mid-year but was not discernible until the fall months.
The bond market first gave sign® <»f a change in trend in early June nt this year A brief rally occurred in the first week of the month, and the Dow-Jone® average of IO corporation is®ue®, ®o far ha® not gone holow the bottom set Tune 1 Commodity price®, a® measured by Fisher’s index. .®et their low sp Jar on June 17, and sjnee have moved up ao<>ut 2’3 point®

Loadings over the Atchison. Topeka & Santa Fe for thf| week ended August 13 were ahead of the preceding week, in line with the seasonal tiend, andthe decline from the corresponding 1931 week was smaller than in previous weeks. Loadings for the August 13 period were off only 22.4% from the 1931 week, against 24.1% for the week ended August 6.
The upturn for the Atchison, while only seasonal, gives encouxagement that loadings for the country as a whole for the same week will i ecord a gain over the preceding week. In 1931, loadings for the week ended August 18 were about 10.000 cars above those for the week ended August 6, and the trend for the remainder of the month was upward.
