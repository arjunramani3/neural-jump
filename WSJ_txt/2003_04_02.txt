Even so, the betting clearly is turning, with investors beginning to believe that stocks will out-gain alternative investments. Treasury bonds and gold, which had soared late in March as investors fled to refuge investments, fell sharply amid the stock buying. Some big institutions, such as insurance companies and pension funds, which hold large amounts of both stocks and bonds, were said to be shifting some money out of bonds and into stocks in a wager that stocks will do better than bonds now.
Short sellers, investors who bet that stocks will decline, covered some of their bets, which also reinforced the stock gains. To bet against stocks, short sellers borrow stock from brokerage firms and sell it in hopes that it will decline, which would permit them to buy it cheaper later. But when stocks begin to rebound, short sellers often close out their positions -- buying back the stocks they had sold and reinforcing the rally.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 1.22%, or 1.19 points, to 98.57.

NEWS THAT AMERICAN forces had scored some of their biggest successes of the Iraq war reignited hopes of a speedy victory, sending stocks soaring.
Eager to avoid being left behind if the war news continues to be good, investors rushed out of gold and Treasury bonds and plowed into stocks -- especially the more speculative technology names.
In a day that reminded investors of the patriotic surges recorded early in the fighting, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 215.20 points, or 2.67%, to 8285.06, its highest level since March 21.
Most of the gains came at the start of trading, in reaction to overnight news that two Iraqi divisions had been defeated and that captured 19-year-old U.S. Army Pfc. Jessica Lynch had been rescued in a daring mission. For the year, the industrials now are down only 0.7%. As recently as March 11, they were down 9.8% on the year.
"Instead of being bogged down, we have advanced to within 19 miles of Baghdad, we have decimated two of the Republican Guard divisions and obviously done some damage to others," said Alfred Kugel, senior investment strategist at Chicago money-management firm Stein Roe Investment Counsel. "I believe stocks will go up substantially if we can pull this off relatively soon -- meaning in a matter of weeks and not months."
Just a week ago, hopes for a speedy end to the war had seemed foolish at best, and fears were spreading that the economy was facing a prolonged funk as business leaders and consumers alike delayed spending decisions until they could see signs of a successful outcome. Now the optimism is back, and with it comes hope of an uptick in business investment, which would help boost the value of beaten-down makers of communications gear, computer chips, computers and other machinery.
Reflecting those hopes, the Nasdaq Composite Index, laden with big tech companies, jumped 3.59%, or 48.42 points, to 1396.72, its highest level since March 21. It now is up 4.6% so far this year, reflecting the relative strength of the big tech stocks.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also is showing a gain, albeit a slim one, for the year so far. After spending most of the year in negative territory, the S&P 500 now is up 0.12%, following yesterday's gain of 2.61%, or 22.42 points, to 880.90.
Despite the upbeat mood, the day's gains weren't quite as strong as they had been during the early buying in March, as the war was beginning, and the market mood wasn't as euphoric. Some market participants worried that tough fighting and plenty of uncertainty remain ahead.
Even so, the betting clearly is turning, with investors beginning to believe that stocks will out-gain alternative investments. Treasury bonds and gold, which had soared late in March as investors fled to refuge investments, fell sharply amid the stock buying. Some big institutions, such as insurance companies and pension funds, which hold large amounts of both stocks and bonds, were said to be shifting some money out of bonds and into stocks in a wager that stocks will do better than bonds now.
Oil prices fell back below $29 amid subsiding fears of war-related supply disruptions. The beleaguered dollar recovered some of its lost ground.
Short sellers, investors who bet that stocks will decline, covered some of their bets, which also reinforced the stock gains. To bet against stocks, short sellers borrow stock from brokerage firms and sell it in hopes that it will decline, which would permit them to buy it cheaper later. But when stocks begin to rebound, short sellers often close out their positions -- buying back the stocks they had sold and reinforcing the rally.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 1.22%, or 1.19 points, to 98.57.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.58 billion shares traded, 2,392 stocks rose and 878 fell.
Bonds declined. The 10-year Treasury note fell 25/32, or $7.8125 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to 3.923%. The 30-year bond was
down 1 11/32 to yield 4.920%.

The dollar strengthened. Late in New York, it traded at 118.86 yen, up from 118.23, while the euro fell against the dollar to $1.0761 from $1.0891.
