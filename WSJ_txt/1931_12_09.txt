Abreast of the Market
By Hichard E. Edmondson
used in the Dow-Jones averages broke through previous resistance levels for the 1929-1931 major decline in yesterday's session. After putting up a stubborn fight above the October 5 low of 86.48 over tbe last tWo weeks, the principal stocks of this group dropped to 84.14, the lowest final level since January 10. 1922. when the compilation stood at 78.59.
With pivotal Industrials succumbing to pressure, declining tendencies spread throughout the list, and the general market extended its progress into new low territory for the primary downward movement, with utilities below the previous support point of 34.88. established October 5, closing yesterday at 34.73.
Further substantial selling came into the carrier group during the morning on announcement that no action had been taken on the quarterly dividend heretofore declared at this time by New York Central. Directors decided to change the dividend disbursements to a semiannual basis, and no consideration will be given to further payments until next May.
New York Central broke to the lowest price on record, and Union Pacific reached a new low since 1903. Extensive declines also took place in Atchison, Baltimore & Ohio. Southern Pacific, and other representative issues of the carrier division.
While rails were declining steadily, Steel common also was in large supply on the additional slump in steel production during the past week. After Steel had reached a naw low for the year, general weakening of other pivotal industrials took place, and previous resistance levels were penetrated by American Can. Westinghouse Electric and du Font.
Grains Under Pressure
Selling broadened during the middle of the day, after the Administration's revenue program had been jointly presented to Congress by President Hoover and Secretary Mellon. Recommendations of special taxes caused increased pressure to be exerted against tobacco, motor, amusement and communications stocks and other shares affected by the proposed new schedules.
General declines also took place throughout the bond list, and grain prices experienced substantial losses. Recessions in corn exceeded a cent a bushel, while wheat quotations were lowered more than two cents.
Tax Proposals An Expected
Administration tax proposals are substantially as had been expected. Their chief feature is a broadening of the tax base by lowering of income tax exemptions, restoration of a tax on automobiles, admissions and a selective list of quasi luxuries, together with a levy on bank checks and on telegraph, telephone and radio messages.
More money is sought by increase of rates, beginning with a minimum of 2% in the normal tax and extending to 40 % on income in excess of $500,000. by.an increase of 1 cent in the stock transfer tax; also by an increase of first class postage to 3 cents.
N’o specific suggestion is made for the abolition of income tax on realized profit in speculation with its corresponding deduction for losses. But the President urges a study ef the economic effect of the narrower tax known technically as “capital gains tax” on assets held for more than two years. In general, it is sought to return tc the 1924 schedules, including a levy of 12* = % on corporations, against 12% at present. ~ '
Steel Prospects Beclouded
Weekly reviews of the steel industry did not serve to clearup the confused sentiment regarding tbe trade outlook. Irregular price tendencies in steel products, and a decline in operations to 26H% of capacity, compared with an average rate of 30% for November, reflected, to a large extent, the usual slowing down at the year-end, prior to holiday shutdowns.
Steel producers are preparing to Institute advances on some products for the first quarter next year. On the other hand, scrap, and a few finished steel products are notably weak. The trade is not expecting much help before the turn of the year and is getting iU house in order to meet any possible pick-up In January or early spring.
Some orders are expected from the automotive makers, and if the railroads reduce wages, a few equipment orders should develop. This prospective business, together with any spurt in demand from miscellaneous consumers of steel, should aid in producing a somewhat better operating rate than that which has been witnessed during the past few months.
Rails Bought on Scale
Accumulation on a scale down came into tbe principal rails on recessions following tbe New York Central announcement. This buying was based on the thought that railway dividend uncertainties were removed as an immediate market factor, eliminating one of the. principal sources of disturbance in the railway group during recent weeks. Moreover, it was felt that the news of two railroad receiverships had been absorbed, and the carrier share list had largely discounted the influence of the most unfavorable conditions in the railway bond market for the last 20 years.
No sustained improvement in railroad stocks is anticipated until increased general business results in a larger traffic movement, and a proportionate gain in railroad earnings. However, hopes of a good-sized rally were entertained in the event of a constructive turn in the wage negotiations. In addition, it was believed that with railroad stocks selling at the lowest average prices since 1893. many opportunities for long-pull investment were presented in this field.
Southern Railway
Southern Railway directors win meet at 11 o’clock this morning to decide on the dividend policy for 1932. Attention will be given to the stock indenture, which is interpreted m some quarters to mean that preferred dividends can be paid only out of net earnings of the preceding year. As the full 5% was set aside out of 1930 earnings for 1931 payments. amount available for disbursement in 1932 is limited to net earnings for 1931. The ten months’ report indicates that Southern will fail this year to cover its preferred dividend requirements of $3,000,000 annually.
Southern earned $4.72 a share on its common stock m 1930. against $11.65 in 1929. Of the latter amount. $S a share was paid in 1930 and the S3 65 balance was declared payable this year. Company paid an additional 35 cents this year nut of 1930 earnings, making total common payments for 1931 $4.
Under a literal Interpretation of the stock indenture, it is thought Southern could pay $4.37 a common share in 1932 if desired, the latter amount being the unappropriated 1930 surplus earnings after preferred requirements, but such action is unlikely.
