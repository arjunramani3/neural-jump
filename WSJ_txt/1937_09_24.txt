BY ROBERT LAFFAN
Heaviness in international issues in London before our market started, gave the local stock market another weak opening Friday. Prices were carried down to new low ground, over a broad area and liquidation was the heaviest noted thus far in the current selling phase.
The usual confused exchange of cables between London and New York again took place, but neither market could fix responsibility for bearishness, for both sources apparently had their quota, of selling orders to execute and the stampede out of common stocks seemed to emanate from all quarters.
Coppers, heavy international favorites, were down at the opening, but they rallied for a
while as the orders of bargain hunters were filled. Some large blocks of Anaconda were turned over in what appeared to be a rallying effort, but this soon subsided and the stock was pressed for sale later and carried down to new low ground for the move, hlotor stocks, which had been giving a good account of themselves in recent sessions, were suported In the first hour, but these issues later succumbed and fell to new lows. Steel common was a target from the start and lost ground heavily. The losses for leading industrial favorites ranged from 2% to 4 points, while greater declines occurred in issues with a thin -market.
It was soon apparent that the recent steadiness of utilities and rails represented a mere pause In the liquidating movement for these groups were again attacked. There was a great deal of forced selling, for margin calls in many brokerage houses were heavier than at any time in several years.
Corporate bonds and commodities also suffered.	*	•	*
OEL—
Evidence" that more oil is being produced in the East Texas field than is economically sound is seen in some oil quarters in the fact that the bottom-hole pressure of the field has dropped at an increasingly higher rate during the past two months. More wells are being placed on the pump every week, and some oil men fear that continuation of the present rate of production and addition of new wells will cause a substantial decrease in the number of gravity-flow wells.

tional markets has led to development of a new hoarding movement in London. Some of the gold mining shares in this country appear to good support during weakness in other sections of the list. While uncertainty is worldwide. the gold hoarding movement In London has not assumed exceptionally heavy proportions and some of the foreign exchange brokers see a favorable aspect in the situation in that it is giving the British Exchange Control the opportunity to dispose of some of the heavy supplies of gold which it was forced to absorb during the gold panic last Spring.
In fact, it is estimated that as a result of this situation the British Control is In a more flexible position to cope with any emergencies which might arise'in the foreign exchange market. What with a weak franc and an active movement of international investment funds under way. it is Important that Great Britain be in a position to act as a stabilizing influence.

Abreast of the Market
-------(Continued from Page Thirteen)----- that the absence of new orders from electrical and automotive outlets is causing’ slower operations in some fabricating plants. The usual, expected August lull in fabricated copper purchases seems to have been extended into September.
At least in the case of wire and cable makers, and to a certain extent among other fabricators, ' the bright spot in the picture is the slight indication that Christmas trade orders are putting in an appearance. The months of October and November arc usually crowded with Chiistmas orders and then activity slumps seasonally to February, when outdoor construction gets under way in some areas.

RAIL. SITUATION—
Although there is still a disposition in some quarters to assign mysterious causes for the market action, most of the better informed Wall Street brokers do not view the situation in this light. The railroad situation alone has presented a serious problem and that accounts for a good deal of the liquidation.
When it is realized that railroad earnings for several months have been making progressively less favorable comparisons with a year ago despite the fact that carloadings are still holding above last year’s levels, that this has led to shut-downs in maintenance shops and almost a complete stoppage of new equipment purchasing, the ramifications of the situation can be understood. For this has caused the abrupt collapse in railroad equipment and railroad securities and it has been a contributing factor in the decline in steel shares for it has meant a loss of business for steel concerns Those things are the direct economic influences of the plight of the railroads. Then there is the psychological effect on investors when they see steel, railroad equipment and rail shares declining.
Whatever other reasons may be assigned for the market break, the squeezing of railroad management between labor demands on one side and an inflexible rate policy on the other must be given prominent notice.

TAXES—
A constructive item in the day’s news was the intimation from Washington that the’ Federal Treasury Department is outlining a program for presentation to Congress calling for amendments to the undistributed profits tax law. It is understood that the plan calls for debt allowance for small concerns The feeling in business and financial quarters is that the modifications should go well beyond that to include large corporations as well. Many corporations are perplexed at the moment, realizing that they must pay out most of this year's earnings to escape undistributed profits taxes and they are not certain that they can raise capital needed for the business due to the unfavorable financing conditions. Some are reported to be seriously considering holding on to their earnings and paying a somewhat stiffer tax.
In distinguishing between large and small corporations, the Treasury department probably is injuring the “little fellow” and allowing the wealthy man to escape. For the big corpora* lions today are owned by numerous small people holding odd lots whereas the ’’small companies” arc in many/>insrtanccs moderately sized companies owned outright by wealthy men.
