Stocks slumped after the government stepped up pressure on the auto industry and raised the prospect that some banks may need large infusions of capital, damping recent optimism that the worst of the market's rout may be over.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday dropped 254.16 points, or 3.3%, to 7522.02 and earlier in the day had fallen 340 points. Of the Dow's 30 components, 28 declined, including General Motors and Citigroup.
GM tumbled 25% to $2.70 after the Obama administration ousted the auto maker's chief executive and indicated it would use bankruptcy filings to purge GM and Chrysler of debt and retiree health-care costs. Any bankruptcy would wipe out shareholders.
The decision surprised investors and followed comments by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Sunday that some banks are still ailing and will need further government aid.
The two combined to rattle investors, who had just helped drive the Dow up 21% in less than three weeks, the quickest such rally since 1938 -- and putting the Dow, by common definition of a 20% move from the low, into a new bull market. While the Dow is up 6.5% this month, it is down 14.3% so far for the first quarter, which ends Tuesday.
Concerns about tumbling demand and rising inventories drove oil prices back below $50 a barrel Monday and also pushed other commodities sharply lower. Crude futures ended down for a second day in a row, off $3.97, or 7.6%, at $48.41 a barrel, the second-biggest daily drop this month. The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index was down 2.8%.
The S&P 500 fell 3.5%, led by a 9.1% slide in its financial sector, which lagged behind other categories early in the session but saw its losses pile up late in the day. All of the broad index's sectors ended lower, including big losses in industrials, off 5.1% as a group; energy, off 3.8%; and basic materials, down 3.5%.
Strategist Bill King, of M. Ramsey King Securities in Burr Ridge, Ill., said the latest developments surrounding GM and Chrysler are disturbing on several levels. For one, the firing of GM CEO Rick Wagoner sets an example that may carry over to other troubled companies. Investors are also skeptical that the government can successfully engineer a turnaround by the car makers, he said.
"These guys have no experience running factories and getting their fingernails dirty," Mr. King said. "But at the same time, you have them running bigger and bigger chunks of the economy."
The ripple effects of the auto industry's news were felt across several industries. Shares of parts makers including Lear and Goodyear Tire & Rubber declined sharply. Alcoa, the aluminum maker, was down 14%, and U.S. Steel plunged 12%. Caterpillar, the maker of heavy equipment, declined 9.3%.
Companies most exposed to the economy's swings also were hurt as prospects of an auto-maker bankruptcy dimmed prospects for an economic recovery.
International Business Machines and Johnson & Johnson were the only two Dow components to rise.
Shares of CBS Corp. slid 18% after UBS cut its investment rating on the broadcaster's shares, citing concerns that the company could lose ad revenue if car makers cut back their purchases of airtime.
