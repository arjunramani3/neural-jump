THE STOCK MARKET
HEAVY LOSSES
Stocks break badly following President’s speech on taxation—"Renewal of German offensive also causes selling—Baldwin breaks—Motors reflect probable tax on luxuries—Rails firm on passenger and freight rate increases.
Sales. 933.500 shares.
With conflicting influences to contend "with, the market in stocks was very irregular during the day. There were a number of unfavorable influences, but the one which worried the market most was the question of increased Federal taxes. Exaggerated reports on the needs of the Government for the current year had spread alarm through lhe Street. President Wilson addressed Congress at 1 o’clock. Market movements up to that time reflected pessimism, but after the speech appeared on the news ticker there seemed to be more optimism. Toward the closing, prices melted away and heavy stop loss orders were encountered.	_
The President made it clear that a large amount oi added revenue would have to be raised and he mentioned war profits, incomes, and luxuries as probable sources for added revenue. The keynote of his speech was an admonishment to the public to practise economy and to prevent inflation.
In view of the President's decided stand for an early redrafting of the revenue act, it seems quite certain that Congress will remain in session to consider new taxes. This is in line with hopes entertained in leading financial quarters. Wall Street has only recently swung around to the view that it would be highly desirable for the business interests of the country to know nt the earliest possible time what taxes arc to be levied on the profits of this calendar year. The President’s admission that there are inequities in the existing statute, brings hope that these inequities will be wiped out in amended legislation.
The tax question, of course, raises a multitude of uncertainties. If taxes were io be doubled this year, for instance, it would stand to reason that conservatism would prevail in the matter of dividend disbursements. These uncertainties will naturally cause irregular market movements. The view pertains in commission houses that stock movements, during the time that new tax legislation is being discounted, will offer opportunities principally for traders.
Long-Awaited Rate Increases nre Announced
Rails opened higher and industrials opened generally lower at the beginning of the now week. The immediate influences affecting trading included announcement of higher passenger and freight rates, renewed agitation over the l-ax program, and a renewal of the German offensive on two fronts.
Rails Show Moderate Enthusiasm
Railroad increases, it was estimated, would bring in tt larger return than was to be expended in the additional wage increases. Railroad stocks made oniv moderate response to tho news sn long awaited. Erie first preferred gained 1% at 33%, the biggest gain in the list. Reading. Central. New Haven. Chesapeake iS- Ohio ami Southern Pacific gained fractionally.	■
Industrials Irregular
Steel common opened off % to 106%, and sold up to 106%. Mexican Petroleum, Distillers, and American Su
matra were lower. Marine preferred gained fractionally in the early trading. Colorado Fuel, in which special developments are said to be pending, gained 1% to 52%.
Reaction
It was announced from Washington shortly after the opening that President Wilson would address Congress at 1 o’clock on the question of tax legislation. When this news appeared, offerings of stocks became heavier. The early gains in the railroad list were nearly all wiped out. Losses in industrials ran from a point to about 3 points. There was no undue pressure in any part of the list, however. 'The unfavorable influences, front the market point of new, outweighed the favorable influences.
Baldwin Breaks
Baldwin broke to 88% for a loss of 2% points. Steel made a low at 106%, off %. Colorado Fuel lost all its gain. Marine pfd., after selling up % to 100%, lost its gain.
Hide & Leather Preferred Higher
One of the exceptions to the general list in the early trading was Hide & Leather pfd., which gained a point to An increase of 2% in the dividend rate of this stock would call for an additional amount of about $250,000 a year. It is anticipated that the $3,000,000 outstanding bonds, due in 1919, can be paid off by maturity. A slight drain on surplus may be necessitated for this purpose.
New German Offensive
The German offensive broke out in the Ypres sector, and also in the Rheims sector, the southernmost point in the battle line opened in March. Dispatches from London ■ndicated that heavy’ artillery fire implied a genuine attempt on the part of the Germans to break through the British and French lines. No details were available to gauge the size of the offensive.
Criticism For Kitchin
Market continued reactionary in the second half hour. The financial district, awaited the speech of the President for a cue on tax legislation. Much criticism was directed against Representative Kitchin of the Ways and Meant Committee. Mr. Kitchin, in an interview which appeared in Sunday’s newspapers, said that, about $2(5,000.000,000 would have to be raised before next. March. This figure is staggering and if this amount must be raised, the situation is more serious titan is generally understood. Mr. Kitchin would raise at least $$.009,000,000 by direct taxation and he would levy at least 87G- of the taxes through a readjustment of rates on excess profits, income, and inheritance taxes. It may be expected that vigorous opposition will meet such a proposal. Senator Lewis of Illinois, who favors enactment of the new bill at the current session of Congress, insists that the '.Vest and North want taxation disposed of now, while the South and East want it postponed.
Heavy Losses
Baldwin Locomotive sold off 3% to $7%. This compares with a high on May 10 of 101%. Steel reacted to 105%, which compares with the year's high of 113%. Marine preferred sold off 2% from the high to 98%. Atlantic Gulf, despite the fact that it. would benefit from general freight increases on coastwise shipping, sold off 1% to 10 < %. Wilson & Co. lost 3 to 00. selling being influenced partly by charges that several packing houses had duped tho army. Rails dropped quickly. From a high oi 43%, New Haven sagged 3 points in ten minutes, and then recovered to 42%.
Rumors Involve Mexico
Mexican Petroleum lost 3% to 92%. This compares with u high of 102%, made May 10. There were reports :n circulation of important political developments in Mexico. These reports implied protection to Mexican Petroleum Co.’s properties.
Bankers Favor Immediate Tax Revision
Stocks made good recoveries from the lows during the second hour. Reassuring statements by bankers on the tax situation influenced trading. These bankers take the view that it would be much better for the business of the country if the tax question were disposed of as soon as possible. It goes without saying that the dividend policies of many corporations would be regulated by the tax program. Any tax imposed by Congress will be retroactive to January 1. 191$. and if a bill were enacted this summer corporations would have six months to adjust themselves accordingly. Tnerv was apparently no advance information in the Street as to tne details of the tax bid.
Good Recoveries
Mexican Petroleum recovered 1 r's to 94. Reports persist that important international matters between United States and Mexico arc pending. From a low of 105%, Steel recovered to lOfi-’v. Crucible was firm. Americnr. Locomotive held well in the face of weakness in Baldwin Locomotive, indicating that the former stock did not attract a big speculative following while Baldwin was soaring. Colorado Fuel went from a low of 49% to 51%. General Motors, which reacted 4',j to 11$, recovered to 119%.
Why Tobaccos arc Favored
.All the tobaccos were strong, and the reason was obvious. The Government, in the first place, has virtually put tobacco in the list of necessary commodities. American soldiers receive regular tobacco rations. In the second place, tobacco can stand an added tax because that tax can be placed on to the consumer, without restricting sales in any large degree.
The President's Speech
Stocks were very irregular while lhe President’s speech was appearing in sections on the news ticker. First they were weak and as the speech reached conclusion, they became strong. Tho President's admission that then? were inequities. In the existing revenue law was a big point. He said that new taxes would probably have to be levied on war profits, incomes and luxuries. Nothing more definite af/penred. On the whole, the attitude of the President was interpreted as eminently fair. He said that sufficient taxes would have to be levied to prevent inflation.
Stocks Conte Back
Steel made a second dip to 105%, and recovered quickly to 106%. Baldwin made a new low at $6%, and then recovered nearly 2 points. Marine preferred made a new low for the day at 97%, yielding the last 2 points in about 5 minutes. But it was rushed up quickly to 99. Motor stocks, on the assumption that passenger cars would 6c put on the luxury list, were weak.
Brunswick Terminal
Activity in Brunswick Terminal and Railway Securities Co. shares was based on reports that the big part of the company’s large holdings of land in Brunswick. Ga., was about to be sold at a very advantageous price. Some time ago Chairman Hurley of the U. S. Shipping Board predicted great things for both Savannah and Brunswick. Brunswick Terminal owns 3,600 city lots in Brunswick and 3,220 acres located within a radius of four miles of the center of the city, aside from its big holdings of land on St. Simon’s Island. A big Government nitrate plant is to be built in Brunswick.
Heavy Realizing
Heavy, stop loss orders were encountered in the clos-
ing hour. Leading industrials added 1 to 3 points to their losses. New lows were‘made in Marine preferred, Baldwin, Distillers, Colorado Fuel, Steel common, and in the copper list. Rails held relatively firm.
Selling pressure was due to uncertainties raised by the proposed tax measure. The German offensive was a much smaller influence than the tax agitation.	_
