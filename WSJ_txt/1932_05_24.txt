The Markets
Stocks Trend Lower—Utilities Particularly Weak—New Lows by North American, Consolidated Gas and Public Service
British bond* on London market eMier; stock* irregular.
Paris Bourse lower.
Weakness in commodity markets, particularly grain and cotton, had its repercussion in the stock market where prices generally moved lower with new low levels being established by many issues. Additional impetus was given to the downward swing by the softer tone in United States government bonds and an unfavorable carloadings report for the week ended May 14, showing 16,010 fewer car loaded than in the previous week.
Utilities were particularly heavy and gave ground easily. New lows were made by Public Service of New Jersey, North American Co,, American Power & Light, Electric Power de Light and American Water Works, and Consolidated Gas.
Carrier Shares Less Susceptible to Pressure
Despite the poorer carloadings' report, the shares of leading railroad companies for the most part of the session were less susceptible to pressure than the remainder of the list, such leaders as Atchison, New York Central and Chesapeake & Ohio being off only fractionally as compared with the previous day's final prices. In the final half hour, however, prices gave ground easily.
Among specialties, Industrial Rayon hit a new low mark of 11%, off more than 3 points on the day. A slight recovery resulted in subsequent trading activity, however. Other leading stocks to penetrate their previous low levels included General Foods, American Tobacco B and R. J. Reynolds B. •
Oil shares, on the whole, displayed the best performance, holding within small fractions of Monday’s closing levels.
Woolworth was inclined to heaviness and sold down more than a point as did Coca-Cola and du Pont.
American Chicle's Earnings Hold Well
Capital stock of American Chicle Co. has been selling at the year's low around 25%, although earnings of the company continue to hold well as compared with 1931. Currently, operations are about 10% below those in the corresponding period of last year. Net income in the first quarter of 89 cents a share covered dividend payment by a margin of 14 cents, the company disbursing a regular payment of 50 cents and an extra of 25 cents.
Since 1923 Chicle's net income has ranged from |2.06 a share to the highest of $6.73 a share, and in the last three years it has ranged from $4.19 to $4.43 a share. For 1931 the net was equal to $4.28 a share, covering the dividend by $1.28, or better than 40%.
The company was in a strong liquid financial position at the close of 1931, its current assets being equal to better than $7 for each $1
of current liabilities. Cash, including call loans, amounted to $865,545, and alone was sufficient to cover total current liabilities by a margin of $156,000. In addition it had marketable securities of $1,278,896.
Rita at ExccMlve Government Coats
’ Citing the menace of excessive costs of government, the New York Trust Co. points out that it can hardly be contended that adequate steps have been taken or even proposed to effect anything approaching the degree of retrenchment obviously imperative. "Consider, for example, the economy measures proposed by the federal administration when confronted with a deficit for the firseal years 1931-32,33, estimated by President Hoover at $4,442,000,000,” it states.
"Presenting bis budget, on December 9 last, the President recommended adoption of the Treasury plan calculated to increase taxation by $920,000,000. Subsequently, the Treasury revised its figures and asked for new taxes amounting to $1,123,000,000. Against this enormous increase in taxation, President Hoover has claimed that the budget for the fiscal year ending June, 1933, represents a reduction, compared with the 1932 level, of $369,000,000 in expenditures. He also has called upon Congress to make a further reduction of $200,000,000.
"Accordingly, on the face of the figures, by economies effected or proposed, taxpayers would be saved $569,000,000, but at the same time, w6uld be required to pay additional taxes of nearly twice that amount.”
Member Bank Loan Liquidation,Continue*
The statement of reporting member banks in leading cities for the week ended May 18 showed a continuation of the liquidation of loans that has been so pressing in recent weekB, although the declines were smaller than in the preceding week. Loan* on securities dropped $27,000,000 against $86,000,000 the preceding week, while all other loans were off $29,000,000 against $39,000,000. Investments in nongovernment securities showed a slight increase, $4,000,000, but there was a $51,000,000 drop in holdings of government securities.
Reserve deposits continued to advance, with this past week's gain $36,000,000. There was also a sharp gain in reserve deposits of rural banks (non-reporting member banks). Country banks paid off $11,000,000 of borrowings from the Reserve banks, in contrast to a $5,000,000 increase shown by reporting member banks. Rural banks are currently borrowing only $285.000,000 fom the Federal a* against a peak of $371,000,000 in January.
The decline in demand deposits, $12,000,000, was in line with the usual seasonal movement and does not indicate a reversal of the recent upward trend. However, the $35,000,000 drop in time deposits wiped out a large part of the expansion since mid-ApriL
