On top of surging oil and news of an unexpectedly high May unemployment rate, investors faced reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether American International Group overstated the value of insurance arrangements involving subprime mortgages and that National City Corp.'s banking arm is operating under a special "memorandum of understanding" with federal regulators.

Friday's stock-market slide was the strongest sign yet that stock investors are picking up on something credit markets have been warning about recently: The financial crisis isn't over.
The drop of 394.64 points, or 3.13%, to 12209.81 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average reflected a resurgence of recession fears that some stock investors had been trying to put aside. The Dow now is down 14% from its October record of 14164.53.
Until Friday, hopes had been spreading that financial stocks might have hit bottom. But on Friday, banking stocks as a group fell more than 5%.
On top of surging oil and news of an unexpectedly high May unemployment rate, investors faced reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether American International Group overstated the value of insurance arrangements involving subprime mortgages and that National City Corp.'s banking arm is operating under a special "memorandum of understanding" with federal regulators.
AIG fell 6.8%, the day's biggest percentage decliner among the 30 members of the Dow. National City fell 7.5%.
Morgan Stanley declined 8.5%, and Goldman Sachs Group, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers Holdings all fell more than 4%. Citigroup was off 5.5%, J.P. Morgan Chase gave up 4.8% and Bank of America retreated 4.7%. Wachovia fell 6.8%.
"The brokerage-firm earnings reports due out over the next two weeks will be very key for the sentiment of the market going forward," said Stephen Sachs, director of trading at mutual-fund group Rydex Investments in Rockville, Md.
Renewed recession fears also sent money into Treasurys, which had been declining as recession fears faded. The 10-year Treasury note rose 24/32, or $7.50 per $1,000 invested, pushing down the yield to 3.936%.
Stocks have been soft in June, but some traders had seen Thursday's gain of nearly 214 points in the Dow as a sign that the pullback would be limited.
Now, they say, they will be waiting to see whether Friday's big decline will be a one-day scare or something that shows signs of continuing into the coming week.
