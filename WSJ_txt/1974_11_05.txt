Industrials Chalk Up Climb of 17.52 to 674.75 After Shaking Off Fears About Coal Walkout
By Victor J. Hillery
In a surprising display of vigor for a semiholiday session, the stock market yes- J terday shook off some coal-strike worries i and racket, up a sharp and broad gain. | After recouping a small early loss, the i Dow Jones industrial average sprinted 17.52 points to 674.75. This surpassed the high watermarks of two surges last month —673.50 on Oct. 14 and 673.03 on Oct. 30. In : the previous three sessions the indicator had retreated a total of 15.80 points.
.Weakness in stock prices Monday had followed news that the coal-labor talks had reached an impasse Sunday night. But investors were relieved, brokers said, when talks were resumed Monday night with indications that additional sessions would follow. Traders also were encouraged by the market's refusal to give up much ground Monday in the face of a wave of negative developments.
Although some banks and other institutions were closed for Election Day, trading on the New York Stock Exchange expanded to 15,960,000 shares from 12,740,000 the day before. Indicative of the institutional activity, trades of 10,000 shares or more rose to 104 from Monday’s revised total of 86.
Gainers Swamped Losers
After trailing early in the session. Big Board gainers led by better than two-to-one at the close, with 991 stocks up and 394 down. Issues that sank to new 1974 lows decreased to 19 from 35 Monday and new highs climbed to 11 from four.
Easing short-term interest rates continued to give the market firm support. A few more banks yesterday lowered their prime lending rates to 10%%; others were at 11% and still more at 11%%.
Jacques S. Theriot, Smith, Barney & Co. first vice president, said that “much of the recent sharp swings in the popular averages on moderate volume" is due to the “illiquidity on the downside as well as the upside." And this, he added, results from “a lack of dealer trading.”
When the industrial average fell below the 600 level, said Hugh A Johnson Jr., vice president of Hugh Johnson & Co., “we think the market discounted the worst of the economic forecasts.”
He said he expects the decline in the real gross national product to continue "at least through the first quarter of 1975, and probably through the first half." But he said, too, that "there’s some evidence of moderation in the rate of inflation" and cited the “smaller rise In September’s industrial wholesale price index.” This, he added, "will allow for a further reduction in credit restrictions by the Federal Reserve Board."
Some brokers also attributed yesterday’s rise to expectations “of a Democratic sweep” in the national elections They cited a belief among some Investors that "Democrats would be more amenable to measures that would stimulate the economy."
The American Stock Exchange index climbed 0.60 to 69.78; advances held better than a three-to-two lead over losers. Turnover quickened to 2,090,000 shares from 1,530,000 Monday.
Prices of prime corporate bonds continued to rally and finished up an average of about % in very light trading. The market for federal securities was closed.
Stocks swept higher on the Big Board in yesterday’s advance included computer, defense, housing, chemical, copper, retail, drug, electronic, machinery, movie, auto, oil, television and tobacco issues.
Strength among glamours was ascribed partly to Bhort covering, or buying of stock to replace borrowed shares sold earlier. Polaroid, second most active, climbed 2% to 24%. McDonald’s, in ninth place, gained 2% to 36%. MGIC, also active, advanced 1% to 8%.
