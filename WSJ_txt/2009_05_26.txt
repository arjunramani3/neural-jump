First Solar (Nasdaq) fell 12.21, or 6.4%, to 179.51 after FBR Capital Markets analyst Mehdi Hosseini said the solar-power modules maker's stock will be pressured by the decline in polysilicon prices amid weak demand in Europe.

A more-confident consumer translated into a rallying stock market as J.P. Morgan Chase and American Express paced a nearly 200-point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with a flood of consumer stocks going along for the ride.
With the Conference Board saying its index of consumer confidence for May jumped to its highest reading since September, investors pushed into nearly every sector. Financials were led by J.P. Morgan Chase, up $2.13, or 6.2%, to $36.54, and American Express, up 1.17, or 5%, to 24.57.
"There is a positive correlation between consumer confidence and market confidence," said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist for Hartford Financial Services. She noted the fact "that there isn't a flood of money coming makes a big difference."
Home builders were particularly strong, with D.R. Horton tacking on 46 cents, or 5.1%, to 9.47. Other consumer stocks moving higher included Tiffany, up 1.67, or 6.3%, to 28.09, and Host Hotels & Resorts, up 81 cents, or 9.9%, to 9.01.
In addition, Polo Ralph Lauren gained 4.36, or 8.7%, to 54.38 ahead of its quarterly report on Wednesday.
Technology started out strong even before release of the consumer-confidence figure, and the sector stayed higher, with the Nasdaq Composite Index closing up 58.42 points, or 3.45%, to 1750.43. The Nasdaq marked its highest close since May 6.
Apple (Nasdaq) jumped 8.28, or 6.8%, to 130.78. Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on the technology giant to overweight from equal-weight, saying the iPhone "is feeding earnings growth that the market is missing."
First Solar (Nasdaq) fell 12.21, or 6.4%, to 179.51 after FBR Capital Markets analyst Mehdi Hosseini said the solar-power modules maker's stock will be pressured by the decline in polysilicon prices amid weak demand in Europe.
Also rising in the consumer sector, Wendy's/Arby's Group advanced 22 cents, or 5.2%, to 4.42, as it said it will open more than 35 Wendy's locations in Singapore over the next decade as the fast-food chain continues to expand outside North America.
Shares of mining-equipment companies Joy Global (Nasdaq), up 3.07, or 11%, to 32.30, and Bucyrus International (Nasdaq), up 2.13, or 8.9%, to 25.96, increased as KeyBanc upgraded both stocks, saying a climb in commodity prices should eventually pull companies back to the mine shafts.
Analysts at J.P. Morgan raised their rating on multimedia company Qwest Communications International to overweight from neutral, citing "relatively strong enterprise revenue trends, conservative guidance, upside from potential [mergers and acquisitions], as well as an attractive valuation." Qwest closed up 32 cents, or 8%, at 4.33.
Bucking the trend of strong financials, Regions Financial fell 21 cents, or 5.2%, to 3.83.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 196.17 points, or 2.37%, to 8473.49, snapping a four-day losing streak. The index, which had its biggest point and percentage gains since May 18, is down 6.2% from its 2009 closing high of 9035, reached on Jan. 2.
Among other indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.33, or 2.63%, to 910.33, also snapping a four-day losing streak.
Every sector in the S&P 500 traded in the black, with financials and consumer discretionaries pacing the move.
A Day in the Dow Up 196.17 points, or 2.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 8473.49. There were 28 risers, 2 decliners. In positive territory for 96% of the day. Off 5,691.04 points, or 40.2%, from its record close of 14164.53 hit on Oct. 9, 2007. Down 32.5% from 52 weeks ago. Up 29.4% from its 12-year closing low of 6547.05 hit on March 9. Off 6.2% from its 2009 closing high of 9034.69 hit on Jan. 2. Month-to-date, it is up 3.74%. Year-to-date, it is down 3.45%. Source: WSJ Market Data Group
