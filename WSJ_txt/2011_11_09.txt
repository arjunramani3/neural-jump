Financial shares led the decline -- the S&P Financials index dropped 5.4% -- as concerns mounted that tumbling European debt values could hurt U.S. banks.

Just when stock investors dared to hope that the market's swings were over, the wild days are back.
As concerns about the euro zone escalated on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 389.24 points, or 3.2%, to 11780.94. The decline was the Dow's biggest in seven weeks and the sixth largest for the year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.7%, its worst one-day drop since Aug. 18, and tipped back into the red for the year. Just one of the index's 500 stocks, Best Buy, rose. Financial shares led the decline -- the S&P Financials index dropped 5.4% -- as concerns mounted that tumbling European debt values could hurt U.S. banks.
The decline followed several days of swings amid alternating optimism and fears about the likelihood of a resolution to Europe's debt crisis. The moves were reminiscent of the summer volatility. But many investors had been lulled by a strong stock performance in October, when the Dow gained 9.5%. That rise encouraged investors to predict that the market would continue its rally into the end of the year. They also had hoped to take their eyes off headlines in Europe to focus on company earnings and economic data in the U.S., which have showed signs of improvement.
Four weeks ago, Scott Redler, chief strategic officer at T3 Trading Group, blasted a note to fellow traders, predicting that stocks likely had seen the year's low in early October. But the picture has since changed, said Mr. Redler, who thinks the market is unlikely to rise substantially from here.
"Reality is setting in, and markets have been trying to ignore it, but the size of the headlines and the systemic nature of this are making it all worse," he said.
Financials and materials stocks, the worst-performing sectors this year, led Wednesday's declines.
J.P. Morgan Chase fell 7.1%, Morgan Stanley tumbled 9% and Goldman Sachs Group shed 8.2%. Some investors fear the three firms, whose shares tumbled in September amid worries about their exposure to French banks, could face losses if financial problems deepen in Italy.
The broad losses came as Italian government-bond yields soared to euro-era highs. Meantime, questions about who would take the reins in Greece added to the list of uncertainties weighing on investors' minds. Many investors scurried out of the euro, which fell 2.1%, to $1.3542, its biggest one-day drop in six months. Investors piled into the perceived safety of Treasurys, which sent the yield on the 10-year note back below 2%, to a one-month low of 1.954%.
In the U.S., the week has been unusually sparse in terms of economic data or central-bank announcements, and earnings reports have slowed to a trickle. That has enabled the troubles in Europe to take much of U.S. investors' attention.
European stocks finished lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 lost 1.7%, Germany's DAX index fell 2.2% and Italy's FTSE MIB index dropped 3.8%.
In corporate news, General Motors lost $2.73, or 11%, to $22.31 after the auto maker provided a downbeat outlook.
Ralph Lauren fell 9.11, or 5.7%, to 149.94, after the high-end apparel maker missed earnings expectations. Retailer Macy's fell 1.71, or 5.3%, to 30.45, as third-quarter earnings jumped, but profit margins narrowed more than Wall Street expected.
Early Thursday in Asia
Tokyo shares fell sharply in early trading Thursday after Wall Street's declines. The Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.8% at the opening bell, reversing gains of 1.2% the day before.
