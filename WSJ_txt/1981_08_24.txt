Stocks Plummet in Active Trading As Interest Rates Stir Investor Fear
By Victor J. Hillekv
Battered by concern about continuing high interest rates and their expected impact on the economy, the stock market plunged across a broad front yesterday in active trading. The Dow Jones industrial average took its biggest drop since January, falling to its lowest level in more than 13 months.
Oil and oil-service issues were among the biggest casualties.
The industrial average, which was off 16.36 points last week, began yesterday with a loss of about eight points and closed at 900.11. off 20.46 points. That was the index’s sharpest setback since a 23.80-pomt drop Jan. 7 and its lowest level since it closed at 891.13 July 11, 1980.
The transportation indicator skidded 12.89 points to 382.90, its biggest loss since the average was revised in January 1970. The utility average also fell.
“Interest rates are the stock market's real problem, stirring investor fears that rates haven’t peaked yet and that they will bring on a credit crunch,” commented Fred W. Lange, consultant to Colin Hochs-tin Co.

Abreast of tlie
A belief that the Federal Reserve will continue to
Market
maintain a restrictive monetary policy, keeping interest rates high, was reinforced by the news late Friday that the nation’s basic money supply or Ml-B, increased $800 million in the week ended Aug. 12. Many analysts had been expecting a drop.
Part of the reason that rates haven’t de-
clined is "concern that the Reagan administration's tax cuts wouldn’t produce a budget surplus as had been promised.” commented Paul J. Markowski, economist at Sterling, Grace & Co. However, he looks for a slide in money rates to begin next month.
“While President Reagan has made great strides in getting his programs in place, he still has to deliver on performance,” asserted Robert Farrell, vice president of market analysis at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. He added that if this means “pain in the form of sustained high interest rates and more recession,” investors’ enthusiasm and confidence could melt rapidly.
The drop in the industrial average of about 100 points from mid-June to last week was accepted_complacently without a sense of panic, said Dick Yashewski, technical analyst at Butcher & Singer Inc Thus, he believes the market may be in for another big drop
More Institutional Activity
Big Board volume was heaviest m the first and final hours; for the day it totaled 46,750,000 shares, up from 37,670,000 Friday. Somewhat greater institutional activity was mirrored in the 617 trades of at least 10,000 shares, up from 585 in the pre-
vious session.
Among the recently strong takeover issues, Cities Service, an active issue, droped 5% to 60%. Last week, Nu-West Group said it talked with Mesa Petroleum and others about the possible sale of its 7.2% stake in Cities Service. Cities Service said yesterday it is adding Mesa Pete as a defendant in its lawsuit filed m June against Nu-West and others.
