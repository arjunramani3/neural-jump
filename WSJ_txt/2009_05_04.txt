Upbeat economic data and anticipation of results of the government's bank stress tests sparked a surge in stocks that left the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index with a yearly gain for the first time since early January.
The buying gained momentum after new government data showed the first increase in U.S. construction spending in six months and a 3.2% jump in pending home sales.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 214.33 points, or 2.6%, to 8426.74, its highest close since Jan. 13, but still down nearly 4% this year.
The S&P leapt 3.4% to 907.24, now up 0.4% in 2009. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks finished at its highest close since early January, rising 4.1% to 506.82, and like the S&P is now on the plus side for 2009, with a gain of 1.5%.
In another sign of optimism about the economy, oil futures rose 2.4% to $54.47 a barrel, the highest price since late November. Crude has gained more than 9% in the past four trading days.
Bank stocks, which sometimes have been hurt by concerns about the stress tests, rallied. Bank of America and Citigroup -- two Dow components that last week were reported to need additional capital under the government's assessment -- rose 19% and 7.7%, respectively.
Wells Fargo rose 24% Monday amid fresh reports that it, too, will need to raise cash.
"We've reached a point where the selloffs are short-lived," said futures broker Bill Frejlich, of Fox Investments in Chicago. "Even if you get a downdraft, it lasts a week or so, then you get a new high because people are looking for entry points to the market."
