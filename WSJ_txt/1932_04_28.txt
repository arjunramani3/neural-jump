Abreast of the Market
By Henry E. Rose
Bonds in the London market held fairly firm while stocks trended lower* particular weakness In Swedish Match B.
Price movements on the Berlin Boerse were irregular.
Influenced by liquidation and lower quotations in commodities' markets, price movements on the New York Stock Exchange trended downward with losses In the main body of stocks ranging from fractions to several points. Wheat, corn, cotton and cottonseed oil all sold off as compared with Wednesday’s closing quotations; May corn, in Chicago, established a new low price since September, 1898.
Turnover in early dealings were not of sub-stantal proportions, indicating the virtual absence of necessitous liquidation. Particular weakness was displayed by Auburn which, after an opening slightly below the previos day’s final, lost 6% points.
Other issues to suffer substantial setbacks wore American Smelting preferrol, Colorado & Southern common, Delaware & Hudson, Glidden preferred, New York Shipbuilding preferred and Pittsburgh Steel preferred.
Leading rail shares, in initial dealings, were at higher levels than on Wednesday but in line with the general downward movement, slumped subsequently with sizable losses throughout the group. The decision of tjie Pennsylvania Railroad to defer dividends was a factor contributing adversely to price movements in the rail group.
Foreign Bank Statements More Cheerful
Developments abroad continued more encouraging, although the current Bank of England return shows a number of wide changes which are difficult to interpret because of the fluctuations in sterling and the bank’s activity In the foreign exchange market. Thus, government security holdings are up about £5,000,000, while other securities, excepting discounts and advances, are down £6,500,000.
Whether these changes result from measures by the bank to support sterling in its recent declines, or whether there has been a shift of securities between the issue and banking departments is not reflected by the statement. It is possible, however, to exchange securities from the account in back of the fiduciary issue for securities in the banking department, or vice versa, without the changes being revealed in the figures at hand.
Decline of £1,500,000 in circulation increased reserves by a similar amount, resulting in an improvement in the reserve ratio to 37.3% from 86.1%. Bankers’ deposits dropped about £14,000,000, but public deposits (for the Treasury) increased a similar amount, probably because of Treasury financing of Bome sort.
The Bank of France gold reserves rose to a new high during the week ended April 22 at fr. 77,480,000,000. The Increase of fr. 400,000,000 consisted largely of American shipments. Total balances abroad declined a further fr. 200,000,000, with sight balances increasing fr. 150,000,000 and bill holdings dropping fr. 350,000,000. On the liability side, circulation declined fr. 700,-! 000,000, but private deposits advanced fr. 1,300,- | 000,000, thus reducing the reserve ratio to 70.21% from 70.80%.	|
Shoe Output Tapering Off Currently
Shares of shoe manufacturing companies, in face of general weakness in other principal groups, have held fairly stable in recent ses
sions. These companies, until a short while ago, were producing at a rate in excess of last year, with output for the first three months showing an increase of 6%, at 77,800,000 pairs.
In line with the seasonal trend, however, production has tapered pff and the April total probably wll be markedly below that for March.
The leading manufacturers—International Shoe and Endicott Johnson—participated in the improvement in the early months of this year. These companies issue only semi-annual reports of operations and since their fiscal years close on November 30, there still remain about six weeks in the first half. Thus, with a general declining trend in the industry, it is difficult to forecast earnings in the initial period of the current fiscal year.
International Shoe Strong Cash Position
International Shoe, the largest manufacturer in the world, has continued its regular dividend rate of $3 annually, the last quarterly of 75 cents being declared in March. Its earnings in .the fiscal year ended November 30, 1931, totaled $9,744,815, after charges, equal to $2.60 a share, or 40 cents less than dividend requirements. The company, however, was in a strong cash position, the total cash and call loans being $21,382,687, or slightly more than $6 per shore on the 3,510,000 shares of common outstanding. Its ratio of current assets to current liabilities stood at about 20 to 1.
Until about a month ago, Endicott-Johnsor Corp., the second largest manufacturer in tbif country, shipped about 20% more shoes than in the similar period a year ago, with dollai sales registering a gain of about 15%. Itt operating status showed marked improvement last year, when, in the 11 months ended No* vember 28, it reported profit of $4.84 a share on common stock against but 14 cents in the full year 1930.
Attack Excessive Governmental Spending
With tax matters prominently to the fore in Congress, and their consequent effect upon a balanced budget, the Guaranty Trust Co. has garnered some Interesting statistics on the combined federal, state and local government expenditures, which, in 1929, were 347% larger than in 1913. During the same period, the national income increased only 148% and the population only 25.9%.
Governmental expenditures, based on figures by the National Industrial Conference Board increased twice as fast as national income and more than three times as fast as population. Preliminary estimates place the national income in 1931 at about $52,500,000,000 and the total governmental expenditures at $14,000,000,000. If these figures are correct, they mean, that more than one-fourth of every person's time last year was apent in earning money to be paid out In taxes.
“As far as the federal government Is con cerned," states the Guaranty Trust Co., ”th< situation has reached a point where ncithei more borrowing nor more taxation can be re sorted to without a threat of disastrous re suits. The American people in general do not realize to what extent the scale of federal gov* emment costs has increased in the last fev years. For some time after the end of the World War, economy was practiced; the public debt was reduced, and Federal tax rates were lowered. Now the situation Is reversed, and the Federal government has joined state and loca governments in the list of excessive spenders.’ and Public Service of New Jersey disclosed onlj fractional losses of and *£ points, respectively.
