Stocks closed higher Friday despite a disappointing drop in consumer spending, as investors were encouraged by an increase in consumer sentiment and a lack of negative news out of the euro zone. Pfizer, Microsoft and Boeing were among the day's gainers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38.54 points, or 0.38%, to 10211.07. For the week, the measure gained 2.81%, snapping a three-week losing streak and marking the Dow's biggest weekly gain since February. It is now up 0.73% for the month but down 2.08% for the year.
Pfizer was the Dow's best performer, jumping 55 cents, or 3.7%, to $15.46. The drug maker and Bristol-Myers Squibb said they stopped a clinical trial early because the data so far suggest an experimental drug for irregular heart rhythm was superior to aspirin. Bristol-Myers Squibb, which isn't a Dow component, rose 44 cents, or 1.8%, to $25.08.
Among the Dow's other top performers, Microsoft (Nasdaq) climbed 66 cents, or 2.6%, to 25.66, and Boeing advanced 1.49, or 2.3%, to 65.38.
The Nasdaq Composite rose 24.89, or 1.12%, to 2243.60. The measure climbed 1.1% this week.
The Standard & Poor's 500 added 4.76, or 0.44%, to 1091.60, with the materials and technology sectors leading its gains. Just two categories ended the session in the red: consumer staples and utilities. The S&P 500 rose 2.51% this week, its biggest weekly gain since early March.
Friday's stock gains came despite a Commerce Department report that showed U.S. consumers pulled back their spending on things from cars to clothing last month, sending retail sales tumbling 1.2%. It was the first drop in retail sales since September and came as a surprise as economists were expecting a 0.2% increase.
However, a Reuters/University of Michigan report showed consumer sentiment rose more than expected, which helped ease investors' concerns about consumer spending in the future. The report prompted stocks' earlier declines to pare, although major stock measures didn't turn positive until late in the session.
American depositary shares of Spanish banking giant Banco Santander climbed 64 cents, or 6.5%, to 10.55, after Chairman Emilio Botin said the company expects to have a similar net profit this year as in 2009, despite economic uncertainty and weakness in Spain.
First Solar (Nasdaq) dropped 2.09, or 1.9%, to 107.27, after Cantor Fitzgerald started coverage of the stock with a "sell" rating, citing the solar company's exposure to Europe. The firm said about 86% of First Solar's 2009 revenue came from the euro zone.
National Semiconductor advanced 68 cents, or 5%, to 14.21. The company swung to a fiscal fourth-quarter profit following $116.1 million in prior-year charges while demand increased for analog products from the wireless handset and industrial markets.
