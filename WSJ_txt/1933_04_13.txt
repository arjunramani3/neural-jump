Securities and commodities staged general and wide advances yesterday, moving forward once more under heavy buying after two days of minor reaction. The rally in stocks and commodities was touched off in the late morning by a sharp break in the dollar in the foreign exchange markets and renewed inflation talk. In stocks, gains were most pronounced in issues whose fluctuations are intimately connected "with the movement of commodities. Advances ran to 3 points or more in the active trading favorites.
The basis for the recovery certainly did not lie entirely in the talk of inflation which went the rounds, for bonds shared largely in the upswing. Even government obligations were firm, and the domestic corporation list ranged generally higher, in a moderately active market. High-grade railroad and utility issues were up, and some wide gains were scored in industrial obligations. German issues rallied after an early reaction.	*
The turnabout in stocks came suddenly, around noon, and the list pushed forward under aggressive buying. Short covering was a substantial factor in the uprush, some bear traders closing out commitments due to unwillingness to hold their positions over the holiday. All groups of stocks shared in the upswing and many issues made new highs for the year.
The major news of the day from Washington was the passage by the lower House of the farm mortage relief bill. A proposal that a currency inflation measure be substituted for the Administration's bill was ruled out of order by Speaker Rainey.
Markets abroad were generally irregular. In ~	' numerous issues ran up on the bourse,
‘	"	In London,
is reported to be producing in the neighbor-' hood of 4,000 barrels of 18 gravity crude oil dally from a'” depth of l,€50 feet. The well stands in 15 feet of water at low tide, and is readily accessible to shallow draft tankers. The well is the third completed on the tract. The other two were failures.
Loans Down; Market Unchanged
The contrast between the present level of the market compared with a year ago, and the level of “street” loans and brokers' loans currently, compared with a year ago, is striking, and lends force to “the argument, many times advanced, that during the past year stocks have been moving from weak into strong hands.
At the close Thursday, the Dow-Jones industrial average stood at 62.69 and the rail average at 26.60. A year' ago, the industrial average was at 63.27, just fractionally above Thursday's* finish, and the rail average was at 22.15, 4.45 points under the level a year previous.	-
Both brokers' loans and “street” loans are heavily under the levels at which they stood a year ago. The latest statement shows brokers' loans at $375,000,000, against $485,000,000 a year ago, a decline of $110,000,000, or about 23%. 'Street” loans at the end of March totaled $310,961,581 compared with $533,103,059, a drop of $222,141,478, or a little more than 40%.
The Stellar Performers
The most pronounced advances in yesterday's market were scored by preferred stocks of companies which are in strong financial position. American Locomotive preferred closed at 35, up 7’A on the day, and American Brake Shoe & Foundry finished at 75, up 7. filternational Silver preferred was another stellar performer.
Steady buying has been coming into American Locomotive preferred, based partly on the company’s strong financial position and partly on the prospects of some improvement in its business, with any upturn in railroad traffic. At the end of 1932, net quick assets of the company were equal to around $49 a share on American Locomotive preferred. Brake Shoe at the end of 1932 had a current ratio of better than IS to 1.
As far as International Silver preferred goes, cash and Government bonds at the end of 1932 totaled roughly $1,825,000. After deducting all current liabilities, cash and goyfframe^tg alone were equal to $26.60 a share on the preferred. In addition, the company had investments in railroad, municipal and other bonds worth $968,264, or roughly $15 a share, and silver inventories, at lower of cost or market, of $4,274,414, equal to approximately $70 a share.,

Steel Company Paypointe Lower	Omitted dividends . ..
The remarks of T. M. Girdler at the annual Increased dividends’ meeting of stockholders, discussing the operat-	-
ing level at which Republic Steel could increase its cash, calls attention again to the fact that the steel makers have brought down costs sharply in the last few years. Mr. Girdler told Republic's stockholders that the company could hold its own on a cash basis with operations at 25% of capacity. Such a showing would have been impossible three years ago.
Another steel maker with a low paypoint is Gulf States. With operations at around 30% or 31% of capacity, the company can cover its fixed charges, and increase its cash position substantially. The ability of steel makers to improve their cash positions, even when they are not quite covering fixed charges, is due, of course, to the fact that their heavy depreciation charges entail no actual loss of cash, but are merely bookkeeping items.
Oil companies are. perhaps, the most striking examples of industrial companies which have been able to hold, or improve, their cash positions in spite of the fact that they showed large annual losses. In the oil business, depreciation write-downs are about the most important charge against earnings.
Rising Scrap Prices and Railroads
Higher prices for steel scrap are making railroad officials look over antiquated equipment that has been on their hands for some time with an eye to getting rid of it. As long as steel scrap was very low prices, railroad executives held off on breaking up old cars, but if the current rise continues, they will pursue a more vigorous polcy in getting rid of them.
Wehther or not this equipment is replaced by new cars and locomotives in the near future depends on the course of railroad traffic. If the trend is upward, considerable equipment buying may be anticipated, because railroads will have actual need-of both cars and motive power. Otherwise, the railroads will pursue a waiting policy, and gradually weed out the old rolling stock which is most expensive to operate. In so doing, they will be paving the way for purchases of new equipment when the traffic upturn does come.
Cord Corp, and Auburn
Cases before the Board of Tax Appeals in Washington sometimes develop some rather interesting news items. The petition of the Cord Corp, for redetermination of a deficiency income fax assessment of $326,826 for 1930 is an example. The company reported Income for the year of $273,942 and the Bureau of Internal Revenue Increased the amount to $3,016,543, basing the increase on what the board held were profits on dealings in Auburn stock made during the year. While the financial community has been fully aware of the close affiliation between the Cord Corp, and Auburn, it had not realized that the company had made any such large profits in trading Jn Auburn stock.
National Distillers
National Distillers turned upward again Thursday. The stock has been a firm spot since passage by Congress of the Celler bill, providing for liberalization of the provisions of the law covering distribution of whisky by prescriptions. Within a week or ten days, full details of the new distribution basis are likely to be agreed National Distillers has an inventory of roughly 600,000 cases of aged whisky, and stands to benefit from the liberalization of the law.
