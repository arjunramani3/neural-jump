FEATURES OF THE MARKET.
RENEWED LIQUIDATION—DEPRESSED CLOSE.
Short Covering Fails t-> Ckr.'k the Decline—Steady Reaii-ing of	s-*;/!*■;<'	—H eakncss in the
Metal Markets Rejected in the Industrial
List—.V<> Support From Leading
Financial interests.
At tho opening tho market was heavy in spite of fair support. Some attempt was made in the first hour to run prices up a little, but floor traders employed for this purpose, reported that they ran into such an undeniable volume of long stock that such orders were at once withdrawn. From that point the market movement was steadily downwards. Stock.-5 did no; get out of hand, but the smallest rally brought out fresh selling, in the last hour or so there was some slight recovery on the covering ot shorts, but the last ten minutes witnessed another drive which closed the market practically at the low figures of the day. It is impossible to name any one influence responsible for the whole movement. The ugly break in the metal market affecting iead, tin, bar silver and less important metals was doubtless a good reason for nervousness in a well defined group of industrials, which should of course include Smelters. It might even fairly affect consumers like General Electric, as indicating a falling off in business and consequent consumptive demand. The rest of the market, however, was equally weak. The active railroad stocks, which have been the leaders, lost from one to three points without the least sign of an aggressive movement against the shorts. It is increasingly apparent that conditions in one respect have radically changed. The selling apnar'.ntly is still liquidation for wealthy holders of stuc.ij. The selling of preferred stocks in particular means the opening of investors’ boxes, and probably tflso the forced liquidation of loans, which it is hopeless any ionger to margin. What seems at ieast as reasonable as any other hypothesis is that the disgraceful traction revelations, coming up top of all the opprobrium which has been cast ju-’.iy or unjustly on modern financial methods, has created a deep feeling of distrust resulting in liquidation at the time when ail the world wants money.
Among the railroad stocks Northern Pacific. Missouri Pacific and less active issues lost over three points, while declines of a point to two points were the rule, with few exceptions of consequence.
The industrials were equally depressed, with losses of over five points in Smelters and American Sugar, four in Consolidated Gas, and from one to three points elsewhere. B. R. T. made a aimiiur decline.
Canadian Pacific was very weak, although the stock still commands a small premium in the loan crowd. It is likely that a good deal of stock liquidated recently will be delivered at the London settlement just concluded. This ought to arrive here October 21, when the supply of stock in this market should be better.
B. R. T. still continues to come out quietly as the time for its examination by the Public Utilities Commission approaches. There are a good many politicians among the holders of the stock and it is these who are showing nervousness principally, although there has been some Boston selling.
Newborg & Co. and other arbitrage houses had advices from Amsterdam that the situation there was much clearer. Some buying of stocks at that point was also reported.
One of the floor traders, who was employed to bid up the market in the rally of the first half hour, said that he thought the stock came rather easily, and was therefore inclined to think that there was still much liquidation in sight.
Halle A Stieglitz were the early sellers of St. Paul, which has been acting badly lately.	.
One of the most serious bear arguments on American Smelting and a reason for the weakness at present was the serious decline in bar stiver. The Guggenheim following has boasted that it was the market in that metal, but since the break and the unloading of silver by India and China, the predominating position of the Guggenheim interest has been minimized.
The demoralization in all metal markets, but pari ticularly copper, is becoming a still more widely felt in-1 fluence. The break includes tin and lead, and it is hard to convince many traders who admit the intrinsic cheapness of stocks that the iron market will not suffer also.
Traders report the bear party determined to get Steel stocks down, although the support there has hitherto been among the best in the list. E. A C. Randolph were the most formidable sellers of the common, putting out some 10,000 shares. They found support, but after they had finished the stock was under pressure and the support seemed to be weakening.
One reason for the weakness in Gas is that some very well informed people believe that the investigation in the traction situation will lead very close to some old trails which the Consolidated Gas interests would like to keep covered up, especially in view of their action pending on 80-cent gas- There has never been a time when the Ryan and Brady following have been so seared as at present. It is unfortunate for them that they have antagonized the politicians by leaving them in the lurch after promising ' that they should have a 25-point move in Interborough. They got it, but in the wrong direction.
■ London probably sold about 12,000 shares on balance
in the first hour, buying very little. On the'London Curb .the trading was a little more active and probably the total sales here amounted to 25,000 shares, including a good deal more of the copper stocks than London has sold lately.
The London settlement passed off very satisfactorily with no failures, but foreign houses had rumors of what amounted to a panic in the Shanghai metal market, which is one of the great markets of the world and probably the greatest in the East for silver, copper and tin. It was this development which was responsible for the foreign selling after the London market had closed.
The most important support in U. S. Steel was by G. C. Miller, who usually devotes most of his attention to Union Pacific, but bought 20,000 shares of Steel common; and Marshall, Spader & Co., who bought anything up to 15,000 shares. There was a good deal of talk of Morgan support in the market. In both cases the stock seemed to come out rather easily.
One of the unfavorable influences in American Smelting in well informed circles was the report received through Gorman houses here of serious trouble in the Shanghai silver market.
Traders still reported that long stock was coming out on any rally. They thought there was more of it in Smelters live points below the previous day’s close than when the early detline started. All round the room the specialists said that shorts were still the main support and got their stock back so easily that reselling on any rally was obviously the best policy for the traders on the floor.
. The heaviest selling of National Lead, Smelters and the Copper stocks during the middle of the day apparently came through the houses ■with Western connections. The Pittsburg houses in particular were active and were also sellers of Steel preferred.
American Sugar failed altogether to recover ground lost during the day, and looked weaker at a four point decline than when the early selling started. Lower Wall Street hardly ever trades in the stock now, but people in those parts say that on general conditions they could be bullish. The inference is that large holdings are being liquidated where the market will take them.
Chishoirr. A Chapman, C. I. Hudson & Co. and other active trading houses were late buyers of U. S. Steel. A thoroughly good market for the stock was reported, but they seemed to get their stock back rather easily and were credited with covering shorts.
The most significant feature was the fact that the average price of twenty actwe railroad stocks, as kept in these columns for a quarter of a century, broke through the last low point, recorded August 25. The twelve industrial stocks are at the lowest of the year also. So far every time the previous low record had been broken, the market has recorded a further severe decline, oven where prices for a time have recovered some of the lost ground.
In spite of the heavy volume of business. Reading was the only stock which crossed the 100.000-share mark. That stock, with Union Pacific. Amalgamated Copper, and U. S. Steel, active in the order named, made up 47 per cent, of the day’s business. Activity was. however, better | distributed, ns thirteen stocks crossed the 10,000 share : mark, as against eleven on the previous day. while two 1 others approached it very closely. It is. perhaps, significant of the market movement that six of the thirteen active issues were industrials.
London will be closed to-day before our market opens, and arbitrage houses, therefore, took no position over night. In view of the character of the liquidation here, they are very certain that, with the small account open abroad, our stocks will not rally there without very definite initiative from this side.
