MARKET DIARY

By Victor J. Hillery
After sloughing off early weakness, the stock market staged a broad-based rally late yesterday with the focus on takeover issues. Trading was moderately active.
Analysts said the upswing was helped by cuts in the prime, or base, lending rates to 15%% from 16% by Continental Illinois National Bank and Crocker Bank, although other short-term interest rates rose.
The Dow Jones industrial average, up a total of 34.15 points in the prior three sessions, fell 5.61 points by noon EST yesterday and was still off 0.6“ point at 3 p.m. But the index rebounded to finish at 888.98. up 3.04 points. The transportation indicator climbed 5.58 points to 395.19. the utility average also gained.
The advance was more apparent in the New York Stock Exchange breadth figures than in the industrial average. Almost 1.000 issues rose, overwhelming the number of losers.
“Despite the economic weakness being forecast, the economy has some positive features, including lower inflation, declining short and long-term interest rates and the outlook for moderate wage settlements," commented James H. Farrell Jr., executive vice president of Cashman, Farrell & Associates Inc., Philadelphia.
"The market looked a little tired early in the day but as interest rates continue to come down more money will roll out of the rqpney funds and into high-yielding investments." contended William A. Goldstein, executive vice president of Burton J. Vincent.

"Investors had become overly concerned about the recession and the outlook for earnings." asserted Robert Errigo, research director at Prescott, Ball & Turben. "We have become bullish on the market’s outlook for the next two to three months and expect it to react more toward interest rates than to the recession and poor earnings.” he added.
Allen Sinai, vice president and senior economist at Data Resources Inc., said that "the financial markets are beginning to see substantially lower inflation rates as a consequence of the recession.” He added that “if this prospect actually materializes over the next few months, short and longterm interest rates should fall further and the stock market will strengthen even more.”
Big Board turnover, which exceeded 10 million shares m the first hour and the final 60 minutes, totaled 47,580,000 shares for the day, up from 32.770,000 on Friday. Greater institutional activity was reflected in the 651 trades of 10,000 shares or more, up from 497 in the previous session.
Marathon Oil Slid
Among takeover issues. Marathon Oil slid 2 Vi. to 105 as the most active. Under its offer to acquire Marathon, U.S. Steel was allowed by a federal court to resume soliciting shares. But neither U.S. Steel nor Mobil. which also is attempting to acquire Marathon, will be able to buy tendered shares until five days after the judge rules on Mobil's request for an injunction to block the U.S. Steel offer Mobil, also active, rose % to 26%, U.S. Steel slipped to 29%.
Allied Corp., which said it offered 8120 a share for Marathon and still would be interested in acquiring the company if bids by U.S. Steel and Mobil fail, rose % to 47.
Other oil gamers included Superior, up 2% to 40%; Cities Service, % to 52'-l<; Getty, 1% to 69; Standard Oil (Ohio), 1% to
