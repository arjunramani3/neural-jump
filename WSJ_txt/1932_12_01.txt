Wheat and sterling: staged good rallies yesterday, and the stock market responded mildly with a minor recovery movement which carried the active stocks up as much as 3 points. Interest in the bond market was centered in Governments, which sold off at the close, after some issues *had equaled or surpassed previous highs. At the finish, the Governments were off anywhere from aS to The domestic bond list was irregular, with rails much steadier. Some foreign bonds ran up sharply. Cotton closed virtually unchanged.
The run-up in wheat followed reports from Washington that the domestic allotment plan would be Introduced at the coming session of Congress. Wheat was strong from the start, with all positions sharing in the advance. December did the best, due partly to technical conditions in the market. At the close, it was up 2 % to 2% cents.
The further recovery in sterling, which got back up to $3.23, occurred simultaneously with the receipt in Washington of the new British debt note. At yesterday’s best price, sterling ■was up about 9 cents from the low.
The firmer tond in stocks developed after the first half hour of trading. Stocks were irregularly higher at the opening, eased off to around the lows for the reaction, and then staged a slow upward movement. The day’s best prices were reached in the early afternoon, with the close not far below them. Case did the best of any active stock, bolstered by the strength In wheat. It closed at 39, up more than 3 points from the day’s low. American Tobacco B, TJnion Pacific, and Steel preferred gained 2 points or more. Among specialties. Crown Cork & Seal added to its recent upswing, with a group actively pushing the stock, and Industrial Alcohol ran up.
While war debt news continues to be the chief matter of interest in Wall Street, more attention is being paid to business figures. The index of business activity for the week ended November 26, appearing during the day, attracted a good deal of attention. Since th*3 week ended October 22, the index has been in a steady downtrend. The preliminary index for the week ended November 26 showed a gain of almost a full point over that for the week ended November 19, breaking* the reactionary movement. Those optimistically inclined, also got some comfort out of the loadings figures for individual carriers for the November 26 week.
Berlin was the feature of the foreign markets. Heavy buying in an active market carried stocks up strongly. In London, British funds rallied with sterling, while stocks were irregular. Prices were heavy on the Pans bourse.
Another Debt lieduction Move
In redeeming its remaining outstanding 6% debentures. General Motors Acceptance Corp is paring its capital down more in line with its current needs. The debentures, issued in 1927, originally totaled $50,000,000. and were sold to furnish the company with capital to meet the exigencies of the boom times in the automobile business. Now, demand for automobile financing has slumped off, in line with the reduced volume of car sales, so the corporation can move further m cutting its debt.
In paying off the debentures, too, the corporation is taking advantage of the changed conditions of the money market. The corporation probably could borrow all the money it needs, now. at 4% or less, in contrast to the 6% it i3 paying on its debentures.
The Acceptance Corp.’s strong cash position enabled it to make the retirement. Similar moves in cutting down capital have been made during the depression by other financing organ!, nations, notably Commercial Investment Trust. In other groups, the oils have been conspicuous, particularly in the past year, in cutting down their obligations. They have put themselves in a position where the equity holders will reap a much larger benefit from any sustained upturn in business than otherwise would have been the case.
Nickel Plate Outlook
In some Washington quarters, there is a fair amount of optimism over the outlook for granting of the Nickel Plate’s supplemental lo<.n request asking that it be advanced immediately funds to provide for a cash payment of 5250 on the overdue, unsecured notes.
In the first place, the I. C. C. and the R. F. C. previously have shown their willingness to cooperate with the management in attempting to stave off receivership. They released roughly $1,000,000 of the $6,800,000 loan conditionally authorized in connection with the note maturity to enable the Nickel Plate to meet October interest requirements on underlying bonds and taxes.
In addition, the Commission may be impressed with the fact that 82% of the noteholders have shown their willingness to go along with the refinancing plan. The Commission is ^antagonistic to unreasonable ’’holdouts,” and certainly wants to go as far as it can to prevent their holding up the plan.
Unquestionably, if the Commission approves the Nickel Plate’s application, deposit of notes will be stimulated. Certainly, the fact that they are depending on a contingency to get actual cash has held up some and, with the cash available, they would come in. One thing which makes the Nickel Plate situation unusual, however, is that despite all the efforts of the road and its bankers, it has been, unable to locate around 6% of the $20,000,000 principal amount of notes.
The 'Frisco Default
Default by the ’Frisco on the consolidated mortgage 6s was the first failure of the road to meet bond interest. On January 1, Interest
on the prior lien bonds comes due, and there is a varied opinion about whether the court wHl authorize a payment or not and, if so, whether the road can obtain funds.
Omission of interest on the consolidated bonds was contemplated under the ’Frisco reorganization plan, but the plan, also provided that interest certificates should be issued, on which interest was to be paid. So far, however. Interest certificates have not been issued.
Only $10,000,000 of the consolidated bonds were ever publicly sold. They were brought out at 93.3 July 1, 3931. The R. F. C. is a holder of $7,254,000 prinicpal amount of the bonds as partial security for its Ioan to 'the road of $5,190,000. Some of the bonds also arc included in collateral pledged for bank loans.
Sound Talk
Alfred E. Smith is always direct and pointed in his remarks. He never was more so than in his-refreshing comment on the 5-cent fare, in which he pointed out with perfect clarity that the nickel fare isn’t a nickel fare at all, except for transients. Everyone in the city pays indirectly for the city subsidies that enable the 5-cent fare to be retained.
The comment is pretty shattering to the political war cry hat has been constantly r«xt. rd-— ’’Preserve the 5-cent fare.” Coming from Mr. Smith it is devastating.
