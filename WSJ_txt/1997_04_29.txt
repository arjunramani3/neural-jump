NEW YORK -- The stock market's surge yesterday very nearly wiped out a month's worth of misery on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average -- fostered by an encouraging inflation report and riding a wave of gains in banking and technology stocks, including International Business Machines -- soared 179.01, its second-biggest point gain ever, just above the 173.38-point surge exactly a week earlier. But the 2.64% advance didn't even come close to cracking the top 100 gains on a percentage basis -- since point moves become less significant as the index rises -- though it was still the best since Dec. 23, 1991, when the Dow industrials surged 3% (88.10 points).
Still, some analysts cautioned that the rally might prove short-lived.
"It's a long week, and there's a lot of data between now and Friday's payrolls report," said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Zurich Kemper Securities. "By Friday, the employment-cost index will be nothing more than a memory."
The Dow industrial average finished at 6962.03, its highest since closing at 7039.37 on March 12, the day after setting its current record of 7085.16.
Yesterday's session, unlike the one a week earlier, featured impressive technical supports. It was the busiest session at the New York Stock Exchange in nearly a month: 547.6 million shares changed hands, well ahead of Monday's 402.4 million level and the best since 555.7 million shares changed hands on March 31. The breadth was encouragingly positive, with advancing issues beating decliners 2,119 to 554 on the Big Board.
Broad-market measures also rose sharply. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shot up 21.09, or 2.73%, to 794.05, its best finish since March 17. The Nasdaq Composite Index rallied 25.60, or 2.10%, to 1242.63, its sixth-best point rise.
The rally was built, in part, on strength in bank stocks, which benefited from a big drop in Treasury securities yields. Citicorp jumped 4 3/4 to 112, Chase Manhattan rose 2 3/4 to 90 1/2, J.P. Morgan climbed 2 1/2 to 100 5/8 and Bank of Boston soared 3 3/8 to 72 1/4.
Other interest-rate-sensitive issues also participated in the rally, including securities brokers, such as Merrill Lynch, which shot up 5 1/2 to 94 7/8, and Morgan Stanley, which moved ahead 4 7/8 to 62 7/8.
Blue-chip financial-services companies also moved higher, including American Express, which added 2 3/4 to 66 7/8, and Travelers Group, which gained 4 3/4 to 55, a 9.5% rise. Insurance stocks also posted big gains. Cigna shot up 6 to 152 3/8, and ITT Hartford jumped 3 1/2 to 73 1/4.
Meanwhile, tech stocks were also impressive performers, as the group's outlook improved on the hope that the interest-rate backdrop would remain accommodating and not squeeze corporate margins through the rest of the year.
IBM shot ahead 8 to 158 3/8 -- adding about 25 points to the Dow industrials' gain on its own -- while Dell Computer (Nasdaq) rose 3 13/16 to 82 3/4, and Compaq scored a 4 7/8-point rise to 84 1/8.
Chip makers, led by Intel's (Nasdaq) 3 3/4-point advance to 150, moved higher. SGS-Thomson Microelectronics rose 6 to 74 3/8, and Motorola gained 1 1/2 to 56 7/8.
The techs and financials are "the locomotives of this rally," said Rick Holway, senior vice president and director of trading at Investment Advisers Inc. in Minneapolis. "When they're in gear, the market is moving."
Transportation stocks, which moved up Monday on encouraging earnings performances, continued to gain. AMR rose 3 3/8 to 93 5/8, while Delta Air Lines advanced 3 5/8 to 93 3/8. The Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 37.30, or 1.47%, to 2569.15.
Shares of PepsiCo gained 3 1/8 to 34 3/8. The beverage maker reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit.
Humana advanced 1 1/4 to 21 1/2. The health-maintenance organization posted first-quarter results that topped analysts' forecasts.
Network General (Nasdaq) lost 4 1/8 to 13 3/4. The networking-product maker late Monday reported first-quarter results that matched Wall Street's forecasts. An analyst at Cowen & Co. cut the firm's rating on the stock and lowered its estimate of the company's earnings for fiscal year 1998.
Shares of IBP moved higher in the session, adding 3/4 to 24 1/8, though the meat packer missed its earnings target with its first-quarter results.
Among other stocks that benefited from strong first-quarter results, shares of U S West Media Group gained 5/8 to 17, Tenneco added 1/2 to 39 3/8, Bethlehem Steel advanced 3/8 to 8 3/8 and Nokia's American depositary receipts rose 3 7/8 to 61 5/8.

ITT edged ahead 3/4 to 58 3/4. The hotel and gambling concern beat Wall Street's profit target. The company said it is in talks with a number of potential buyers for its half stake in New York television station WBIS+. Shares of Dow Jones, the other half owner, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, gained 5/8 to 40 1/4.
Boeing managed to edge higher after a big loss in Monday's session. The stock added 7/8 to 96 1/4.
Shares of Procter & Gamble extended Monday's rally, rising 3 1/8 to 127 3/4, and moved close to their two-month-old record of 129 5/8.
Walt Disney moved ahead 3 1/8 to 80 3/4, reaching a 52-week high.
Choice Hotels gained 1 3/8 to 14 1/8. The company said its board approved plans to split the company into a hotel operator and a separate hotel franchiser.
Kennametal rose 1 7/8 to 35 1/4. The maker of metalworking tools will sell as much as 20% of its new JLK Direct Distribution unit in an initial public stock offering.
EMC advanced 2 to 36. PaineWebber boosted its rating on the stock of the computer-storage-software developer.
Falcon Drilling fell 1 1/4 to 37 5/8. Salomon cut its rating on the barge-drilling contractor.
Robert Half International gained 2 1/2 to 39 1/2. Lehman Brothers initiated coverage of the temporary-services provider.
Shares of McDermott International and its 61%-owned J. Ray McDermott unit fell after trading resumed in the stocks yesterday. The issues were halted Monday, and never opened in that session, after McDermott said it expects to report a net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter of as much as $200 million and that it had begun an internal investigation into what it called allegations of wrongdoing by former employees. McDermott shares lost 2 1/4 to 18 3/4, while J. Ray McDermott dropped 4 7/8 to 17 5/8.
The Dow industrials narrowly missed topping their biggest point gain ever: the 186.84-point advance on Oct. 21, 1987, two days after the Black Monday market crash. On a percentage basis, however, the 2.64% advance by the Dow industrials doesn't compare with the 10.15% rise on that day.
