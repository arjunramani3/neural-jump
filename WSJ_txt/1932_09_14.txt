Sharp declines in the commodity markets brought about a severe reaction in stock prices yesterday, the decline growing in intensity in the final Quarter hour of trading. Bonds, which were generally higher through the morning, lost ground late in the* session, the more speculative railroad issues and industrial bonds suffering the most. Wheat lost around 2 cents h bushel, and cotton, at the close, was down $1 a bale. Both wheat and cotton had ruled higher throughout the morning, cotton at one time showing a gain of around $1.25 a bale.
The stock market covered a lot of territory during the day. At the opening, stocks were irregular, with changes in the pivotal issues mostly Small. Trading was in reduced volume, but the market pushed forward steadily through the morning hours. American Telephone at one time was up more than 2 points from the opening, touching 114%; Ajperican Can and Allied Chemical, at their best prices, were up around a point from the start, and gains in some stocks, like Union Pacific, amounted to around three points.
The break in commodity prices, which got under way in tbe early afternoon, put a damper on speculative enthusiasm for stocks. The earlier advances were soon wiped out, and in the late traeiing declines were drastic. American Telephone closed at 108 %, off more than six points from the high and around four points on the day; Union Pacific was down seven points from its best price; Westinghouse more than six, and declines elsewhere were pronounced. Volume picked up swiftly on the sell-off, and the tape lagged behind.
been undertaken by utility companies, and by units in the industry who found themselves in a weak position.
Tbe major refinancing problems over the near future will be those of the railroads. Those undertaken so far have been put through with government aid largely on the basis that any-, thing is better than receivership. Tbe railroads will find the refinancing price high.
.	. Bank Credit and Stock Selling	-
One factor that has made for better markets in the past few weeks is that the banks have taken a more liberal attitude toward extending credit to Individuals on collateral. In the late phases of the spring decline, individuals pressed for cash found difficulty in obtaining loans. Forced to sell stocks to raise cash, they disposed of those with a ready market. Selling of this type was responsible, in part, for tbe acute weakness in the highest grade stocks in the late spring.	-	‘
With the change in the banking situation, selling of this type has dried up. Banks, during the recent rally, were able to liquidate weak loans, but this was accomplished on a rising market, and did not have the adverse effects of similar liquidation in the weak markets of the spring.

Harvester and Case Break Severely
Stacks which moved closely in line with movements of commodity prices were tbe major sufferers. International Harvester broke abruptly, losing over five points on the day; J. I. Case was down more than eight, and Sears Roebuck, three. Steel common, which got up to 44 % during the period of strength, closed at 39%, off about 13 points from its recent rally top. U. S. Steel preferred closed just under 80, off 1% points on the day.
Tbe day’s routine business news was of mixed character, Pennsylvania’s loadings for the September 10 week, which Included Labor Day. declined less from the like 1931 week than did the loadings for the preceding week. Electric output figures also were better from the point of view of percentage decline.	.
Youngstown district steel operations at the midweek sagged to 18% of capacity from 21% at the start of the week. Seventeen of 83 open hearth furnaces are operating, two less than at the week’s start. Copper prices abroad were slightly weaker. Governor Roosevelt's speech in Topeka hardly was an important influence marketwise.	"
London and Paris Markets Strong
The markets abroad were generally higher. In London the oil stocks were particularly strong in a firm market. In Paris trading was active and stocks rose.
At yesterday’s close, the Dow-Jones average of 30 industrial Btocks was down to 65.88, off 14.05 points from the high set September 7. At tbe closer'the average had lost 36.3% of the ground gained in the advance from July 8 low of 41.22. The Dow-Jones rail average, at 29.71, was off 2.86 points on the day and 9.56 points from the high reached September 3, the decline has amounted to 36.3% of the ground covered in the advance between tbe July 8 low and tbe September 3 high.
Insull Utilities Report
The report of the auditors on Insull Utility Investments, Inc., will furnish any amount of ammunition for the agitators for increased regulation of companies connected with the utility field. The huge deficit revealed is one matter, but the charges of auditors in regard to the annual reports, particularly the income accounts, are far more serious.
The reports of tbe companies for 1930 and 1931 showed substantial income. Net income for 1930 was put at $10,343,072, and for 1931 at $5,240,540. Included in tbe gross income of the corporation were Btock dividends, taken in at market value at the. date of receipt. In 1930, these stock dividends amounted to close to one-third of the company's gross income, and in 1931 to slightly more than 40%. A more general, and what is regarded as a far more conservative practice, is to include stock dividends in income „on the basis of the amount at which they are charged on the books of the company which pays them.
In the auditor’s report are items of great dramatic interest. The purchase of big blocks of Peoples Gas. Chicago Electric Illuminating Co. and Public Service of Northern Illinois by one of the Insull companies from Cyrus Eaton, at prices sharply above prevailing market figures, marked the end of a battle for control. It was*a personal battle, and stockholders in the Insull holding companies had very little knowledge of what was going on.
Insull Utility Investments was not an operating utility company and its stock was not listed on the "Big Board.” Its history indicates it was a one-man show, although it had a board of directors.
Refinancing Operations Costly
For several companies, refinancing operations, undertaken recently, have proved costly, and axe bound to be reflected in the earnings available for equities. In some Instances, companies have been forced to sell bonds, bearing anywhere from a fr%% to 7% coupon, to replace bonds which bore only a 4% or a 5% coupon. An Increase of 2% in bond Interest charges makes a big change in the picture for companies where the equity 1s thin.
So far, tbe bulk of tbe new financing has
