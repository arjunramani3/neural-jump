The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which leapt 402.63 points on Thursday of last week but was down for that week overall, finished up 2.62%, or 257.59 points, at 10102.74. That was its first close above 10000 since March 15, putting an end to the blue-chip average's longest period below 10000 since it first crossed that milestone on March 29, 1999, more than two years ago. The initial close above 10000 touched off a wild celebration featuring "Dow 10000" baseball caps on the New York Stock Exchange floor.
Overall, the market value of U.S. stocks has risen 6% on paper, or about $730 billion, to about $12.31 trillion, since its low of about $11.58 trillion on Wednesday of last week, based on the market value of the companies in the Wilshire 5000 index. That includes the gain for investors yesterday of about $334.54 billion, or 2.79%. The Wilshire stocks' market value still is down 27%, or $4.65 trillion, since peaking at about $16.96 trillion on March 24, 2000.The Wilshire 5000 includes about 7,000 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company with headquarters in the U.S.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.82%, or 1.12 points, to 137.68.

After months of pain, investors treated themselves to their second full-scale buying binge in the past four sessions, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a close above the 10000 level again for the first time in nearly a month.
Money flowed out of bonds and into stocks, and falling bond prices pushed up the yield of the 10-year Treasury note back above 5%.
Some of the day's biggest news came after the close of regular-hours trading, when mobile-phone maker Motorola announced a sharper-than-expected first-quarter loss, based on worse-than-expected margins. One test of the current rebound's resiliency will be how sharply technology stocks react to the bad Motorola news. Motorola shares fell 7% in after-hours trading.
There wasn't a single catalyst for the day's sharp stock gains. But traders said a variety of factors, including the possibility of a tax cut and upbeat comments from a succession of Federal Reserve officials, have spurred hopes for an end to the economic slowdown and the corporate earnings slump. No one can be sure that the economy is getting ready to improve, of course, but some investors are betting the market has to "bottom" sometime and that this could be it.
"I feel more confident that things could be better from here on out -- for a while anyway," said Larry Lawler, head of stock trading at New York mutual-fund group Dreyfus Corp. "This could be the beginning of a decent rally."
The Nasdaq Composite Index and its lineup of major technology stocks soared 6.09%, or 106.32 points, to 1852.03. That was the index's 13th sharpest one-day percentage gain since it was created in 1971; it came just three trading days after the index's third biggest gain, 8.92%, which it racked up on Thursday of last week. The surge left the index up 13% in the four trading days since it closed at 1638.80 on Wednesday.
Of course, the Nasdaq index remains down 25% so far this year, after a 39% drop last year. Some investors said it was the simple magnitude of the losses since the index began falling in March of last year that began to persuade some investors that most of the bad news must be factored into stock prices.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which leapt 402.63 points on Thursday of last week but was down for that week overall, finished up 2.62%, or 257.59 points, at 10102.74. That was its first close above 10000 since March 15, putting an end to the blue-chip average's longest period below 10000 since it first crossed that milestone on March 29, 1999, more than two years ago. The initial close above 10000 touched off a wild celebration featuring "Dow 10000" baseball caps on the New York Stock Exchange floor.
The Dow industrials still are down 6% so far this year, following a 6% drop for all of last year.
Investors were particularly heartened yesterday that the gains came on heavy trading volume. Many traders said they saw real investors moving money from cash and bonds back into stocks. But they added that, with the majority of companies scheduled to report first-quarter earnings in the next three weeks, the ability of U.S. stocks to continue their rise will depend on how much "visibility" companies can offer of their likely performance in the second half of this year.
Stocks are likely to move in a "sawtooth pattern, two steps forward, one step back," said James Weiss, chief investment officer for stocks at Boston mutual-fund group State Street Research. But he said that, unlike previous rallies over the past year, which were wiped out by later selling, "it could be lasting in the sense that the market here is in the process of building a bottom." All the same, he added, "We have to remind ourselves that we still have 75% of the earnings-reporting season to plow through."
The decline in Treasury bonds came as investors moved money away from the bonds' relative safety and back to stocks. The 10-year Treasury note fell 1 9/32, or $12.8125 for each $1,000 invested, its biggest drop since Jan. 3. The yield, which moves inversely to the bond's price, rose to 5.081%. The bond had most recently been above 5% on March 29.
Recent economic data released "don't show Armageddon, and with expectations of an improving economy you shouldn't anticipate" a big rate cut before the Fed's policy meeting next month, said Chris Fitzmaurice, a senior government-bond trader at Salomon Smith Barney. And economic recovery is better for stocks than for bonds. "If the stock market has it right, the bond market has it wrong, and you have to be a seller of bonds," he said.
The dollar was mixed.

Nasdaq Surges 6% as Investors Grow Confident - ProQuest
Many investors and traders remain skeptical of the stock market's recent surge, and some are expecting it to pull back and "retest" its recent lows.
"We did see a lot of institutional buying in technology and financials," said Patrick Boyle, a block trader at Credit Suisse First Boston. "But I think it was more that people were afraid to miss another bounce, and not jumping in with both feet."
Professional investors still are keeping a lot of money in cash on the sidelines, holding it out of stocks until they are persuaded that the recent gains are for real. "I don't think there was a lot of conviction behind this rally. People bought it but didn't believe it," Mr. Boyle said.
The stock gains came despite Friday's uptick in the unemployment rate, which sparked recession fears and helped send stocks down sharply that day. Since then, however, a number of Fed officials have made public statements suggesting that the economy could be on the mend. Upbeat economic remarks yesterday came from St. Louis Fed President William Poole and Atlanta Fed President Jack Guynn.
Investors also mentioned growing hopes for a tax cut, as well as a few recent corporate announcements, from such disparate companies as Alcoa and Amazon.com, that first quarter performance was better than expected.
Mr. Weiss said U.S. stocks also were helped by recent reports of declining inventories, because excess inventories had been blamed for some of the corporate sales slowdown.
And people were glad to see recent interest-rate cuts at foreign central banks, which created hopes for more such cuts. That kind of optimism, particularly with regard to the European Central Bank, helped propel European stocks ahead yesterday. The Dow Jones Stoxx 50 index of the 50 largest European stocks put in its second-best point and percentage gains of the year, rising 2.9%, or 116.99 points, to 4141.14. It is up 11% since March 22, although it still is down 8% since this year began.
Mr. Lawler said he is seeing signs that U.S. fund managers are beginning to hope, at least, for an improvement in market conditions.
"Money managers have more confidence that these companies are going to start to give us better guidance going forward, and that we are going to have a better idea of where they are coming from and where they are going. That is especially true in the tech area," he said. "People are a little more confident that corporate earnings will be better down the road. People are starting to feel better about the fundamentals."
All the same, some of the best performing stocks so far this year, such as Advanced Micro Devices and Dell Computer, still are well off their record highs. AMD, in fact, has fallen sharply from this year's highs, although it remains well up from the end of last year.
Overall, the market value of U.S. stocks has risen 6% on paper, or about $730 billion, to about $12.31 trillion, since its low of about $11.58 trillion on Wednesday of last week, based on the market value of the companies in the Wilshire 5000 index. That includes the gain for investors yesterday of about $334.54 billion, or 2.79%. The Wilshire stocks' market value still is down 27%, or $4.65 trillion, since peaking at about $16.96 trillion on March 24, 2000.The Wilshire 5000 includes about 7,000 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company with headquarters in the U.S.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.82%, or 1.12 points, to 137.68.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 2,084 stocks rose and 1,006 fell.
Bonds declined. In addition to the 10-year note's decline, the 30-year bond fell 2 to yield 5.631%.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 88.81 cents to the euro and 124.37 yen, strengthening from 89.66 cents and weakening from 125.04 yen.
