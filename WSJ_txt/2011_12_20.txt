NEW YORK--U.S. stocks rallied as domestic home building jumped to the highest level in nearly two years and another successful Spanish debt auction buoyed investor sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 337.17 points, or 2.87%, to close at 12103.43, pushing the blue-chip index back above 12000 and putting it into positive territory for the month.
The rally comes after the blue-chip Dow dropped 100 points on Monday and closed at the lowest level of the month.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 36 points, or 3%, to 1241. All 10 of the S&P 500's sectors rose, led higher by financial, material and energy stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 78 points, or 3.1%, to 2601.
Trading volume was light as many investors are closing their books prior to year-end and ahead of the holidays.
"Sentiment has been awful and volumes are thin," said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust. "Any good news can push stocks up pretty quickly in this kind of environment."
J.P. Morgan Chase led the Dow higher, rising 5.1%. Walt Disney rose 4.4% and Caterpillar tacked on 4.3%. Bank of America gained 3.7% and moved back above the key $5 level.
The market got a boost following a better-than-expected report on the housing sector. U.S. housing starts surged 9.3% in November, rising to the highest level in 19 months. Construction permits also grew. Both are encouraging signs for the housing market, which has struggled for years.
"Over the last two weeks, the big concern has been Europe," said Hank Smith, chief investment officer of equities at Haverford Investments. "But last week's jobless claims and this week's housing starts were both pretty good. If Europe's in a recession, it doesn't appear to be impacting us yet."
Stocks of home builders and apartment operators gained following the data. Beazer jumped 13%, Lennar rose 6.3% and Home Properties advanced 3.4%.
European markets rose, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 2%, after better-than-expected data out of Germany. The Ifo Institute's closely-watched business confidence index rose in December and exceeded analysts' projections.
Separately, Spain sold [euro]5.64 billion ($7.33 billion) of short-term Treasury bills, exceeding the target of [euro]4.5 billion. The average yields fell sharply from the previous auction of bills in November. Last week, Spain sold nearly double the amount of longer-term bonds than it had targeted.
Still, market participants suggest stocks are still range-bound and the S&P 500 would need to jump above 1260 for investors to build conviction in a potential rally.
"I'm having trouble believing the market is turning a major corner here," said Christian Thwaites, president of Sentinel Asset Management. "I don't think this is anything more substantive than the alternating risk-on, risk-off strategy we've seen in recent weeks."
Asian bourses bounced, with South Korea's Kospi rising 0.9%, after sliding 3.4% on Monday, and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average tacking on 0.3%. Worries about the implications of the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il receded.
Shares of AT&T added 1.3% after the blue chip telecommunications company withdrew its $39 billion bid for T-Mobile USA. AT&T said it would pay $3 billion in cash and turn over some of its wireless spectrum to T-Mobile's owner, Deutsche Telekom, for failing to complete the deal, first announced in March.
Meanwhile, Sprint Nextel gained 8.3%. The stock had dropped 14% on March 21 after AT&T's bid to buy T-Mobile was announced. It has lost more than half its value since the bid was unveiled.
Jefferies shares leapt 21% after the investment bank's quarterly results beat analysts' estimates. The company also reduced its balance sheet by nearly one-fourth and cut its leverage. The company has been under stress amid worries about its exposure to European sovereign debt.
General Mills slipped 1.1% after the packaged-food company reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations. ConAgra also reported a double-digit percentage drop in its fiscal second-quarter earnings, but results beat expectations and its shares rose 4.1%. Both companies are banking on earnings growth picking up in the second half of their fiscal years.
Navistar gained 7.3% after the commercial and military truck maker's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings were well above forecasts as margins widened.

Red Hat slid 8.6% after the software provider reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that topped analyst forecasts, but disappointed investors by only matching revenue
estimates. The stock had hit a 10-year high at the end of November.
Oracle, which is slated to report fiscal second-quarter results after the close, gained 1.9%.
