The Fed's five interest-rate cuts this year, together with the recent economic numbers, have made many people start to think that "we have been through the worst," and that the U.S. economy will escape recession, Mr. [Bob Bissell] said. But like many in his business, he said he remains skeptical that stock-market gains will be more than gradual, and he still expects bonds to do better than stocks.
Overall, the market value of U.S. stocks now has gained back $2 trillion since hitting a low of $11.58 trillion on April 4, based on the market value of the companies in the Wilshire 5000 index. The Wilshire's market value stood yesterday at about $13.61 trillion, after a gain for investors of about $361.55 billion, or 2.73%. The Wilshire's overall market value still is down $3.35 trillion from its high of $16.96 trillion on March 24, 2000.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.14%, or 0.20 point, to 143.71.

In one of Wall Street's biggest rallies of the year, U.S. investors jumped into stocks, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 11000 again for the first time since September.
The rally followed the curious day-earlier action in which investors had seemed to shrug their shoulders at initial news of the Federal Reserve's fifth interest-rate cut of the year, leaving stocks little changed on a day when the bullish Fed announcement should seemingly have had a bigger effect.
"One day it doesn't matter, the next day we're off to the races," noted Bob Bissell, president of Wells Capital Management, Wells Fargo's money-management arm.
After taking a night to reconsider, investors and traders apparently decided yesterday that the U.S. economic prospects are better than they had thought.
Trading volume turned heavier again after two lackluster weeks, with the biggest gains in technology and industrial stocks that would benefit from an uptick in the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 3.15%, or 342.95 points, to 11215.92. That put it up 4% so far this year, just 4% off its record close of 11722.98, which dates from Jan. 14, 2000.
The point gain was the fifth biggest ever for the blue-chip barometer, though on a percentage basis -- which is more important from a practical standpoint -- the rise isn't among history's largest. Still, it was the industrial average's third-strongest percentage rally so far this year.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 3.88%, or 80.86 points, at 2166.44. Despite putting in a 32% gain since April 4, the Nasdaq index, dominated by beleaguered technology stocks, still is down 12% so far this year.
Unlike the industrials, which are far less exposed to the volatile tech sector, the Nasdaq index is 57% off its record close of 5048.62, set on March 10, 2000.
Some of the buying came from previously skeptical professional investors who have been holding money out of the stock market. Some of them appear to have decided, after a night's reflection, to take a part of the money they are holding on the sidelines and put it back into stocks, said Mr. Bissell and other market participants.
"A lot of portfolio managers aren't going to make a directional move until they have sat down the next morning and taken a level-headed look at what is going on in the marketplace," said John O'Donoghue co-head of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. Yesterday morning, he said, many appeared to decide to do a little buying.
Once the indexes started moving strongly, Mr. Bissell and Mr. O'Donoghue added, a "short-covering rally" ensued. This came as short-sellers -- who sell borrowed stock, betting on a decline -- began buying to cover their positions, removing the selling pressure, reinforcing the buy orders and accelerating the gains.
The Fed's five interest-rate cuts this year, together with the recent economic numbers, have made many people start to think that "we have been through the worst," and that the U.S. economy will escape recession, Mr. Bissell said. But like many in his business, he said he remains skeptical that stock-market gains will be more than gradual, and he still expects bonds to do better than stocks.
The buying seemed to be fueled by investors who have decided "that maybe the end of this horrible period is upon us and maybe we are in the bottoming stages of this cycle," said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, the money-management arm of State Street Corp. in Boston. A clear indication of that view could be found in the big gains of the old-style industrial stocks, which would benefit from a strong upturn, Mr. Riley said. Like Mr. Bissell, he said he finds that hope "a
little premature."
Nevertheless, the stock moves were startling. Among the Dow industrials, aluminum maker Alcoa was up 6% and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing rose 7%, both finishing at or close to record highs. 3M was the biggest point and percentage gainer in the industrial average. American Express also was up 6%. Just one of the 30 Dow industrials components fell, Wal-Mart Stores, whose quarterly earnings, announced Tuesday, didn't impress investors.

Stocks Surge as Investors Digest Fed Rate Cut --- Industrials Surge 3.15%, Surpassing 11000 Level As Nasdaq Rises 3.88% - ProQuest
Some of the biggest gainers were technology stocks outside the Dow industrials. Cisco Systems was up 6.7%, Qualcomm was up 8.8% and CMGI, a concern that develops Internet companies, was up 10.8%.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also rose, gaining 2.85%, or 35.55 points, to 1284.99.
Investors were influenced by two bits of favorable economic news. The consumer-price index rose slightly less than expected in April, and April housing starts were slightly stronger than expected. That reinforced hopes that inflation will remain tame, permitting the Fed to continue cutting interest rates and stimulating the economy, and that the economy has enough resilience to avoid a recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of declines).
"I think the market needed a second piece of good news, in the form of lower inflation numbers, which still are the stock market's best friend," said David Sowerby, portfolio manager at money-management group Loomis Sayles in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. "When inflation rates are less than 4% [as they are now], stocks compound historically at about a 15.5% rate, and that is very positive."
Bonds rose on the favorable inflation news. The dollar declined against the euro and rose against the yen.
Overall, the market value of U.S. stocks now has gained back $2 trillion since hitting a low of $11.58 trillion on April 4, based on the market value of the companies in the Wilshire 5000 index. The Wilshire's market value stood yesterday at about $13.61 trillion, after a gain for investors of about $361.55 billion, or 2.73%. The Wilshire's overall market value still is down $3.35 trillion from its high of $16.96 trillion on March 24, 2000.
The Wilshire 5000 includes about 7,200 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company with headquarters in the U.S.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.14%, or 0.20 point, to 143.71.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.31 billion shares traded, 2,153 stocks rose and just 940 fell.
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32. The yield, which moves inversely to the bond's price, fell to 5.458%. The 30-year bond was up 15/32 to yield 5.856%.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 88.33 cents to the euro and 123.60 yen, weakening from 87.88 cents and strengthening from 123.48 yen.
