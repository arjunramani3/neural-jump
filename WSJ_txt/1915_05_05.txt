THE STOCK MARKET
A GENERAL DECLINE
Standard issues failed to respond to early strengrtli in specialties and general list declined sharply after midday.
Sales 895.+3S shares
While increasing complications in international pol-iiics were the cause to which a sharp break in security prices was commonly ascribed* the probability is that th? chief reason for the decline was to be found in the condition of the market itself. For weeks stocks had pursued a steadily advancing course until the upward movement was checked about April 29, since when there has been heavy liquidation resulting in the transfer of holdings from strong to weaker hand*. The liquidation increased the floating supply of stock in the Street, but bullish activity in certain specialties served in some measure to conceal the nature of the operations going on in the general list. The more experienced traders turned to the hear* side; but a great many others continued to buy stocks, and many of. these resorted to the familiar device of the stop order as a means of limiting their losses jo the event of a sudden decline. So many of these stop orders were placer somewhat under the level of prices prevailing? when the bullish commitments were entered into, that the market became fairly honeycombed with them, and they formed a serious element of weakness. This condition would probably have caused a decline even in the absence of such news as that of the strained relations between Japan and China, although this may have accelerated the downward movement, just as the Gulfiight incident had given the first impulse to it earlier in the week. That the decline was nothing more than a normal reaction, tending to make healthier condition in the market, was the belief of prominent interests, who thought that one effect might be to direct speculation from the specialties, in which too large a proportion of it has heretofore been concentrated, into the standard issues, in which it could bo conducted with greater safety.
Reports from the sttel trade were faxo:able indicating: a .substantial improvement in that line of industry: red the increased <ttength of the London copper Tret.il market. combined with evidence of a good demand for tno copper tstocks on the decline, was regarded a« significant. Highlv faxniable conditions for the groxv.ne cion-were indicated m the weeklv xxcathci tepoit; and the Onn state bulletin «hoxxed a condition of 94 for xvintc’* xx heat .n tnat **ate. compared xxith 88 at tho beginning of Ap'i* A ri*e in the Westinghouse convertible debcntuics wa« explained by the announcement that the compr.nv intone'* to offer new bond* in exchange, in which the eonveitibio feature mav be of value. but which xxul give the co-rpany facilities not noxv posse*-ed for raising ifcxx capital in the event that the inerca-e or bu-i”e£s make* that ne^s-arx. A side.tght on the prosperitv in the copper trade was attended bv the declaration of_a dividend of SI." a «ha:e ny Calumet £• Hcr’a. compared with §5 a share three month.- ago. and no dividends in the two preceding quartets.

T'-ansactions totaled 895.090 «ha-cs. and at the end decline* were gene-a I. the losses amounting to two or three points in many c..ses.
Dull and Vnin1<’re*4iit;r
Tne opening was a comnarstively quiet affair, but stocks in general showed gain* of a fraction on Tuesday’s reactionary close. Attendance in the conrni**iot. houses was lighter than for some time past, and there xxerc indications that the holding* of many small speculators had recently been «hakc»n out.
United State*- Steel opened % up at 58%. xvnilc Amalgamated Copper gamed % nr. its first sale and ir.eiea^ed its advance to on the taext few transactions Locomotive opened Vi up. while Pressed Steel Car gained a point on
the first sale, which was at 50. People who have been well informed on the affairs of the latter company said a contract had been signed securing the largest order for cars that concern has ever received. In Union Pacific there was an initial gain of %, while Reading opened % off at 148%.	•
Studebaker showed a tendency to recover from Tuesday afternoon’.s decline, the first sale being % up, at 74^4. It was argued that the stock would now begin to receive attention from investors on account of its 5*~c dividend. Westinghouse gained IVh by opening at 102’A-
Favonible News	‘
Trading in the first half hour was comparatively quiet, but prices gained steadily until the leaders scored advances of about a point on Tuesday's close. At the higher level, however, stock was supplied in some auantity, and at 1CD30 prices were a shade off, but the undertone seemed to be firm.
Two items in the morning's news attracted favorable attention, one being the excess of $23,326,000 of exports over imports for the week ended May 1, a gain of $2,600.000, compared with the previous week, and of $11,000,000 over two weeks before. For the five months* period from December 1 to May 1 the excess of exports over imports has amounted to $704,000,000, which in normal times would be considered very’ large for a whole year. The other favorable item was published by Dow, Jones & Co. telling of sales of pig iron at Birmingham, for the last half of the year, at $10 a ton. It is only a short time since the market there wm unsteady at $9.25.
Kansas City Southern was a notably strong feature of the railroad list, advancing 1% to 28®>r. There is a bullish sentiment on the north and south roads, on account I of the prospective development of their business, as a -result of the opening of the Panama Canal, and in Kansas J City Southern’s territory, as in the whole Southwest, the i crop outlook is fine.	j

The action of the market in the first hour was per- f fectly natural, although it did not suit those who wanted i a big advance any more than it satisfied those who would like to see a heavy decline. It snowed an inclination to mark time, and nothing better could ..avc been expected. The fluctuations were sufficiently wide to afford opportunities for trading; but there xvas nothing to indicate a definite tendentv. although stocks met support a little above the lowest levels of Tuesda.x.
The copper issues showed a considerable degree of strength m response »o the higher level of quotations for t'e meta' in' London, that market being stronger than for several tax* past.
The Gulflight matter seemed for the time being to be ox’ershadoxxed by the trouble between .Japan and China, and J the prospect of the delivery of an ultimatum by the former ■ to the latter nation. The traders said the United States j would b<t>>iiie inxolxtu; bjl -u far this countrv has adhered * to a peaceful cour-o. no: only in the Far East but else- , where, under trying c.rcum>tancc=.	I
Ki*»e in Virginia-Carolina	;
There xxcrc sharp advances in a number of the spe- : cialties in the second hour, but the general list did not 1 tespond. and th'.*’ fact encouraged the bears to make a new attack at midday, a* a result of which the leading . stocks fell to the lowest prices since the opening. X ery , few experienced traders expected an immediate resumption of the upward movement.	I
Virginia-Carolina Chemical was one of the stocks t which scored a large advance. The trading in that issue , vas unusually active, and the pr’ce ro*e 3 points to 37., after having made a net advance of 2 3* on Tuesday. It! v a* reported that Chicago capitalists interested in another, department of the fertihrer industry were buying Virginia-Carolina Chemical for control.
There was considerable selling of Steel a* a result of the definite denial published by !»oxx. Jones & Co. of the rumor of a very large orde** from Russia for rails. • Shortly after twelve o'clock 4/H‘O shares were sold in .x block at 58. that being only % above Tuesday's lowest. On Reading also there xxas rather heavy selling pressure. • Bethlehem Steel responded to the statement published bx Doxx, Jones & Co. to the effort that the company is understood to have received an additional war order amounting to $83,0CThe stock gained 9 points by selling at 344.	i
Decline in Keadinjr	j
The report from Pekin that China wa« apprehensive ef an immediate commencement of hostilities by Japan xxa-' seized upon a* a pretext for a renexxed selling moxc-n»ent in the eaiJv afternoon, and prices went off rather, easily. Traders *aid the market wa* full of stop order*, i rr.d they started out in search of them. sell.ng pretty free- ' ly all through the active l:«t.
A rather surprising development xxas a sharp adx’ance in the Westinghouse convertible* coincidently with a declining movement »n the stock. The bond*, advanced 5 point*- to 10-P4. although the convertibility i* not a matter <f much value at th*» present time, as the conversion point is 200.
In connection xxith the decline in Reading the theory was offered that New York Central ha* been *clhng th*' interest in the company xx'nich it obtained xxhen it absorbed the Lake Shore. It xxas argue J that thi* vxould ho the readiest way in which Central could obtain a supply of funds after’ having sold «10<».000.000 bonds on a basis meaning considerably more than G''< as the cost of the nexx- capital.	.
The pressure on Steel was hcavx. 5.000 shares being sold m a block at 37% compared with a low of 37% on Tuesday.
