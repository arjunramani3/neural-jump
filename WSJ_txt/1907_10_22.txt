scale down. This was among the best support given at the time when the stock needed all it could get
The advance in call money to 70 per cent, caused some out-of-town selling, as sensational money rates always seem to appeal to the customers of the wire houses.
Owing to the similarity of names, itThky be as well to State that the firm of Chas. D. Barney & Co. of No. 25 Broad -Street, has no connection with Charles T. Barney, the ex-president of the Knickerbocker Trust Co. Chas. D. Barney, formerly the head of Chas. D. Barney & Co., is the son-in-law of Jay Cooke, of th^ famous firm of Jay Cooke & Co., and is not related in any way to Charles T. Barney of the Knickerbocker Trust Co.
_ In the loan crowd the general rate was 6 per cent., with a very strong demand for stocks. Steel preferred, New York Central, and Pennsylvania were all in demand flat, while Reading, Steel common, and Union Pacific were wanted well under the general rate. There is evidently still a large uncovered short interest.
FEATURES OF THE MARKET.
A MOST SEVERE DECLINE BUT NO PANIC.
Stocks Break Badly on Knickerbocker Trust Company Suspension—Call Money Touches 70e/c—Morgan Interests Give Invaluable Support—One Stock Exchange Failure—Some Rallu at the Close.
At the opening the market was sharply influenced by the severe preliminary decline in London. Reading lost over four points in the first few sales, and Union Pacific nearly as much. Powerful and well organized support appeared and the market rallied somewhat, although severe weakness developed after midday. The market never got out of hand, but the declines in active issues like Union Pacific at one time extended to over eight points and losses in proportion were seen elsewhere. The run on the Knickerbocker Trust Co. began with the opening of the market, and the suspension of that institution was coincident with the sharpest break of the day. Call money rar. up rapidly and in the early afternoon was 70%- bid, easing slightly before the close. Some improvement was shown ir the market when the promise of Treasury assistance to th: banks was made known, and the support from the Morgai interests, evidently in charge of that end of the day’.*-business, was simply magnificent. Other interests wh. have not hesitated to profit by Wall Street’s distress wher they themselves have not suffered in the past were conspicuous only by their absence. It is needless to specify the particular groups of operators, but the natural infer ence drawn is that they have had all they could do to tak* care of themselves. The worst and most dangerous feat ure in the view of Wall Street was the alarm among th. public. The frightened depositor is a proposition Nev York has not had to handle in recent times and assurance which would satisfy the Street and its experienced leaders might be meaningless to the sort of crowd which gatherer outside 66 Broadway at the opening of business in th: morning. In these circumstances there is nothing to b< done but point to the very fair rally in the last half hou as an example that natural forces are at work to restor. confidence.
-Among the railroad stocks Delaware & Hudson Ins 9 points, Northern Pacific 6. Reading, Union Pacific. St Paul, and less active issues 5, and practically everythin; else from 2 to 4 points. There were no advances on th day, hut the elose was at least two points above the lowest
The industrials were all very much depressed, but upon the whole, were not so hard hit as the leading rail road stocks. Declines there, however, extended from 1 t. 3 .points. The tractions were weak.
While the financial situation Obviously caused great anxiety the direct and concentrated attack upon Readinr and Union Pacific*, the market leaders indicated that th; bear party was doing all it could to stimulate liquidation It was in these stocks the most powerful of the support was placed.
Vigorous attack was made upon Amalgamated Copper at the opening. Floor traders thought the support then surprisingly good. The stoq^ seems to have been sold to a standstill recently and even now traders consider that it i> by no means so plentiful as the loan crowd would indicate This is probably because it was the first stock thrown out of loans and has been to some extent absorbed.
H. B. Hollins & Co., who were giving out reassuring information, were themselves tho heaviest buyers of Union Pacific in the first half hour, taking 1(1,000 shares or mort and absorbing probably all the sales of that stock foj foreign account. In view of the affiliations of the hous« traders consider this to be Morgan support and traced buying orders from the same interest elsewhere.
It is estimated that H. B. Hollins & Co., who were the largest buyers of Union Pacific, took at least 50,000 shares of various stocks round the room. This is generally considered to have lieen for J. T. Morgan & Co. and thei: associates, and is taken as an indication that the situation Is well in hand.
The almost impossible market for specialties was-shown in the sale of 100 shares of Lackawanna at 425, the low point of the year, and u concession of ten points from the last previous sale. There is, however, less stock of this character offering now than there was at the end of last week.
shares ot
A Eckstein, the specialist, was thought to have sold about 25.0(10 shares of Smelters. He was reported to have sold a corresponding amount on Monday’s rally and was a seller of at least 50,000 shares at the end of last week. This was considered straight liquidation and is said to come from, a source close to the Guggenheim interest.
Houses recently identified with operations on the bear side were not following the market down. J. R. Williston & Co. were substantial buyers of Amalgamated Copper and Reading. F. W. Savin & Co. gave valuable support to Northern Pacific, and H. N. Whitney & Co. were thought to be covering shorts when they bought 10,000 * Smelters.	*
A good many houses were refusing to sell customers for reasons obvious enough, but there short selling. Among other stocks New York Central was under pressure apparently from the New street bear contingent which has followed the market down throughout the long decline.
The specialists were far -too busy to talk about conditions on the floor, and those in Union Pacific were fairly carried off their feet. It was difficult to analyze the character of the selling and several times there wps a difference of a point between the prices on either side of the crowd.
short for was some
London was a seller of about fifty thousand shares, which is nearly what was bought for foreign account on Monday, or perhaps a little less. The Monday purchases probably represented the covering of shorts, while these sales are more likely to indicate long stock sold for New York in London before our opening coming back here.
The London sales were largely in Steels, but also in considerable quantity in Union Pacific, Reading and the really active internationals, of which the number at present is probably considerably less than a dozen. Foreign ' houses were not alarmed at the London selling, and reported that the liquidation in that market for the continent was quite small, indicating that the position abroad has been thoroughly-adjusted._______
Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the trading was the Morgan support It was wonderfully well handled and while there was no attempt to bid stocks up the market never lost its head. The extent of this buying can only be guessed at, but some houses placed it at 150,000 shares. It certainly saved lhe market from getting entirely out of hand.
Halle & Stieglitz were considered the most-important buyers of Reading, especially in the afternoon. Traders thought they took about 25,000 shares altogether on a
In a very heavy day’s trading two stocks, Reading and Union Pacific, exceeded 200,000 shares, while Steel common and Amalgamated Copper exceeded 100,000. These four stocks, in fact, made up 51 per cent, of the business, but eleven other issues exceeded 10,000 shares, and the general activity was large.’
The closing quotations left the average price of twenty active railroad stocks at the lowest figure since December, 1900, the first reaction after the boom which started with the election of President McKinley. It will be observed that practically’ the whole of the advance in stocks recorded in the seven years of prosperity has been wiped out.
Some of the most active traders on the floor, for at least two hours during the day stood out of the market, refusing to trade in its then demoralized condition. This :s, of course, almost the last extreme of nervousness, but it shows how deeply the feeling of anxiety has penetrated.
