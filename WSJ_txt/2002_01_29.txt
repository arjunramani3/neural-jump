Looking for goods news for stocks? Today, the Federal Reserve will conclude a two-day meeting on interest rates. Most investors are betting the Fed keeps the key federal-funds rate at 1.75%, amid recent evidence that the economy is showing signs of life. But even if the Fed doesn't cut rates, the stock market could get some help if the Fed releases an accompanying statement that is bullish on the economy, some say.
"Companies have expanded with heavy debt and aggressive mergers and acquisitions accounting," said Mr. [Mike Clark] of CSFB. "The fear is that in the wake of Enron more stringent accounting regulations and practices" will force problems for many more companies, he said.
Outside the U.S., stocks fell in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, dropped 1.22 points, or 1.01%, to 119.14.

U.S. stocks fell in heavy trading as fears grew that accounting troubles similar to those hounding Enron could affect more companies.
With stocks still trading at historically high valuations, the doubts about the quality of earnings of many companies could weigh on the stock market for the foreseeable future, according to some traders. If investors become more risk-averse, it would lower prices they are willing to pay for earnings of all kinds of companies, even if the economy turns around this year, these traders said.
In trading that reminded some of last fall's painful selloff, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.51%, or 247.51 points, to 9618.24, its biggest one-day loss since Oct. 29. The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 2.62%, or 50.92 points, to 1892.99, a sizable drop but not as bad as the fall just on Jan. 18, when the Nasdaq declined 2.79%.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index yesterday fell 2.86%, or 32.42, to 1100.64. It was the biggest percentage loss and point loss for the S&P 500, a measure of large stocks, since September. The index now stands only 8.10 points above its Sept. 10 close. Stocks finished near their lows for the day, an indication of the growing concern throughout the day.
"Institutions are dumping [stocks] because they don't want to be caught with an unexploded bomb" like Enron, said Mike Clark, who runs global equity trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Bonds surged on the weakness in stocks, as investors searched for safer investments.
Looking for goods news for stocks? Today, the Federal Reserve will conclude a two-day meeting on interest rates. Most investors are betting the Fed keeps the key federal-funds rate at 1.75%, amid recent evidence that the economy is showing signs of life. But even if the Fed doesn't cut rates, the stock market could get some help if the Fed releases an accompanying statement that is bullish on the economy, some say.
Others said President Bush's State of the Union speech last night could lift spirits.
"We've had 11 rate cuts but we're looking for a recovery now, and we need some concrete evidence," said Alfred Goldman, chief investment strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. "If the Fed comes out with a statement that it's not as worried about the economy, the market should respond positively."
Yesterday, stocks began the session with slight gains, buoyed by upbeat news on consumer confidence and durable-goods orders. But the market began to fall, and the selling picked up steam in the afternoon, sparked by a series of worries about companies with accounting concerns and those facing skepticism about earnings.
First, shares of Williams Cos. plunged after the energy company delayed its earnings report to assess its financial obligations to a struggling communications-unit spinoff. Williams shares finished the day down 22% to $18.78.
Tyco also began to tumble, amid word the conglomerate paid $20 million to a director and a charity he controls, news that added to long-held worries about the quality of earnings and corporate governance at the company. Tyco dropped 20%, or $8.35, to $33.65 a share.
The last straw for stocks was news that PNC Financial was being forced to reduce 2001 earnings by about $155 million after a Federal Reserve review raised doubts about its accounting. PNC fell 9.4%, pulling down the entire banking sector.
"Confidence began oozing out of the market -- Enron set the stage and Tyco and Williams news made it worse," said Mr. Goldman. "We've had a tremendous run since the lows of Sept. 21 and have been selling off for three weeks, and it got worse."
Since the collapse of Enron, investors have had little patience for any questions about corporate practices. Even Tyco's efforts to point out that a payment made to an outside director was fully disclosed in a proxy statement did little to reassure investors.
"People don't want to own stocks once there are any questions raised about their accounting practices," said Bob O'Brien, head of equity trading for Evergreen Investment Management in Boston. "They aren't waiting to see how it plays out. They are selling now."

Indeed, each new piece of news was scrutinized by investors for signs of trouble yesterday, including International Business Machines' announcement that Samuel J. Palmisano, long the heir apparent at Big Blue, would succeed Louis V. Gerstner as chief executive officer. IBM shares lost almost 5% on the day.
Other companies viewed by at least some investors as having aggressive accounting techniques also suffered yesterday, including Calpine, Cendant and WorldCom.
Lost in all the hand wringing were the upbeat consumer-confidence and durable-goods figures, just the latest in a series of indications that the U.S. economy has begun to recover. But lately investors haven't cared very much about the outlook for earnings, more worried about which company will be the next own up to acccounting misdeeds.
"The market needs some way to legitimize earnings," said Mr. Clark. "The level of trust is low."
Behind the market's surge in the late 1990s was the widespread belief that paying more for earnings was fine, because they would likely continue to rise. But if they can't even be sure how valid corporate earnings really are, it may not matter if they are rising, nervous investors said.
Traders pointed to other signs of the increasing wariness in recent weeks that could put a crimp on stocks if they continue. Among them: continued heavy flows into money-market funds and other safe investments, like convertible bonds, instead of stocks.
"Companies have expanded with heavy debt and aggressive mergers and acquisitions accounting," said Mr. Clark of CSFB. "The fear is that in the wake of Enron more stringent accounting regulations and practices" will force problems for many more companies, he said.
"It adds up to a more difficult environment," said Mr. Clark.
Meanwhile, the Fed's interest-rate decision today -- while it will fixate investors when announced at about 2:15 p.m. EST -- could have less impact than similar decisions in the past year, some traders and analysts say. Interest rates are already quite low and investors are waiting for signs of a true earnings rebound before plunging back into stocks, rather than even lower rates. But upbeat words from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan could help restore some of the confidence that has been slipping in recent days, even if a rate cut remains unlikely.
Outside the U.S., stocks fell in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, dropped 1.22 points, or 1.01%, to 119.14.
In major U.S. market action:
Major stock indexes fell. On the Big Board, where 1.757 billion shares traded, 964 stocks rose while 2,160 stocks declined.
Bonds rose. The 10-year Treasury note rose 26/32, or $8.125 for each $1,000 invested, to push down the yield to 4.966%. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 31/32, lowering its yield to 5.401%.
The dollar fell. Late in New York, it traded at 86.55 cents to the euro and 133.30 yen to the dollar, down from 86.23 cents and 133.51 yen.
