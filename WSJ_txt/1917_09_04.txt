THE STOCK MARKET
HEAVY LIQUIDATION CONTINUES
After strong opening and general upward movement in industrials the market gives way under leadership of New York Central, St. Paul and New Haven—Peace rumors revived—Russian situation ominous.
Sales, 1,101.900 shares.
It required only small volume to raise quotations. The shorts exhibited nervousness, as evidenced by the wide fluctuations on the way up.	v
Steel made a new high for the day at 111%. At tho high levels Bethlehem B gained 2 pointe, Baldwin 8%, Crucible 1%, Marine preferred 8, Central Leather 1%, Atlantic-Gulf 2%, Texas Co. 7%, and General Motors 1%.
A block of 1,000 shares of New York Central brought the price of that stock to a new low point on the .present movement at 80. This stock has found its way back in the 5% category of railway stocks and apparently tho investment public has ceased' to look for a 6% dividend rate.
Look for Price Fixing Action
The week will probably see some developments in the price fixing policy of the Administration. Members of the War Industries Board meet Wednesday, and it is anticipated that an announcement will be made regarding copper prices. Decision as to steel prices is being delayed because of the complications involved, every manufacturer 'Jiaving a different basis of cost. This fact is pertinent: The Government can not7fix steel prices -arbitrarily under existing legislation. Passage of tho Pomerene bill, granting such power, might be met by serious opposition, and the constitutionality of that measure would be a question for the courts. Therefore, it is argued, the Government must dicker with the steel interests directly, and these interests will not sacrifice their earnings to such an extent as to jeopardize the prosperity of the steel industry.
Liquidation in Rail Stucks
A wave of liquidation in leading rail stocks featured the second hour. New York Central made a new record low at 76%. When the Stock Exchange closed in 1914 the stock tonched 77. New Haven sold at 29, also a new record. The prediction made months ago that New Haven would cross Southern Railway seemed likely to bb fulfilled. St. Paul sold to G2%, off 3%.
Causes for this decline in these issues are very much the same for each case. These roads need money and the radical changes in the money market in the last year make it impossible to get money on a reasonable basis. If New York Central can not sell bonds, it is argued, what may be expected of New Haven? lhe situation unfortunately influences such stock as Southern Pacific and Union Pacific, which are not in need of funds.
Delaware & Hudson broke par but held comparatively well. This road also finds it difficult to finance its needs in the present money market. A large short interest remains in the stock, which has been loaning at a premium of % to %%.	„
In the industrial list prices held better. Steel common made up 2 of its 6 pointy lost last week and Crucible made up 1’4 of Its 11-point loss. General Electric and Texas Oil made quick recoveries on small volume.
Complete Reversal in Form
Market had a complete reversal m form in the early afternoon trading and with the decLne came a greater volume of stocks. Liquidation in old-time investment rail stocks started the downward movement and it spread through the entire industrial list Even the Marine shares, which had exhibited the usual signs of accumulation, lost heavily.
Nothing was apparent to account for the heavy selling. The factors facing the railroads were well known weeks ago. It was said in commission houses that big stop orders placed in the market by large investors caused the dumping of more than the market could take readily.
All the favorable stock market influences which greeted the new week were dissipated after an hour of lively trading and the market assumed again a downward tendency. This tendency became so p’ronounced in the afternoon session that old-time investment issues, whose merit is unassailable, sold off radically in sympathy with the decline in less favored issuefi.	__	_______ __	...................
The situation brought to light in a forcible way the. arbitrarily under existing legislation, acute status of railway companies which are compelled to ~	■
borrow money in competition with Governmente. With a bond market trembling under the load of Government financing these railroads are forced to extremes of financing and they are paying rates of interest which no individual would think of paying. New York Central stock sold at the lowest price since 1875 and it was offered even as freely as in the uncertain days preceding the closing of the New York Stock • Exchange at the beginning of the war. New Haven, St, Paul and Delaware & Hudson also made new low Tecord. Investment boxes were opened and these stocks could not be absorbed without great sacrifices.
The industrial list opened well and gave signs of a reawakening, but it sagged badly when the rails began to slip away. Steel common was in good demand in the first hour, but sold off more than four points in the next two hours.
In the Russian situation the market professed to see a cause fefr the stock market’s weakness. The capture of Riga indicates a sweep of the German invaders through western Russia and a possible fall of Petrograd. This situation is naturally discouraging since it opens up new sources of food for Germany. Germany's alleged plea for pence is also discarded as unreal at this juncture, but Germany is not in the habit of suing for peace when a new campaign is just getting into swing.
Opening Had Improved Tone
The new week opened with an improved tone in the stock market, the influence of the defeat of the La Follette party in the Senate being reflected by better quotations in the whole industrial list
Steel common opened at 5,000 shares from 110% to 111, up 1% to 1% from the previous closing. Bethlehem B gained 1% in the first few sales. Crucible was up. 1% at the opening and Central Leather gained* %.
Tobacco stocks were fractionally higher. Marine stocks were flrm but did not reflect any enthusiasm over the new peace developments in the German Reichstag. Rails were inactive.
A vigorous movement of the shorts accelerated the market towards the end of the first half hour and prices were carried above the opening level. The short interest is said to be enormous, having accumulated in large measure in the closing days of last week.
. Senate Action Reflected
Defeat of the La Follette group of Senators is a blow to the would-be conscriptionists oi' wealth. The overwhelming defeat of this party, by a vote of 55 to 20, should put at rest all fears of too radical legislation by Congress on the taxation of war profits. The Senate practically placed itself on record as favoring a policy of cor-
e
Peace Talk Revived
Peace talk was revived but the victories of Germany in Russia were cited as offsetting the growing power of the Socialists in Germany. When the Kaiser sees the Social-u«uiv piuwu ...Sv.. .... .............„	- ....-. — ists getting stronger he commands his military forces to
oration development. In the lost two weeks the stock : attack a weak point in his enemies’ lines. The temporary market reflected the worst that might have happened in flush of victory has always appeased the German peace '	*	partv in the past. It is considered doubtful* therefore,
whether any request for peace can come out of Germany in the near future.
Union Pacific lost 3 points to a new recent low ot l^SU Just a vear ago Union sold at 141. Southern Pacific ‘fielded 1%’to 91%. It sold at 97% a year ago. New York Central made a new record low at <6. It sold a1 103 a year ago. Great Northern, Northern Pacific, and Atchison lost ground rapidly.

the Senate. There was a sudden turn in events, however, and the worst that seems apparent is a tax equivalent to about 82% on profits over and above the average in the pre-war period.	'
Some Wide Fluctuations
At the end of the first Irour prices of leading industrials were a point to 2 points above the opening prices.
