Stocks rebounded to their third-biggest gain this year on Wednesday, buoyed by a sharp recovery in energy shares and new evidence that the U.S. economy is strengthening.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 225.52 points, or 2.2%, to 10249.54. The S&P 500 rose 2.6%, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is now positive for the year.
All three indexes more than recovered their steep losses from Tuesday. Investors had dumped energy stocks in reaction to the failure of BP's "top kill" effort to plug the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. A sub-index tracking the S&P's energy sector rose 4.3% on Wednesday.
The news regarding the oil spill didn't improve much on Wednesday, with efforts to use a robot to install a containment device also hitting complications. But traders said there were enough positive developments elsewhere, including strong economic data and a few favorable corporate announcements, for them to look past the disaster for now.
"It looks to us mostly like it was a matter of [Tuesday] being an uncertain environment in which people were looking to sell first and ask questions later," said strategist Craig Peckham, of Jefferies & Co. "Now, cooler heads are prevailing."
Walt Disney jumped 4.2% after the head of its consumer-products business issued a strong long-term forecast for the company's retail sales. Hewlett-Packard rose 3.7% after the company received antitrust approval to acquire Palm. Palm shares climbed 0.9%.
Safe-haven assets such as Treasurys and gold were lower, as investors showed a renewed appetite for riskier assets. As bond prices fall, yields rise, and the 10-year Treasury note yield edged up to 3.336%.
