Some weeks ago the stock was well supported in a few^ minutes a general covering movement set in and- between 56 and 59 and talk was general that a sizeable ...	pool had been formed to mark up the stock in a demon-
tration against shorts. Famous Players earned over $6 •a share for the common in the first quarter of 1921’and its film rentals have been well maintained in the second quarter. Theatre receipts, because of the unduly warm weather, have shown slightly more than the usual seasonal drop, but on the aggregate better film rentals have made up this decline. Company’s operating expenses will be considerably reduced because of smaller wages and salaries to employes.
Big Operator Takes in Extensive Short Lines
The discomfiture of the bears was completed early in the afternoon when big buying orders came into the Mexican oils, the entire railroad group and equipment shares. Before 2 o’clock Baldwin ran.up to 75%, up over 5 points net. Pan-American “A” sold at 48, up 8% points from the low of the first hour. The “B” stock rallied over 5 points. The big buying in the rails was in Southern Pacific, Great Northern, Baltimore & Ohio, Northern Pacific and Canadian Pacific. One big stock -market operator who has been bearish for the last year was a big buyer of stocks, undoubtedly almost entirely for short account. Four commission houses were credited with having bought 100,000 shares of stock for this one individual, principally in Northern Pacic, Crucible, eum, Pierce-Arrow, Sinclair, Studebaker ber.

ing operating deficits so far this year, but its maintenance charges have been large, running about 47% of gross revenue. Judging from its past record, L. & N. would be as well able to maintain the 7% dividend rate upon such an increase of stock as almost any other road. For the five years ended with 1919,. which include two years of federal control, its actual earnings averaged rather better than 15% upon the present stock and were as high as 23 and 22% in 1916 and 1917 respectively. If the company is to pay 7% cash dividends-after a 50% stock dividend, the price is not too high.
New Highs Near dose
New highs were made during the last half hour. U. S. Steel common sold at 75%, which was % above the top on the last previous rally and was 5% points above the low of the last month. Studebaker touthed 80. Baldwin at 76%, was up 6% points net. Mexican Petroleum touched 101%, while Pan-American “A” got into new high ground at 50%. Northern Pacific and Great Northern preferred continued to lead the rails. The sharp advance in the rail division was one of the impressive features of the day’s operations.

Buying .which put Louisville & Nashville points was of course based upon the coming dend. If the company were allowed by the Commerce Commission to issue all of the increase which it has asked its stockholders to authorize, it would mean a stock dividend of .73% upon the present issue. That would still be well within the accumulated profit and loss surplus, which amounts to more than 100% upon the present $72,000,000

Studebaker Sales Increase
Some light is thrown on the strength in Studebaker by the sales record established by this company in the New York district in June. In that month 451 cars were sold in Greater New York as compared with 82 cars in June, 1920, an increase of 450%. The value of these cars was $818,675, against $192,102, a gain of 326%. For the first six months of 1921 Studebaker sold 1,659 cars in this dis-, triet, against 655 cars in the first half of 1920, an increase of 153%. The important part of this statement is that the ratio of gain is steadily increasing month by month. The Jesuits in the - New York district are typical of what Studebaker is accomplishing throughout the country, but '■he big bear operators continue to sell the stock short.
International Paper Mills Being Reopened
The market got into new high ground early in the second hour and Mexican Petroleum at 94% was up 6 points from the early low. International Paper common made a new high r-mi rjihik movement, Belling up to 55%. Over-I night news was "bullish which no doubt was reflected in I the ^ett^r. demand-far this stock.
