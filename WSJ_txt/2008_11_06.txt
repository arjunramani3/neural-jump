"It's not that people have capital gains to offset, it's that people want to stockpile losses against future gains," said Lawrence Glazer, a managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston.

Unable to fight off the gloom about the economy, stock prices slid for a second straight day, producing the biggest two-day percentage drop since Oct. 19-20, 1987.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 443.48 points, or 4.9%, to 8695.79. The two-day loss since the rally on Election Day is 929.49 points, equal to 9.7% -- which is the biggest in point terms in the 112-year history of the Dow.
The Dow has given back roughly two-thirds of its gains since hitting a 5 1/2-year low on Oct. 27, when it closed at 8175.77. The blue chips are now just 520 points above that level, and off 34.4% for the year.
Traders said the selloff may have been driven in part by expectations that the October employment report due out Friday morning will come in much worse than expected. Economists have been predicting job losses would total about 200,000 for the month and the unemployment rate would rise to 6.3% from 6.1%.
The Labor Department reported Thursday morning that weekly unemployment claims rose to their highest level in 25 years.
Meanwhile, retailers reported worse-than-expected sales for October.
Reflecting that negative economic picture and the probability of reduced demand for energy, oil prices slid 6.9% to their lowest level since March 2007, a 14% decline in two days.
General Motors, which along with Ford Motor is expected to report grim quarterly results Friday, was the biggest decliner among the Dow's 30 components, down nearly 14%.
Among other big losers were banks and brokerage firms. Wells Fargo lost more than 9% as the company readied a sale of stock to raise billions of dollars in new capital.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.03% to 904.88, which combined with Wednesday's losses also was the biggest two-day percentage decline since Oct. 19-20, 1987. (In the case of both the Dow and the S&P, the Oct. 19-20, 1987, drop included the Black Monday crash and the advance the next day.)
Even buyers who find stocks attractive at recent levels see no reason to chase the market higher, traders said, and stepped aside after the bounce that began last week. "The market is sloppy," said Andrew Brooks, who heads up stock trading at T. Rowe Price Group. Trading volume has been relatively light.
As stocks fell, prices on short-term Treasurys gained, responding to the cut in interest rates by the U.K. and the European Central Bank. The rise in the price of the two-year Treasury note pushed the yield down to 1.308%, the lowest since June 13, 2003. The dollar gained on the euro.
Hedge funds likely remain active sellers of stocks as they contend with investor withdrawals. Many hedge funds have deadlines that require investors to submit withdrawal requests by Nov. 15.
Another negative for the market is selling by individual investors looking to capture losses for tax-planning purposes.
"It's not that people have capital gains to offset, it's that people want to stockpile losses against future gains," said Lawrence Glazer, a managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston. That's especially true amid expectations that capital-gains rates could be headed higher with a new Congress and a new president.
"The story for November could be tax-loss selling," Mr. Glazer said.
