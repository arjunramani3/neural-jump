Abreast of the Market
Stock Prices Score Sharpest Rise in 2 Months On Hopes for Strong Anti-Inflation Moves
By Victor J. HlIJ«tY
Hopes for strong action against inflation helped the stock market yesterday to halt an ll-sesmon decline. It scored its best gain in more than eight weeks on a broad front in moderately active trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had plunged almost 90 points in the previous 11 sessions, rocketed 23 points to 607.56; this was its best gain since it climbed 23.78 points on Aug. 7.
"People realized that the administration plans to take some serious anti-inflation steps,” commented Patrick L. McDonald, research director of Bosworth. Sullivan & Co. President Ford is scheduled to unveil his economic proposals after the close today. Underscoring the administration's tough attitude, Mr. McDonald added, were indications from White House officials that the program probably will provide tax relief for lower-income persons and a tax surcharge on individuals in higher-income orackets.
Another sign of administration resoluteness, brokers said, was President Ford's cancellation over the weekend of Russian grain contracts, involving 2.4 million tons of com and one million tons of wheat.
Prime Rate Cute
Another potent boost for the market was provided by the news that the Federal Reserve System apparently again lowered a key interest-rate target, lowering the range on federal funds, the reserves banks lend each other, to 10%% to 10%%. As a result, more banks were expected to follow the recent move by a few in reducing their prime lending rate to 11%% from 12%; yesterday First National Bank of Chicago and Manufacturers Hanover Trust dropped their rates to 11%%.
In its rebound yesterday, the industrial average bounced off a 12-year low ot 584.56. The transportation index racked up an even greater percentage rise than the industrial average—4.84% against 3.93%— and the utility indicator also rose sharply.
The vast sweep of the advance was apparent in the 1,301 New York Stock Exchange issues that gained, more than five times the 228 losers. Issues that sank to new 1974 lows dropped to 68 from 235 on Friday, and new highs rose to four from two.
Also contributing to yesterday's surprising strength, brokers said, were indications that petroleum price cuts-mayn’t be opposed by oil-exporting nations as much as many U.S. investors fear. Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia’s petroleum minister, said his country wouldn’t cut back production to offset petroleum-conservation measures by consuming nations.
Yesterday’s market bounded ahead despite the news last Friday that unemployment last month jumped 0.4-point to a seasonally adjusted 5.8%.
Sluggish *75 Seen
James J. O’Leary, vice chairman of U.S. Trust Co., said that “even though the Federal Reserve is moving to relax credit gradually, the measures which they have already pursued this year will be felt with a fairly long lag well into next year” and that this lagged weakness “may turn out to have more of a depressing effect on commodity prices than has been generally recognized.” But although "we are expecting a continued sluggish economy in 1974 with increasing slack in employment .of labor and plant,” he added, "we don’t anticipate a serious recession.”
Big Board volume amounted to 15 million shares, down from Friday's 15,910,000-share total. Trades of 10,000 shares or more, a measure of institutional activity, fell to 78 from 127 in the prior session.
Gainers led the losers almost five-to-two on the American Stock Exchange and its index spurted 1.84 to 62.95. Turnover edged up to 1,790,000 shares from 1,680,000 Friday. A sharp 1.41-point rise was posted by the National Association of Securities
