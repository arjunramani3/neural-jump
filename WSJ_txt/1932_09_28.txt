In listless trading:, except for
In listless trading, except for one shortlived burst of moderate activity, stocks pushed forward again yesterday, the leaders moving ahead from fractions to around three pniTifr. The bond market worked higher. The best grade rail Issues gained, while the more speculative carrier obligations eased off a trifle. Wheat pushed up a fraction of a cent a bushel but cotton closed around the day's lows, off six to 10 points.
The pace of tbe market was slow at tbe start, with prices irregular. Steel common opened unchanged; Telephone was down fractionally; Central was up a quarter of a point, and Allied Chemical fractionally higher. A brief period of hesitancy, and slightly lower prices, was succeeded by a steady tone in the market and the upward move began. Harvester stocks and the mail -order company shares moved -forward first. International Harvester moving forward easily.	.
Through the morning, trading was practically featureless, although strength In Pullman and Mack Trucks attracted some attention. Early in the afternoon, the list turned strong and activity picked up, with stocks reaching the day’s best levels in a brief run-up. Steel, at the day's best price was up over 2 points; Telephone ran up more than 3; Harvester was up over 2, and" Mack Trucks about 3. In the late trading, the list sagged to close fractionally under the day’s best prices in apathetic trading.
The news of the day included the Pennsylvania and New York Central carloadings figures for the week ended September 24. Both roads recorded increases over the previous week, and a smaller percentage decline from the 1931 week than heretofore. The reports of the two eastern trunk lines, and for some of the western roads, brought new buying into the rails. Central was up 1% points on the day, Atchison more than 3, and both Northern Pacific and Great Northern were moderately active at, higher levels.
The sharp pickup in coal dumpings at Dake Erie ports in the week ended September 26, when they reached 988,616 tons, only 73,000 tons under the like 1931 week, stimulated interest in the coal carrying roads* shares. -
Automobile output figures, for August and the eight months, had little -effect marketwise. The motor stocks, as a group, were strong. Output for August was down to 90,324 units, off about 21,000 from July and less than 50% of the August, 1931, total.
Markets abroad were lower. In London, stocks were irregular, but most of the changes were on the downside. In Paris, the market was weak.
registered for the week ended September 17. Output was above that of the preceding week, while -in the three previous 'years, the week-to-week ebange-was downward.
The most -encouraging thing about the figures was the’"betterment in tbe -central industrial region. The decrease in the area was only 1X8%, -against a drop -of -15.3% in the 'Week ended September 17 from the like 1931 week.
- Equipment Loan -Demand Ficks Up '
Bequests for loans from the Reconstruction 'Finance Corp, from the railroads are picking up. - The New Haven, the Baltimore & Ohio, and "others, have followed-the lead of the Pennsylvania' in asking for funds. Equipment loans are one form of aid the R. F. C. can give which should prove of real benefit to carriers, it they really need new equipment. Old equipment means higher operating expenses; new equipment will pay for Itself, provided there is sufficient traffic to put it in full use. Building the new cars means some amelioration in the unemployment situation.

A Year Ago and Today
For a number of railroads, September will mark the first month in many when net operating income will exceed the similar month of the previous year. Very few roads, if any, will show better gross, but tbe upturn in traffic will put revenues at a level which, coupled with the substantial savings in operating expenses, will permit better operating income showings for a good many carriers.
. The level at which railroad common stocks now -are selling is interesting in comparison with-where .they were selling.at the same time a year ago. Many carriers then were in the middle of a period of abruptly declining traffic, with-ths earnings trend steadily growing worse. A good many roads were faced with either receivership or the necessity of Government advances to tide them -over. Railroad stocks were reflecting the downtrend in earnings.
Since a year ago, many roads have added to their fixed charges by borrowing'money to pay interest and taxes and for other current expenditures. 'Most of the money advanced to the carriers has been entirely unproductive so far as getting new traffic or paving the way for new traffic is concerned. It is a dead load, and naturally the equity suffers \vhen this is put in ahead of it.
As the table of 10 rail stocks shows, only one, D. L. & W., is selling above the price at which it sold a year ago. The biggest declines have been registered by Atchison, Union Pacific and New York Central. The table follows:

Pools and Specialists
Adoption by the Stock Exchange Governing Committee of a rule in regard to participation of specialists, their partners or their firms in .pools, such as that suggested Lby Richard Whitney, would go a .long way toward clearing up a situation which had not been thoroughly understood.	,
Mr. Whitney’s defense of some pool operations is perfectly sound. The only trouble is, the stigma of the “nefarious pools’* inevitably attaches itself to many group operations. Certainly the specialist, who has access to information on the market in a stock, and supposedly makes a market in the stock for the general public, does not belong in any such group.

Electric output, in the week ended .September 24, .was off only 10.2% from the like 1931 week, a slightlv smaller drop than that
