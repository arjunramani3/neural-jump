Stocks finished higher after another day of wild swings amid mixed news about the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung in an 816-point range, including outsized gains and losses that ended with a surge in the final 90 minutes of trading. The blue chips closed up 401.35 points, or 4.7%, at 8979.26, recouping more than half of Wednesday's losses.
At their low for the day, the Dow industrials fell below Friday's close, the lowest in five years. It was the eighth intraday move of 650 points or more in 12 trading days this month and the 10th triple- digit change at the finish.
Economic data released Thursday contained a few bright spots, including signs that U.S. inflation is in check -- which sent stocks up early. But the market turned around after a report that factory activity in the Philadelphia area slumped severely in September. A reading of home-builder sentiment remained at extremely depressed levels.
"I've never seen swings like this," said Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx, a New York brokerage. "All the nervousness is breeding a lot of volatility."
Oil futures ended regular trading below $70 a barrel for the first time in more than a year, down 6.3% to $69.85 in New York after a report of increased U.S. petroleum inventories. At the start of the day, that was considered a sign of slumping demand in a weak economy. Later, some analysts suggested that low energy prices would help to encourage consumer spending.
Wal-Mart Stores, a Dow component, rose 9.1%.
The S&P 500-stock index, which Wednesday had its worst percentage drop since the 1987 crash, jumped 4.3% to 946.43. All its sectors posted gains, led by the consumer-discretionary category, up 6.6%.
Traders said stocks' late-day surge was driven largely by buyers attracted by what they consider bargain-level prices. They also noted that there likely was buying ahead of Friday's expiration of options contracts.
But it remains unclear whether the market's recent decline has been put to rest for good. The Dow remains nearly 37% below its record close last October and down more than 17% this month alone.
Treasury prices rose Thursday, a sign that investors still are seeking the safety of government guarantees. The yield on the two-year note fell to 1.576%. But gold futures, traditionally another safe- haven investment, fell 4.1% to $801.50 per troy ounce.
Corrections & Amplifications
