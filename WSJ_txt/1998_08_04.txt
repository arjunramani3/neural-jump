Stocks Plunge 299.43, Year’s Worst Fall
Industrials
Down 9.1%
From Peak

Investor psychology took a turn tor the worse yesterday, triggering a miniavalanche in stock prices that slashed nearly 300 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average - accelerating a decline that has now wiped out five months of gains.
In the second-busiest day ever on the New York Stock Exchange, selling momentum built from midmorning through the afternoon. By day's end, the Dow industrials had sunk 299.43 points, or 3.4r;i, to 8-187.31, the year's biggest decline on both a point and percentage basis.
The industrials' drop took the blue chips down a total of 9. l'/< from the July 17 closing high of 9337.97. nearing the W'li threshold that constitutes a “correction" in Wall Street parlance. Each stock in the industrials was down for the day, except Procter & Gamble.
The trading session started out innocently enough. There was a brief morning
rally, which fizzled following dashed hopes that the Japanese yen would rebound against the dollar. Selling soon hit stocks of banks and other financial companies and quickly spread to technology stocks, traders said. The downturn picked up steam as word spread on trading floors that Ralph
Acampora, Prudential Securities' bullish technical analyst, turned tail and pre-
dicted the Dow industrials' decline could
grow to 15% or 209? from its recent high.
But what worried traders on Wall Street
was the relative calm of the plunge and the growing concern that the worst of the sell-off may be yet to come. "I didn't see any sense of a selling climax," said Michael Molnar, managing director of retail sales trading at Salomon Smith Barney. “There was no sense of panic."	.
Yesterday's decline was the third-big-gest one-day point loss ever, though not nearly on the record list on a percentage basis. The 554.26-point drop of Oct. 27, for example, measured 7.18%, and the 1987 stock-market crash was a wholly different animal at a record 22.619;.
Big Board volume of more than 826.7 million shares was second only to the nearly 1.2 billion that traded on Oct. 28, the day after the 554.26-point drop.
The Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its second-biggest point drop, sinkings"). 16 points, or 3.5%. to 1785.64. (The biggest point drop was 115.83 points on Oct. 27.) Other indexes fell even harder. The Dow Jones Transportation Average gave up 110.77 points, or 3.5%, to 3087.28, and is now

down 5.2% for the year.
Trading, though historically heavy, was too light to mark the end of the sell-off that started weeks ago among small-capitalization stocks and gradually spread through the market. Mr. Molnar said. It probably will take another one-billion share day “to hit that climactic selling that scares all of the buy orders out of the market," he said.
Traders described the market selling as orderly, attributing much of it to waves of computerized trading programs driven by lite stock and index-futures markets. "The selling pressure was relentless but it really was very systematic." said Arthur Hogan, a Jefferies & Co. block trader. "The psychology clearly reversed, and you got the sense that this lime, there wasn’t anybody out there buying the dip."
Even before yesterday's sell-off, many stocks had been wobbly, dragged down by concerns over weak corporate profits, continued uncertainty over Asia's economic woes and President Clinton's legal troubles. Indeed, the reaction on Tuesday of last week to the news that Monica Lewinsky had been granted immunity to testify - the Dow industrials fell 93.46 points, or more than 1%, for the day-sltowed how investors dislike uncertainty and how little there was to prop up expensive stocks. Still, blue chips overall had held up much better for the year than most smaller stocks.
Yesterday, the same blue-chip stocks that had held the market indexes aloft in recent weeks while smaller stocks plunged began their own slide. Citicorp sank 9 % to 151. International Business Machines dropped 5 15/16 to 126 13/16. Merrill Lvnclt lost 5 15/16 to 9(l '».
Tlte morning rally already had petered out when Mr. Acampora’s change of heart hit the markets. In late morning, the once-upbeat Mr. Acampora began telling clients that big-cap stocks were headed the way of the small caps. Around lunchtime, word was out that one of the standard bearers for lite long bull market had rolled

up Itis banner. The selling accelerated.
Mr. Acampora. Prudential Securities' director of technical research and one of the first to predict the Dow industrials would surpass 10000 this year, said the Dow could fall into a range between 7470 to 7937 in the next few months. “We're already in a bear market for a lot of the market," Mr. Acampora said. Many second-tier stocks "have gone right through the floor, and now we're going to see them take out some of the big names," lie added.
Soon other Wall Street strategists joined in, calling for a steeper decline and tossing around the term "bear market." (A bear market typically represents a 20% or more decline in market indices from their highs, though many individual stocks are undergoing their own bear markets.)
The selling didn't let up in the afternoon. The market averages continued falling right to the close.
As the losses mounted, some traders started wondering if the Big Board's trading-halt rules would kick in, as they did for the first and only time during the Ocl. 27 plunge, Mr. Hogan said. But a market shutdown was never within sight because the shutdown triggers since have been widened to 10%, not the 500 points as the triggers were then set in October. The Dow industrials would have had to plunge 900 points before 2:30 p.m. EDT yesterday tor the trading halt to have kicked in.
l-'or tlte most part, traders seemed surprised at how easily the market could handle such a big sell-off. A top trader at Merrill Lynch said his trading desk was busier on some days last week than it was yesterday. He said the firm's institutional clients were doing as much buying as selling yesterday.
Other traders voiced concerns about what lies ahead.“What bothers me most is you don't see climactic selling," said Michael Clark, a stock trader at Credit Suisse First Boston. “You see a grudging acceptance of lower prices and we are seeing some fear build up because people can't get /’lensi- Turn to ('ll.

"The gains have been so concentrated in that blue-chip sector," CSFB's Mr. Clark said. “That was the signal this was going to happen.”
Mr. Clark said the market faces an oversupply problem: New money flowing into mutual funds isn't keeping up with the flood of new stocks and bonds being issued on Wall Street. "What would be helpful here would be to unplug the calendar" of new issues for the rest of the summer, he said. "Right now we don't need competition from new issues."
World-wide, stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 3.66 points, or 1.93%, to 185.55.
