Abreast of the Market
Industrials Rise 22.14 for Fourth Gain in Row, But Some Analysts Believe Worst Is Not Over
By James Cabbebby
The stock market yesterday ran up its strongest gain in two weeks. But analysts called it another rally in an essentially bearish market and said the bear hasn't yet been chased out by the bull.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 674.05, up 22.14 points, bringing its total gain during four consecutive days of advances to 46.86 points. On Sept. 5, it posted a gain of 22.76 points. “I'd just as soon these rallies fizzled out quickly; they simply help put off the date when the market touches bottom,” commented Anthony Ludovici, analyst with Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day.
Traders attributed yesterday’s surge in the industrial average in part to a statement by Treasury Secretary Simon at a morning press conference that he expects a "further decline” in short-term interest rates. But another administration official, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said he expects the economy to remain "dull and iuggish” and “inflation-ridden" at least until mid-1975.
Brokers noted that the market, hypersensitive to trends in interest rates, has rallied several times earlier this year on indications that record interest rates were softening. Each time, the rally quickly faded and the industrial average reached new lows. "This is a typical rally in response to a glimmer of hope on the money front,” commented Charles Jensen, analyst with Merkin & Co. “But the glamours were dull, volume was comparatively light; it wasn’t the kind of rally that can sustain itself.”
The utility and transportation indicators closed somewhat higher.
New York Stock Exchange volume rose to 17 million shares from Wednesday’s 11,760,000.
Advances Topped Declines
Big Board advances quickly opened up a five-to-one lead over declines and held it. At the close, advances led declines 1,291 to 229. Only five issues touched new 1974 highs, compared with two the day before; and 67 stocks fell to 1974 lows, down from 159 on Wednesday.
After the close, the New York Federal Reserve Bank reported that business loans at major New York City banks rose $279 million in the week ended Wednesday, compared with a rise of $207 million the previous week. The market has been keeping track of the weekly loan figures for signs that loan demand might be easing, and interest rates peaking out; but in recent weeks its attention seems to have swung more to other indicators of interest-rate trends, such as Treasury bill rates.
The American Stock Exchange index also rose, closing at 66.09, up 2.03 points. Advances led declines by more than two-to-one. Volume rose to 2,250,000 shares from 1,700,000 on Wednesday. In the over-the-counter market, the National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ composite index tacked on 1.40 points to close at 59.52.	*
One broker hedging on whether the market has yet seen bottom was Donald Hahn, analyst with A. G. Becker & Co., thicago. “It’s 50-50 whether the market has another down leg ahead of it; the bottom already could have been reached,” he said. Mr. Hahn said he based this comment partly on the fact that some of the market barometers followed by the brokerage house already have reached their lows of previous bear markets.
Although he remains bearish on the market’s near-term outlook, Mr. Ludovici of Tucker Anthony suggested that investors begin taking positions in “seasoned equities with proven track records” because these issues will lead a bull market

After the close, the New York Stock Exchange reported that short interest on the Big Board fell 1,081,912 shares to 18,192,212 in the month ended Sept. 13. Short interest represents the amount of borrowed shares sold earlier and not yet replaced. A decline in the monthly short interest figures is viewed as bearish by some analysts because they regard it as a reduction in the potential demand for stock. However, brokers noted there has been a surge in shorting activity since Sept. 13.
