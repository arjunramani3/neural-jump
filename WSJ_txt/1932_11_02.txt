rail shares, apparent morning, was converted general list in the final
Heaviness In the throughout yesterday into weakness in the hour of trading, and stocks sank back to levels
only slightly above those prevailing on October 10. the beginning of the trading range which has prevailed since that time. Volume picked up sharply in the final hour, and the ticker at one time lagged three miutes behind transactions. Losses at the close were heaviest in the rails, with maximum declines less than four points.
Bonds were heavy. While there was no concerted pressure on the market, overnight news of the receivership for the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway had a depressing effect. Weakness in stocks in the final hour terminated a minor rally in bonds. Cotton and wheat both closed unchanged after losing earlier gains.
Stocks were irregular at the opening, but through the morning they drifted higher. The rails, however, failed to share in the betterment, and as a result the list was only fractionally higher at noon. Declaration of the regular quarterly dividend of $1 by directors of Drug. Jnc.. brought a run-up in that stock, at	’
of
country has called for vigorous measures to protect banking institutions. Nevada’s 12-day business and backing holiday 1b one of them. News of the holiday undoubtedly caused some of the unsettlement In the markets on Tuesday, but fuller details of the situation allayed fears somewhat.
The 12 Wingfield banks, apparently the hardest hit, had deposits of roughly 515,000,000. The amount is certainly not a large one, in comparison with deposits in even small city institutions. Low prices for livestock have resulted in freezing loans made earlier in the year, when stock prices were better.
The difficulties of the farmers have meant serious troubles for bankers. Among institutions 'affected are the Joint Stock Land Banks and the Federal Farm Loan Banks, both of which are large holders of farm mortgages. With farmers unable to meet interest on their mortgages, and land sales, even at low prices, few and far between, directors of the banking institutions have faced an extremely difficult situation. If they dispossess present tenants for failure to meet mortgage interest, they cannot sell the land for any price at all. New tenants have little prospect of doing much better than the old ones, save for exceptional cases.
In addition, bankers have had to face pressure from bondholders for payment of interest on obligations of banking institutions.

Prices
High and Low
Wednesday, on tbe New York Chang-c, one stocks made
Norf^lTMt
It sold 33. against the opening of 3034, but the rest the list remained dull and heavy.
At the start of the final hour, the heaviness the rails became pronounced, and the whole
in	_
list gave way under renewed pressure. Delaware. Lackawanna & Western sold as low as 23%.. off 6% from the earlier high: Union Pacific, at 57 was down about 5. and Atchison fell to 35%. off about 5. Chesapeake & Ohio, New York Central and Southern Pacific were heavy, and Steel common, Telephone and Allied Chemical dipped with the rest of the market. A mild rally at the close erased some of the losses.
The Dow-Jones industrial average, at the close, was only fractionally above the October 10 figure. The rail average, however, still is about 1.70 points above the October 10 bottom.
In addition to the 'Frisco news, the rails were affected by further loadings reports f^nm individual carriers covering the week ended October 29. For most of the roads, traffic was down quite pronouncedly from the October 22 week.
Other business news included the mid-wcekly steel reviews, which put steel production at about the same	.	. .	.	-
recently. It was of new business put figures were the similar 1931 in the October 22 period, reflected the declines which have taken place recently. Declaration of the regular General Motors dividend, after the close, was no surprise.
British bonds moved forward on the London market. In Paris, the Bourse was dull and heavy.
rate that has been prevailing observed, however, that volume was slackening. Electric out-inconclusive. The decline from week held at the same level as Commodity indices
The 'Frisco Receivership
Appointment of a receiver for the St. Louts-San Francisco Railway failed to stir the railroad bond market importantly at the start o! trading yesterday. The ’Frisco bonds opened unchanged, and there was no important liquidation elsewhere in the second-grade rail bond list, although the tone of rail bonds was heavy
Receivership for the 'Frisco should stimulate deposits of bonds under the reorganization plan. So far only 64% of the bondholders affected have deposited their securities in favor of the proposal. With receivership an accomplished fact, bondholders may decide that they had better join in the effort to put through a reorganization plan voluntarily, rather than have a lengthy court adjudication, with attendant heavy expenditures. In assenting to the appointment of s receiver, after fighting off other efforts looking toward the same end, the management obviously had this in mind.
Receivership for the ’Frisco directs attention to the strenuous efforts of the Nickel Plate to obtain assent of the holders of its 6% notes to the refinancing plan suggested by the Interstate Commerce Commission, in approving a loan to the road from the Reconstruction Finance Corp. Deposits of the Nickel Plate notes are coming m slowly, and. including promises, now amount to about 81% of the principal amount outstanding.
Holdouts from the Nickel Plate plan apparently hope that a favored few may get par for their notes. There is certainly little chance that this will happen, for the Interstate Commerce Commission clearly indicated in its conditional approval of the loan to the Nickel Plato that it would not tolerate a repetition of what happened in the Cotton Belt refinancing. Holdcuts also apparently think it possible that some other plan for refinancing may be devised. The management of the Nickel Plate, however, 13 determined that the present plan *ls the only one that will be considered.
Nickel Plate noteholders arc in a poor position, because they are unsecured creditors of tho road and would be treated like any other unsecured creditors. If the plan goes througn, they get 25% in cash immediately and, for the balance, new notes with the same position in the company’s capital structure.
Upturn Brings Cheer t> Employe*
The railroad traffic turn brought at least temporary cheer to the .employes of the United States Freight Co., for salaries and wages, which had been cut in the spring, were restored to the previous level on September 1. The management's comment on the improved morale resulting from the restoration of the salary level is interesting. From a pure business point of view, the president declared, the restoration was justified.
