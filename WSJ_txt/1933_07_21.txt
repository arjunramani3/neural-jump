Xoss of Surcharges in Prospect
continuation of the railroad freight surcharges after September 30, when they are due to expire, is highly unlikely, and a good many railroad executives will be glad to get rid of them, even if it does mean some loss in revenue. Numerous railroad officials have contended throughout that the increased revenues from the surcharges which the carrier obtained, running to about 35,000,000 a month for all Class 1 railroads, did not tell the whole story, as the carriers were losing traffic which they would have obtained had the surcharges not been imposed.
For some roads, the loss, in revenues will be fairly large. If traffic continues on the present uptrend, it will not be felt. acutely. The big soft coal carriers, such as the Norfolk & Western and the Cheaspeake & Ohio, and the big eastern trunk lines, such as the New York Central and the Pennsylvania, will be the major losers. The Chesapeake & Ohio’s Income for 1932 was swelled by about $2,300,000 as result of revenues from the surcharges, and New York Central got 36,073,000 in additional income. While these were turned over to the Railroad Credit Corp.,, for distribution, among indigent roads to save them from receivership, the revenues were included as earnings in the carrier statements.
The surcharges collected in 1932 amounted to roughly $62,000,000, or just about 2% of the total gross revenues of Class 1 carriers. With traffic oh the rise, the .railroads can afford to lose that income.
The Brokers’ Loans Report
The brokers’ loans statement released yesterday did not reflect the large reduction in loans which must have taken place as result of the drastic reaction in stocks, Wednesday and Thursday. The loan figures reflected the condition of banks up to the close of business Tuesday, and they showed another increase, putting the total up to a new high of $967,000,000. On both Wednesday and Thursday there was a thorough-going house cleaning of marginal accounts, which should show up in next week's report on loans.
The further contraction in the amount of government securities purchased by the Federal Reserve merely was additional proof that the
Federal is shaping its buying operations to other factors. The large reduction in currency outstanding permitted the Federal to cut down purchases -of government securities to $10,000,000. Money in circulation now is down to $5,635,000,000, off $1,903,000,000 from the year’s high figure, set during the banking holiday in early March, and is at the lowest level since late January.
Wide Disparity in Earning Power'
Reports of the five subsidiaries of Drug, Ihc., which are to be reestablished as separate companies, showed the wide disparity in the earning powers of the individual units. The biggest earner was Sterling Products, Inc., while United Drug Co. was the only one of the five which was in the red for the full year. United Drug at the end of 1932 had current assets equal to about eight times current liabilities, with cash and marketable securities alone roughly five times current liabilities. Since the year-end, the company has been benefited by reductions in rentals, but the report on operations for tbe first five months of 1933, which should be out shortly, will show that United Drug is hot out of. its difficulties yet Lumber Orders Shrink
Lumber trade associations, in their weekly reports ot the condition of the industry, have declared often that they attributed some of sharp rise in lumber orders to a speculative demand from jobbers who were stocking up in anticipation of a rise in prices. Figures for the week ended July 15 tend to lndicatethat the trade associations’ conservatism in regard to the upswing in orders was justified.- Orders in the latest week fell below production for the first time in a year. Production still' is at a high rate, holding up as manufacturers hasten to fill the demand which has accumulated. With orders slackening somewhat, there should be-aifailing off in production m the not distant future.
The possibility of a lull In the general rise in production has been foreseen in many quarters. In many industries, speculative buying went a long way toward boosting the level of produotian. Inventories have been built up, and until consumer buying begin to make inroads on them they will not be Increased further. The motive behind the anxiety of jobbers to stock up has been the obvious fact that codes for many industries mean higher production costs and higher prices for goods.
Extent of the Decline
Measured by the Dow-Jones industrial average, the three-day precipitate drop in prices which has occurred is one of the most sevore in the history of the stock market. In three consecutive trading sessions, the Dow-Jones industrial average is down -JS.3% from the close on Tuesday, and the rail average, at last night’s finish, was off 18.1%, from Tuesday's close. In the three days, roughly 25,100,000 shares of stock have changed hands.
In the four trading sessions of October 23, 24, 28 and.29 in 1929, the Dow-Jones Industrial averages tumbled from 305.85 to 230.07, about the most rapid fall, both in number of points and on a percentage basis, in the history of the Exchange. In those four sessions, the Indus-

which broke out
Another deluge of selling, in the early afternoon following a drop of $6 a bale in cotton, swept stacks to new lows for the reaction yesterday, with many of the leading stocks off anywhere from 5 to 15 points at the lows. Heavy support orders came in late, bringing a sharp rally from the bottom. Once more, brokers were swamped with orders to get rid of stocks, and trading, volume picked up as the list fairly shot downward in the selling avalanche. Stop-loss orders were touched off on the decline, helping it along. Many stocks, in mid-afternoon, were selling for 50% or leas of the prices they commanded at the high on the recovery. Even-at the close, losses in the leaders ran up to around 9 points.	f
The heavy decline in stocks came swiitiy in the afternoon, after a relatively calm session in the morning, when stocks managed to hold steady, and some groups showed a little rallying power. The swift descent of cotton was the immediately unsettling factor, but the financial community also was disturbed by the news from Washington. Trading volume was terrific in the last two .hours. The tape lagged as much as 30 minutes behind the market in the last hour, and volume reached 9,570,000 shares, the largest since October 30, 1929.
Specialists had difficulty in making markets in active stocks. Orders were at the market, in most cases, as traders frantically tried to-get out. In one or two Instances, specialists had to close their books temporarily.
In the bond market, breaks were wide in speculative issues. In the railroad group, obligations of thei Chicago & North Western, the St Paul and other carriers were sent downward sharply. In some cases, losses were- almost as wide as in stocks.
The break in cotton occurred around 1:45 in the afternoon, with prices dropping $6 a bale from Thursday’s close. October, December and January sold under the 10-cent mark, and the decline was accelerated by the uncovering of stop loss orders. Recent buyers were free sellers. Late in the day, a rally wiped out more than half the losses, at the lows. Cotton rallied from the lows, closing down about $2.50 a bale.
