Stocks fell for the seventh straight trading day on Thursday, continuing what amounts to a slow-motion crash that has pulled the market down more than 20% over that brief period.
On its way down, the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through another milestone, closing below 9000 for the first time since 2003, wiping out the bulk of the gains from the last bull market. The decline leaves America in one of its worst bear markets in decades, a slump that is triggering comparisons to long-running declines of the 1930s and 1970s.
Thursday's decline -- the 11th largest in percentage terms in the Dow's history -- put the stock market either in, or nearly in, a crash. A common definition of a crash is a 20% decline in a single day or several days. The Dow's crash in 1987 was 22.6% in one day. The 1929 crash was back-to-back declines of 12.8% and 11.7%.
This week's relentless selloff has been driven by deepening fears about the banking system, and the spillover effects it may have on the rest of the economy. Investors were spooked on Thursday by a Standard & Poor's report raising the possibility that General Motors Corp.'s debt will be downgraded. Its stock fell 31%, closing at its lowest price since 1950, according to data from the University of Chicago.
In Asia Friday morning, Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average was down 11% in early trading and other markets were also down.
The market rout is rapidly wiping out vast amounts of wealth, casting a pall over households and businesses. U.S. stocks, as measured by the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000, shed $872 billion in market value on Thursday, $2.5 trillion over the last seven trading sessions, and $8.4 trillion since hitting an all-time high one year ago Thursday. The index includes almost all U.S. public companies.
Although the specific economic problems are different than in the 1970s or the 1930s, the markets are now behaving in a similar way. Although they rally, sometimes for extended periods, they eventually give back most of their gains as investor faith in a recovery fades.
"We are in a secular bear market," says Russ Koesterich, head of investment strategy at Barclays Global Investors in San Francisco, using Wall Street jargon for this kind of prolonged weak period. Analysts distinguish between long-running "secular" periods and shorter-term bear markets, such as the one that occurred from 2000 through 2002.
"We had a secular bear market from 1968 to 1982, and another that began in 1929," Mr. Koesterich says. Stocks sometimes mount strong rallies during the lengthy weak periods. They nearly doubled in value from 2002 through 2007, but have since given back most of those gains.
Mr. Koesterich thinks some kind of sharp rally may be coming, but maybe not right away. "It will take government intervention and some kind of coordinated government effort to recapitalize the banking system," he says. "And right now, that isn't working."
Thursday's trading dragged the Dow industrials down 678.91 points, or 7.33%, to 8579.19, the lowest finish since May 2003, and the largest one-day percentage decline since 1987. The index is down 39% since hitting a record 14164.53 one year ago. The size of the Dow's recent declines surpasses anything seen in the past two bear markets, and is the largest seven-session percentage drop since the days surrounding the 1987 crash.
As the day progressed, traders say, fear seemed to feed on itself, and people began selling stocks wholesale.
Some investors reacted badly to reports that the government is considering taking a direct financial holding in some major American banks -- a potential intervention intended to reassure the markets. The news fanned fears that the worst isn't over for the American banking system, and some investors are worried about bank failures.
The way some investors see it, if the government feels the need to intervene more drastically, the problem might be even larger than it had seemed. That kind of selfreinforcing fear is symptomatic of a secular bear market, where bearish sentiment trumps fundamentals.
"We've seen unprecedented intervention, and markets yawned it off. That shows how dire it is," says Greg Collins, chief executive of Fountain Hill Investments in Orlando, Fla.
"A lot of people are hopeful that this market will put in a bottom," he says. "Ultimately, they've been forced to get out of the way, because the selling pressure is so high.
Every time there has been strength in the morning, everyone says maybe we'll get some type of bounce." Instead, he says, "strength has just been an opportunity to sell.
Until we see some signs of stabilization, it is a trader's market."

During a long bullish period -- a secular bull market like the one between 1982 to 2000 -- investors become increasingly optimistic. They begin to ignore warning signals, pushing prices to unsustainable levels in the belief that stocks will remain strong for decades to come. Setbacks like the 1987 crash, which occurred early in that long bullish period, are remedied with unexpected speed, and before long optimism returns to markets. Investors treat dips as buying opportunities.
During long bear markets, that optimism is unwound. The process can take years, which is why secular bear markets can last for 14 years or longer, like the one from 1968 to 1982. Typically, such bear markets are accompanied by repeated economic disappointments, as excesses that developed during long periods of growth are unwound. That was true during the 1970s, and it seems to be the case now, although the underlying economic issues are different.
At the height of the 1990s bull market, the price of stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose to more than 30 times company profits, a record level that was more than twice the historical average. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the S&P 500 fell 49%, but its price-to-earnings ratio never fell to the historical average of 15 or 16.
To some market analysts, that meant stock values were still too high and investors were still too optimistic. During periods of stock- market weakness, price-to-earnings ratios eventually fall below their averages, sometimes into the high single digits, as they did during the last long-running bear market.
At Thursday's close, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 was down to 10.7, the lowest since the early 1980s.
During the 1970s -- a period of oil-price spikes, rampant inflation and double-digit interest rates -- the Dow industrials staged several strong rallies, but always fell back again. The index rose 32% from November 1971 through January 1973, reaching 1051.70, only to fall 45% over the next two years, according to Ned Davis Research. The Dow kept reaching the 1000 level and falling back. It didn't leave that milestone behind until 1982.
The 1930s were an even more devastating period for the economy. Stocks gave up most of their value between 1929 and mid-1932, before entering a period of ups and downs. Gains were erased by repeated setbacks. Analysts say that a long-running bull market didn't begin again until 1942.
One big difference this time around is that policy makers are thought to be using far more effective tools than they did in either the 1930s or the 1970s. That has led many investors to hope that the damage may not be as severe this time around. But the hope is muted by the fact that no one knows how deep the financial crisis will be.
