Market Views—	i
Discussing radio manufacturers. Laidlaw I & Co said: ‘They materially expanded facilities during the war, and many companies making radar equipment during that period have turned to the production of radios The . result is that there are now about 160 firms i in the field, compared with less than 60 firms before the war With Philco Corp. Radio Corp of America, Zenith Radio. General Electric and Emerson Radio A Phonograph accounting for more than 50r< of total sales before the war, it is apparent that the new companies, in an always highly competitive I field will have tough going with the end of the sellers’ market which apparently is not too far distant “	•	•	• Shearson.

trials and 27r<- (25 months i in the railroads So far as this writer is concerned, he does not think that thr present bear market should be as violent in the industrials (it already is as violent in the rails) as was the 1919-1921 bear market Furthermore, it is logical tn expect the correction to be shorter. To equal in extent the 1919-1921 decline, the industrials this time would have to go tn 113-114 My maximum bearish expectation is about 147-153 Of course all this i< guessing based on what appear to be resistance areas on the charts ”
