Stocks kicked off the fourth quarter with their steepest decline in three months as disappointing economic news sparked worries about what is to come.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 203 points, or 2.1%, to 9509.28, its third drop in a row and the sixth in seven trading days. All 30 components finished in the red, the first time that has happened since July 2.
The Nasdaq composite, which have rallied this year on hopes that tech stocks would lead the way out of recession, fell 3.1%.
As investors fled stocks, worried about employment data coming Friday and third-quarter earnings reports starting next week, they returned to some of the safest investments. Treasury prices rose as credit markets weakened, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year note slipped to 3.194%, the lowest since May 15. The dollar rallied against the yen and euro, pushing the U.S. Dollar Index up about 0.7%.
The S&P 500 fell 2.6% to 1029.85, like the Dow its biggest drop since July 2 and lowest close since Sept. 8. All sectors declined, led by financials, down 4.4%.
Thursday's action was the reverse of what happened in the third quarter, the best three months since 1998, when financials were the top performers and some of the riskiest stocks led the market higher. Both the Dow and the S&P finished up 15%.
"Everyone stopped calling for a correction -- that's why we are having one," said Scott J. Redler, strategist at T3Live.com, an online trading Web site. He said the first warning signs of a pullback came in late September, as the rally stalled even after the Federal Reserve expressed optimism about the economy.
Thursday's decline began at the opening bell and continued after the release of weak manufacturing data from the Institute for Supply Management. Initial claims for jobless benefits increased more than expected. The downturn picked up speed when Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for monthly jobs data due out Friday, saying it expects to see a decline of 250,000 jobs in U.S. nonfarm payrolls for September instead of 200,000.
Some investors also are beginning to place bets ahead of the third-quarter earnings season, which kicks off next week and mightn't see the sort of revenue growth needed to drive profits after gains driven by cost-cutting.
