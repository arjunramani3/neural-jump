the smallest reported so far this year, being only 30.8%.
However, individual railroad loading reports for the week ended February 27 indicate that the traffic of the country for that week will compare unfavorably with previous weeks. The Atchison made a decidedly unfavorable comparison and the New York Central Lines loaded 24.2% less freight in the week ended February 27 as compared with 1931, against a decline of only 22.0% for the preceding week.
Northern Pacific’s Dividend Problem Directors of the Northern Pacific Railway meet for action on the dividend at 2 o’clock the afternoon of March 23. In some quarters, there is uncertainty as to the maintenance of the current rate of 75 cents quarterly.
Northern Pacific reported a net operating deficit of approximately $555,000 in January.

Improving credit conditions throughout the world, as reflected in lower rediscount rates at numerous central banks, had an increasingly favorable effect on 'Wall Street sentiment yesterday. Further evidence of reviving stability in world finance was afforded in the arrangements of the British Treasury to repay on Friday the greater part of the $200,000,000 credit obtained in this market last August.
Moreover, it as generally believed that another cut in the Bank of England rate was imminent following the recent establishment of a 5% rediscount basis at that institution, against G% previously. With the brighter international prospects added to indications of thorough deflation at home, the principal stocks engaged in a broad, and fairly vigorous demonstration of strength.
Following several sessions in which the principal shares had drifted listlessly on an extremely small turnover, the gradual dcvelop-

Northern Pacific reported net income equal to $3.59 a share for 1931. Included in the total was a special dividend of $5,000,000 from the Northwest Improvement Co. and $644,080 in tax refunds.

Homblower & Weeks Forecast Bull market
In a special wire to clients, Homblower &. Weeks expressed the opinion that a bull market was in the making. "We would buy stocks.” the message said. “We anticipate a period of accumulation incident to the beginning of a bull market-	. ., nniv to si 32 a share on the common.
“Indeed, we may be said to be already in the only to 5^.*	on

draw on its cash resources to the extent of S3,-775,541 to meet the dividend payment. While the road still is m very good financial shape, it cannot continue to draw on its cash to meet dividends unless there are clear indications that traffic is improving. So far. there are no indications of a sustained traffic pickup in the Burlington territory, although the February statement will be better than that for March, when fixed charges were just about covered.
Directors of the Burlington will not meet for dividend action until the latter part of May or early June. It is too early now to make any estimate of what the Burlington will show for the year, and it may be that by May a substantial traffic pickup will have occurred.
Reading Hit by Warm Weather
Due to continued mild weather and failure of industry and business to revive, the Reading Co got off to a bad start in 1932. and outlook is for another poor showing in February. Bituminous shipments have been curtailed by the low rate of operations m the iron and steel trade as well as industry in general. It had been anticipated that with normal weather anthracite shipments would help to offset the drop m soft coal, but unduly high temperatures which prevailed during the entire month of January, resulted in a very poor hard coal movement as well. Within the last week the old line companies have reduced their prices at the mines which mav serve to move coal somewhat faster, nut the normal winter business has been lost because of the unusually mild season

These problems ultimately will be solved and while awaiting their solution, we shall undoubtedly see periods of reaction. In the past, it has always been during periods of alternate rallies and reactions in stock market prices, that important accumulation took place Meanwhile. we are on the threshold of spring, when regardless of major trends, the business of the country usually enjoys a seasonal improvement in volume, starting with crop preparations and outdoor activities.
“To say the very least, the risk of purchasing securities under existing circumstances seems minimum. We. therefore urge some immediate purchases of sound securities and additional purchases during any periods of irregularity or recession in coming weeks ”
Steel Trade Show s Revival
Weekly steel reviews offered some evidence of graduallv awakening demands, but continued to try the'patience of those looking for more decided improvement. Current operations did no better than hold to the previous week’s level, according to Iron Age. while the Dow-Jones compilation recorded pacity

Carloadings figures lor the week ended February 20, showing a gain over the preceding week of 10,141 cars, came as a surprise to the Street, the Tuesday afternoon rumor having been that the total would be below the figure for the preceding week.

'revenues, but net operating income will have the benefit of the 10% wage reduction which went into effect February 1. Latest estimates indicate that the 10% reduction will amount to upwards of $3,250,000 per annum, or at an average monthly rate of roundly $270,000. Apart from the 10% wage reduction, the Reading has put into effect various measures which have increased efficiency and resulted in economies in operation which will quickly be reflected 1 in net returns once business starts to pick up I This means that a substantial part of any material increase in gross will be carried through 'to net operating income.
