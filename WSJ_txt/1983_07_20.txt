Volcker’s Ml Statement Ignites , Sharp Rally in
MARKET DIARY
By Victor J. Hillery
Relief on the interest rate front ignited an explosive stock market rally that propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 30.74 points yesterday, its biggest gain in more than 7% months. Volume surged to nearly 110 million shares, the highest in four weeks.
The industrial average closed at 1227.86; its leap yesterday was the sharpest since a 36.43-point gain last Nov. 30.
Analysts ascribed the eruption to the announcement by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker that the Fed will try to hold growth of Ml. the basic money supply, to a 5%-to-9% range for the rest of the year; that compares with the 4%-to-8% range during 1983’s first half. He told the House Banking Committee that the Fed looks toward "substantially slower, but not a reversal, of Ml growth,” which would enhance rather than diminish prospects for sustained economic growth and lower interest rates.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average spurted 15.37 points to 575.37, and the utility indicator climbed 2.12 points to 132.32, a 1983 record.
Indicative of the upswing’s broad move were the more than 1,300 New York Stock Exchange issues that advanced, four times the losers.
“Obviously the exuberance was due to Mr. Volcker’s testimony, which laid to rest fears of tighter money and higher interest rates,” commented L. Crandall Hays, vice president of Robert W. Baird & Co.. Milwaukee.
“The upturn was so strong and the volume so great that the correction probably has been broken,” Mr. Hays asserted. “The market recently had reached an oversold condition for the first time in about a year."
“What Mr. Volcker did was remove the uncertainty about the outlook that has been keeping the buyers out of the market.” contended James C. Andrews, vice president of Janney Montgomery Scott, Philadelphia. He added, however, that “we’re still cautious until we see whether the Fed’s policy is going to work.”
“The buyers came pouring out of the woodwork because they were convinced the Fed isn’t going to tighten so much as to abort the economic recovery,” asserted Peter Treadway, senior vice president and economist at Cralin & Co. "The Fed probably has tightened as much as it intends to for now because it must serve three masters: the monetary aggregates, the economic recovery and the international situation.”
“The worry that the Fed would close down the growth of the basic money supply seems to have evaporated," observed Eldon A. Grimm, senior vice president at Birr, Wilson & Co. "The Fed is going to allow a certain amount of growth over the balance of the year.”
Big Board volume swelled to 109,310,000 shares from 74,030,000 on Tuesday and was the highest since turnover of 110,366,770 on June 22. The expansion of institutional activity was reflected in the climb in trades of 10,000 shares or more to 2,040 from 1,181 the prior session.
The technology issues racked up sizable gains, part of which was attributed to short covering, or buying of stock to replace borrowed shares sold earlier. Motorola jumped 9% to 140%. Data General climbed
