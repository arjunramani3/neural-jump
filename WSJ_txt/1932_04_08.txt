States Steel common finally broke through its previous low of the year. Since the beginning of the current week there has been no evidence of the same character of buying which caused so much discussion a week ago. The theory is that the oversubscription for stock by employes resulted in the corporation buying its own stock under 40, and this demand is credited with having been a factor In making Steel common act stubbornly at times. However, since the issue has declined so Bharply this week, the opinion is expressed that the so-called inside buying has been completed. Because of the sentimental influence of Steel common on outsiders, the stock continues to be watched closely. Any technical rally probably would find Steel out among the leaders, despite the poor trade conditions and prospects. There is an appreciable short interest in the stock.
.Rediscount Rate
Unchanged
Anticipations of the pessimists became a reality yesterday when the industrial average went through the low of 1921. This was a signal to increase the supply as new stops were reached and the market was reactionary during the greater part of the session. New weak features were uncovered, reflecting necessitous selling in some issues. Demand was confined to short covering, which was not urgent, and aside from causing a mild rally in the late afternoon, this buying was without influence. General Motors was one of the pivotal shares which attracted attention by its weakness. Selling was quite heavy after publication of the sales figures for March which were under predictions heard in the financial district recently. A reaction occurred after the late rally, but leading shares were only slightly above the lows of the day.
There has been no evidence of support coming into the market as yet. Therefore conservative observers continue their policy of keeping clients on the side lines. They still favor using all rallies to reduce long commitments.
Trading About Evenly Divided
Commission houses reported continued, selling, but there was outside short covering which about equalled the supply. Professionals and floor traders were on both sides of the market. Many were evening accounts by covering shorts for the week-end, but this was offset by new selling which came as lower prices were established.
Selling Climax Approaching
The belief Is growing In many quarters that a selling climax is approaching, because volume has been increasing recently and more stocks have entered new low territory. Among the developments which would indicate a climax would be a further increase in activity to between 2,500,000 and 3,000,000 shares la one ses-: sion, a larger number of new lows, a negligible i number of advances in the price table, and an acceleration in the rate of decline.
Various Factors Affect Market	’
Various unfavorable factors which seem to be affecting the market include: non-appearance of a spring revival in business activity, prospects of unfavorable earnings for the first quarter, with no sign of improvement in the second three months, and the likelihood of further dividend omissions or reductions. A further unsettling influence recently has been the uncertainty over the tax legislation and what effect it will have on business and the stock market.
Urging Shorts to Be Cautious
Conservative observers in the past few days have been urging shorts to be more cautious. This tendency has been responsible for some of the covering encountered during reactions. It was this covering which gave some resistance to the market during Belling waves, although on several occasions there was evidence that the pessimists were not willing to bid for stocks during rallies. As soon as. recoveries occurred the larger shorts withdrew from the buying side, only to resume covering on a scale during subsequent reactions. If the short covering becomes more urgent and follows stocks on rallies, a good technical recovery would develop.
U. S. Steel's Action—(X)
After having shown good signs of support during the early part of last week, United
The rediscount rate of the New York Federal Reserve Bank was continued unchanged at 3%, although many anticipated early this week that a reduction might be made. Some of the short covering late on Thursday waq based on the possibility of such action causing a rally in the stock market.
American Can Sold On Low Suits—(AC)
American Can was driven to new low levels this week on selling which followed announcement that legal actions were being brought against the company by some consumers of cans. The Can company is planning to contest these actions actively and officials of the company are said to be confident they will be victorious. The first selling in the shares came from professionals and traders who follow news developments of an unfavorable nature closely and who have been successful in putting out other stocks under somewhat similar conditions. As the lower prices were being reached stop orders were uncovered, increasing the supply often considerably.
Scale Buying In United Gua Improvement—(UGI)
On many occasions in the past few weeks United Gas Improvement has acted much better than other issues in the utility group, but there has been some selling in the shares in sympathy with the weakness elsewhere. In market circles it is contended that there had been scale buying in U. G. I. based on the satisfactory report for 1931 and on the growing belief that the company will resume its upward trend in profits as soon as improvement in basic conditions takes place. Some time ago there was accumulation in the stock, and it is said that the important interests who had bought at somewhat higher levels have been maintaining their holdings.
Consolidated Gas Stops Reached—(G)
Short selling increased in Consolidated Gas recently, accompanied by talk of the increased charges which must be met by the company as a result of the sale of $60,000,000 in debentures ten months ago. This supply came at a time when the general market was reactionary and had the effect of reaching prices at which nearby stop orders had been in the market. It is maintained in some commission houses that public liquidation in Consolidated Gas in the past few days has been larger than in some time, but that this was due entirely to the practice of holders in using stops for protection.
