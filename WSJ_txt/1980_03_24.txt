Industrials Drop to 23-Month Low As Interest Rates Cause Broad Slide
By Victor J. Holby
Rising interest rates helped send the stock market into a sweeping retreat that carried the Dow Jones industrial average to its lowest level in almost two years. But trading was only moderately active.
With recently strong oil issues leading the slide, the industrial average tumbled 19.71 points to 765.44, its lowest level since it closed at 763.95 April 6, 1978. The transportation and utility indexes also were down sharply.
“Short-term interest rates have turned around and headed back up," commented L. Crandall Hays, vice president of Robert W. Baird & Co., Milwaukee.
“Many money managers decided to step back and catch their breath when they saw the industrial average drop below the 780 level,” asserted Dick S. Falk Jr., head trader at Paine Webber. Mitchell Hutchins. Technicians had regarded the 780 level as "an important resistance area”; it marked the bottom of declines in November 1978 and October 1979.

The industrial average’s 19.71-point setback was the second recent big drop; the indicator slid 23.04
points March 17.
More than 1,500 New York Stock Exchange issues finished lower yesterday, more than 11 times the gainers.
Noting that this
Abreast of tbe Market
the third recent
session in which more than 90% of the is-
sues ended in the loss column, Mr. Hays said that usually after three such lopsided sessions the market shows some technical bounce.
However. Alfred W. Harris Jr., research director at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., St. Louis, asserted that “after breaking through the 780 level the market probably will be in for some difficulty over the near term.” He added that the "intense competition of the high yields currently available on money-market instruments is drawing money away from stocks."
Mr. Falk of Paine Webber said that some margin account investors, who use brokers' loans to carry part of their stocks, were selling "because of the current high margin costs and because they were getting close to margin calls." When a customer's equity in a margin account falls below a stipulated level he is asked to put up more cash or sell some of his holdings.
Other Contributing Factors
Also weighing on the market, analysts said, were the expected announcement today of a high consumer price index figure for February; the increased tension in the Middle East caused by the flight of the deposed shah of Iran to Egypt, and the difficulties being encountered by First Pennsylvania Corp.
One favorable aspect of yesterday's action, analysts also contended, was the "lack of panic selling.” Big Board volume, heaviest in the final hour, rose to 39,230,000 shares from 32,220,000 Friday. Slightly greater institutional activity was indicated by the increase in trades of 10,000 shares or more to 448 from 435 in the previous session. ■
The action of International Business Machines' stock also prompted some wariness among investors. In active trading, the issue fell to 54%, its lowest level since 1975, and then closed at 54%, off 2%.
Among the oil, Mobil slid 3% to 67% in active trading. Gulf dropped 2 to 38%; Exxon, 1% to 57, and Charter, 2% to 20%, all in active trading. Charter's talks aimed at the purchase of an Occidental Petroleum subsidiary recently broke off.
Other oil casualties included Superior, down 6% to 127%; Cities Service, 2 to 88%;
Marathon, 1% to 56%; Shell, 3 to 62; Standard Oil (Ohio), 6% to 82; Indiana Standard, 4% to 96%; Standard Oil of California, 3% to 66%, and Sun, 4% to 69.
General Public Utilities topped the actives and slid 1% to 4%. Analysts noted recent adverse publicity about the extent of the damage at its Three Mile Island nuclear plant plus unfavorable comment about the stock on television's "Wall Street Week.” A 250,000-share block handled by Shearson Loeb Rhoades Inc. moved at 3%.
First Pennsylvania Corp, eased % to 4% in active trading. The company’s earnings have been hurt by the rise in interest rates, and it has been the subject of rumors of a federal "rescue" perhaps by a merger.
NCR Skids
NCR skidded 8% to 55%; it announced recently that its first quarter profit will trail the year-earlier level. UNC Resources slipped 1% to 15; the diversified energy company omitted'its dividend and predicted a loss for the current fiscal year.
Norin climbed 3% to 20%; an agreement in principle was announced under which Canadian Pacific Investments Ltd. would acquire Norin for $32 a share, or about $76 million.
K man supped 1 to 17%; a 750,000-share block handled by Goldman Sachs traded at 17%. First Boston mostly handled a 257,-000-share trade of PepsiCo at 20%; it ended at 24%. off %.
American Home Products fell 1% to 21%; a 130,000-share block handled by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette moved at 22.
The American Stock Exchange index dropped 11.61 to 241.17 and losers led by better than seven to one. Turnover quickened to 4.740,000 from 3,370,000 Friday.
Oil and technology stocks paced big losers on the Amex. Gulf Canada was active and dropped 7% to 121; Amdahl fell 2 to 18%, and Paradyne, a data communications equipment company, skidded 4 to 26% after announcing that it had terminated talks on the acquisition of Computer Systems & Engineering Ltd. of England.
Cubic dropped 4% to 15%; the electronics and elevator company attributed the stock's weakness to a bearish report, which it didn't identity, on the company.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index dropped 4.19 to 134.61, a low for the year, with losers overwhelming gainers 1,304 to 109. Volume increased to 16,979,600 shares from Friday’s 13,735,900.
