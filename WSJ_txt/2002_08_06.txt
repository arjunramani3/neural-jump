"The market is so emotionally charged right now" and investors are so unsure of its direction, that it is subject to sharp swings, said Keith Gertsen, head of Nasdaq trading at brokerage firm Deutsche Bank Securities. "The volatility of the Dow is unlike anything I have ever seen. It is trading like a Nasdaq Internet stock of the late 1990s."
Also propping up stocks was the recent strength of the dollar, as its recent declines had provoked fears of foreign withdrawals from U.S. stocks. And once stocks began to rise, the actions of short sellers contributed to the gains. Short sellers are investors who bet on stock declines by borrowing stock and selling it, in hopes of profiting by buying it back at a cheaper price. When the market turned up, some short sellers took the profits they had made from recent stock declines, and to do so they had to buy stock -- helping to extend the rally.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.61%, or 0.64 point, to 106.11.

AFTER THREE DAYS of heavy declines, stocks reversed course sharply, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 3% as investors clung for a day to positive rumors instead of negative ones.
Amid predictions that the Federal Reserve could cut its interest-rate target in an effort to boost the economy again, the Dow industrials surged as much as 374.52 points during the day, before a sharp pullback in the last hour left the blue chips up 230.46 points, or 2.9%, at 8274.09.
"The market is so emotionally charged right now" and investors are so unsure of its direction, that it is subject to sharp swings, said Keith Gertsen, head of Nasdaq trading at brokerage firm Deutsche Bank Securities. "The volatility of the Dow is unlike anything I have ever seen. It is trading like a Nasdaq Internet stock of the late 1990s."
In four trading days from July 24 through July 29, the industrial average rose more than 1,000 points. The first and last of those days marked the two biggest single-day percentage gains of the year. Then, just a few days later, the industrials went into a tailspin, giving up nearly 700 points in the three days through Monday.
Now, stocks have surged again.
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.4%, or 53.54 points, to 1259.55, its fourth-biggest percentage gain of the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3%, or 24.97 points, to 859.57.
The market surged initially amid rumors, which proved false, that the Federal Reserve was holding an emergency meeting to cut interest rates. The rumors were supplanted by talk, supported by recent forecasts from economists at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Lehman Brothers, that by year-end the Fed could push its target rate to as low as 1% from the current 1.75%, perhaps beginning with a quarter-point cut at its regular policy meeting Tuesday.
Also propping up stocks was the recent strength of the dollar, as its recent declines had provoked fears of foreign withdrawals from U.S. stocks. And once stocks began to rise, the actions of short sellers contributed to the gains. Short sellers are investors who bet on stock declines by borrowing stock and selling it, in hopes of profiting by buying it back at a cheaper price. When the market turned up, some short sellers took the profits they had made from recent stock declines, and to do so they had to buy stock -- helping to extend the rally.
As the day wore on, attention turned to Cisco Systems on rumors that the computer-networking company, which reported earnings after regular trading hours, would offer an upbeat view of the rest of the year. Then, just before the final bell, a separate rumor began that Cisco's outlook would be negative, and that helped spark a wave of late-day profit-taking that erased about one-third of the day's gain.
Cisco's actual results were neither as good as the optimists hoped nor as bad as the pessimists feared. It posted higher quarterly earnings due to cost cutting and tripled its stock-buyback program, but it said its customers remain cautious and its market, "challenged."
In after-hours trading, its stock rose nearly 8% to $13.03. Cisco is viewed as such a bellwether by tech investors that the market's direction for the rest of the week could be influenced by how investors digest Cisco's report.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.61%, or 0.64 point, to 106.11.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.52 billion shares traded, 2,382 stocks rose and 832 fell.
Bonds declined. The 10-year Treasury note fell 30/32, or $9.375 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to 4.333%. The 30-year bond was down 31/32 to yield 5.234%.
The dollar strengthened. Late in New York, it traded at 120.87 yen, up from 119.61, while the euro fell against the dollar to 96.66 cents from 98.19.
