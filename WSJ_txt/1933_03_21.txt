7On^ stock aver-
$6,500,000,000, are extremely low. Refinancing even a part of it on a long-term basis would entail higher interest rates, at a time when the government is trying to cut down its expenditures. On the other hand, the advantages of thawing out banks, to the extent that they are relieved of some of their Treasury obligations, and long-term debt in the hands of the public is substituted, would be very great.
Big Trade
In Tuesday’s dullness, one large transaction stood out. That was a sale of 15,000 shares of Willys-Overland at ’4, the low. At that price, the stock is. selling at & little less than one-fifteenth of the" 1932 high, almost a record in shrinkage.
How They Stand
Earnings reports of leading companies, compared with those for the corresponding period a year previous, and dividend declarations compared with the previous declarations, follow. Companies reporting on a monthly basis are
Selling- in individual stocks, particularly in the utilities, brought a further decline in the price level on the Stock Exchange yesterday. From the outset the market had a heavy tone, and prices slipped off steadily throughout the day. with the list turning weak in the last hour. Intermittent periods of recovery occurred, but they were of brief duration. Losses in some exceeded 3 points.
The rails held well throughout the morning, but they dropped abruptly in the afternoon. Delaware & Hudson broke abruptly, and closed at 52%, off 3% and down around 6 points from the recent recovery high. Union Pacific was depressed by the poor ^report for February, showing a drastic shrinkage in operating income.
The market was dull in the morning, but the trading pace picked up in the last hour, when stocks turned weak. Volume for the day totaled 1,210,000 shares, against 780,000 Monday.
The market for bonds was a confused affair. High-grade railroad issues managed to move up a trifle. The rest of the domestic corporation list was lower, and government bonds declined. Strength in the foreign bond division was R-n early feature of trading, but later in the session some of the strength went out of the group.
W ashington news was devoid of any Items calculated to stir the markets. Waif Street still is in the dark on the details of the administration’s railroad program, but expressed its hopefulness that it would he constructive by purchasing rail shares on all recessions. A number of factors contributed to the sell-off in the utilities. One of these was Governor Lehman’s special message to the state legislature, asking amendment of state laws to prevent “abuses.” Threats of rate cuts also continue to be a factor m 'depressing Xhe utility stocks.
Through the morning, stocks drifted downward. and by noon losses, ran to more than a point in some of the active issues. These included Telephone^ Consolidated Gas and American Tobacco B. Shortly after noon, the rails staged a mild recovery movement, but this faded and in the afternoon the market drifted off again. Utilities were the chief targets.
Among the utilities which suffered the heaviest losses were Consolidated Gas. which closed down 3i4 at 44 ’4 : North American, which lost 1”m, and Detroit Edison, which dropped 5 points following the reduction in the quarterly dividend tn Si from SI.50. A difficult market existed in Commonwealth & Southern preferred, and a sale was negotiated after the aid of the ticker had been invoked at 25, off 4 4?. Other utility preferred stocks were weak.
Commodities gave no encouragement to the stock market. Wheat closed down to cent a bushel, only slightly above the lows. Cotton closed at the lows, off SI.25 to Si 50 a bale.
Foreign markets were mixed In London, prices were a shade better, with mining shares strong Britibh funds were higher.
Itocweielt’s Iluilroad Vleuh
The chief interest of the financial community lies currently in the direction of finding out the details of the President’s program for the railroads. While so far most of Wall Street is in the dark as to the concrete proposals which will be made, the President’s railroad views were expounded fully in one of his most important campaign speeches, his address at Salt Lake City. In that speech, Mr. Roosevelt stated definitely that he favored announcement by the Government that it would stand back of the railroads for a specified period. Such Government support of the carriers would he conditioned, the President said, on readjustment of top-h6avy railroad capital structures where necessary. He favored pressing consolidations, where they are m the public interest: regulation of competing motor carriers: elimination of non-paying mileage, and regulation of holding companies.
On those broad premises, the Administration’s program will be drawn. Reports from Washington indicate that the Administration Is leaning toward wider consolidations than hitherto contemplated. The savings made possible by such consolidations would be enormous, and certainly justify the move.
Mullins Weak Again
Mullins preferred was weak again Tuesday. In active trading for this issue, the stock dropped down to around 5. In two trading sessions, the value of the shares has been cut in half. Mullins, only about two years ago, was a trading favorite, and the common was whirled upward to the accompaniment of a wide variety of rumors as to its earnings’ outlook. Last year was difficult for the company, as it was for all companies dependent on the motor industry for their major income.
Government Financing
Indications that the government may embark on a campaign of refinancing aroused widespread interest. The Liberty Loan Fourth 4%s are callable this year, as are the First 4^8. The former arc outstanding to a total of $6,268,000,000, and the latter issue amounts to $532,000,000. Refinancing of even a part of these two issues on a lower interest basis would mean a substantial saving to the government in Interest payments annually, and would be another step toward balancing the budget. The government contemplates, in Its refinancing endeavors, issuance of small denomination bonds, which would bring money out of hoarding and would get the now Issue into the hands of investors.
As far as refinancing the unwieldy amount of short-term Treasury obligations goes, the government is in a difficult situation. Interest rates on most of this debt, which totals about
