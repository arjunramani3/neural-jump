Stocks gave back all of Wednesday's gains and then some amid growing worries about job losses and the weak economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 215.45 points, or 2.5%, at 8376.24. General Motors led the decliners, falling 16% as executives of Detroit's three auto makers pleaded with Congress for government aid.
Exxon Mobil slid 3.4% and Chevron fell 4% as oil prices fell.
Grim news about layoffs and the economy began early in the day. Government data showed claims for unemployment benefits lasting more than one week were at the highest level in 26 years. AT&T said it would eliminate 12,000 jobs. Retailers reported that November sales were the weakest in many years.
Analysts expect that Friday's employment report for November will show an 11th month in a row of job losses, with some estimates for the decline in nonfarm payrolls as high as 500,000.
"There's been a lot of skittishness ahead of any and all economic data that have come out over the last few weeks," said trader Ryan Detrick of Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. "The signs we're seeing are about as deflationary as can be," he said, referring to widespread weakness in prices of goods and services that could make it difficult to jolt the global economy back to life.
Major stock indexes bounced between modest gains and losses before steady declines began in mid-afternoon and picked up speed toward the close. They came off their lows for the day in the last few minutes of trading.
The Standard & Poor's 500 finished down 2.9% to 845.22, led by a 6.8% drop in its energy sector as crude futures tumbled to $43.67 barrel, the lowest price since January 2005.
Concerns about the effects of a steadily weakening economy also put pressure on technology stocks. Intel fell 6.5%. Apple was down 4.7%.
Investors continued to flock to the safety of Treasury bonds, sending prices higher and yields lower. The yield on the 30-year bond slid to 3.082%.
