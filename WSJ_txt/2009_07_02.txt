An unexpectedly gloomy jobs report heightened anxiety that the economy mightn't be recovering as well as expected, prompting investors to sell stocks and commodities and flee to haven investments.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.6%, the biggest decline ahead of a July 4 holiday in at least 50 years. The Dow closed at 8280.74, down 223.32 points, its lowest close since May 22 and the third consecutive week of declines. The New York Stock Exchange extended trading for 15 minutes at the end of the day because of a computer glitch.
Investors also abandoned commodities, reflecting the diminished optimism for economic growth and demand for raw materials. Crude slumped $2.58, or 3.7%, to $66.73 a barrel.
Instead, investors sought the relative safety of U.S. Treasurys and the U.S. dollar. The benchmark 10-year Treasury added 14/32 to 96 30/32, pushing down the yield to 3.494%. The dollar gained 1% against the euro and changed hands at 1.40 per euro late Thursday.
The 467,000 jobs lost in June surprised investors and fueled worries about the strength of the economy. After soaring from a low reached on March 9, stocks had plateaued. The jobs report came on the eve of earnings season, which begins next week with the report of Alcoa. Analysts have begun to worry that, even with the recent decline, stock investors may be overly optimistic about a second-half recovery.
"Everyone was waiting for these job numbers," said Jonathan Corpina, a senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners. "We were kind of hoping for them to be a little better," he said, adding that other economic data "had been trending in the right direction. But deep inside, we know it's a long process. Hopefully, this is just kind of a minor setback."
The S&P 500-stock index shed 26.91, or 2.9%, to 896.42. All of its industry groups fell, with the energy, consumer-discretionary, financial, and industrial sectors logging the sharpest losses, off more than 3%.
Some said Thursday's declines could be short-lived.
The jobs number "was not good, and that does have significant negative implications for the economy," said David Chalupnik, head of equities at First American Funds in Minneapolis, with $80 billion under management. But he said earnings should beat expectations, and companies will soon begin to rebuild inventories. "That's not a bad scenario for the market," he said.
