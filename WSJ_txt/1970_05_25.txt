Abreast of the Market
Stocks Plunge Again; Industrial Index Off 20.81, Almost Equaling Drop on the Day Kennedy Died
The industrial average plunged 20.81 points lo 641.36, almost equaling its drop of 21.16 points on Nov. 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was shot. At its close it was at the lowest level since it finished at 640.14 on Dec. 18, 1982.
A total of 911 issues on the New York Stock Exchange set 1970 lows.
Trading volume on the Big Board rose to 12,660,000 shares from 12,170,000 Friday. The pace picked up during the afternoon and at the close the Big Board price quotation ticker was two minutes late in reporting trades on the floor of the exchange.
“Bad news continued to demoralize stockholders,” commented one broker. Others said the uncertainty about the economic outlook, with the nation caught between slowing business activity and continuing inflation, was amounting to a "crisis of confidence.” Added to these worries was concern about the domestic ramifications of the Cambodian campaign and the heightening of tension in the Mideast. “Whether or not these worries are justified, they are all factored into the market,” stated one broker.
.Other Averages Slump
The transportation average skidded 5.38 points to 133.87, its lowest closing since it hit 132.72 on Nov. 20, 1962. And the utility indicator, finishing at 98.73, down 1.79 points, was the lowest since it ended at 98.71 on Dec. 23, 1960.
Stocks finishing lower overwhelmed gainers on the Big Board by more than a ten-toone margin, with 1,370 issues down and 130 up. The mammoth total of 911 new lows compared with 519 Friday. As on Friday, no stock traded at a 1970 high.
Discussing the economic prospects at a Congressional hearing yesterday. Treasury Secretary Kennedy conceded there is some doubt whether corporate profits this year would reach the $89 billion on which budget estimates are based. And Budget Director Robert Mayo said that the $1.8 billion budget deficit expected for the fiscal year ending June 30 was due to lower-than-anticipated corporate tax collections and that the estimated $1.3 billion deficit for the next fiscal year, starting July 1, is “entirely due to softness in the economy since January."
One big generator of uncertainty, brokers said, was the developing battle over demands for wage, price and profit controls to combat inflation. Democratic leaders yesterday urged the Administration to consider the imposition of controls. Senate Majority Leader Mansfield stated there has been a “severe loss of public confidence in the economy” and that the stock market decline “portends worse things to come.” Joining the chorus, Lionel D. Edie & Co., an economic consulting firm, said preferable confidence markets.”
However, Secretary Kennedy said he sees "no need for (standby wage-price powers) at the present time.” He asserted that the simultaneous worries about recession and inflation "are almost positive proof that the economy is adjusting to a less inflationary condition." He also said he thinks “we are at the peaks now” in interest rates. David Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, said he is "strongly opposed” to any Government action "carried to the point of all-out wage and price controls.”
Budget Director Mayo also commented yesterday that he thinks “the stock market will find a new level and make its own adjustments” just as the economy is making its adjustments.
Margin Calls Heavy
Contributing to the pressure yesterday were heavy margin calls being sent out to customers by brokerage houses. Customers with credit accounts were being asked to put up more cash or sell securities where their cash levels in the accounts fell below minimum standards. Banks also were sending out calls for additional collateral on loans to individuals because of the diving stock prices.
Another depressant on stock prices was the weakness of the bond market. Prices of long-term U.S. Government bonds skidded as much as two full points and prime corporates % point.
Prices also were down sharply on the
wage and price controls "appear to highly disruptive inflation, a crisis and anarchy in the money
