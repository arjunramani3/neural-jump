After swinging about erratically most of yesterday's session, stocks moved generally higher in the final hour of trading, pivotal issues closing anywhere from a fraction to 4 points higher on the day. Bonds rallied In the early afternoon, the more speculative Issues regaining most of their earlier losses. Commodities did better, wheat closing _	- -	.
a bushel. Cotton,' after ‘selling bale, regained the lost ground unchanged.
stocks covered a wide range and changes from weakness to firmness were abrupt. The market opened irregularly higher and pushed forward during the first half hour of trading, with volume in'the first half hour 500,000 shares, against 300,000 shares Wednesday. The trend was reversed Bwiftly, and pivotal issues lost ground rapidly as a wave of selling swept over the market. American Telephone got down to 107, “U. S. Steel to 33%, and losses elsewhere ranged from a fraction to 2 or 3 points.
Support Met at the Lown
Support was met at the lows, and a brisk rally ensued. American Telephone ran up very easily, moving ahead from 108% to 110 in a string of four transactions. The stock sold at 110 Immediately after a transaction of 109%, a jump of three-quarters of a point. Activity died down in the early afternoon, but picked up again in the final hour, when the day's best levels were reached. The steel stocks and the rail shares led the late advance. American Telephone closed more than four points above the day's low; Steel about three points above its bottom price, and gains were liberal elsewhere in the list-
The day’s business news was inconclusive. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted another Increase in commodity prices in the week ended September 10, the index advancing a third of a point over the figure for the previous week. Steel scrap prices were somewhat easier at Youngstown, but in iHttsburgh the advance has continued, with a gain of 25 cents a ton m the past week chalked up. The Sears-Roebuck sales report for the four weeks ended September 10 recorded a decline from the like 1931 weeks of about the same percentage as for the 36 weeks ended September 10 from the similar 1931 period. However, sales in the latest four weeks recorded a much sharper advance from the total for the four weeks ended August 14 than did sales for the September 14 period in 1931 over the preceding four weeks figures.
Bond Market Slakes Better Showing
Wall Street is inclined to watch the bond market closely, and yesterday's performance was much better than in previous recent sessions. While the Dow-Jones average of 40 domestic issues closed oft a small fraction on the day, this was due entirely to the second grade rail issues. The averages of the first grade rails, the public utilities and the-industrials all closed higher on the day.
The markets abroad were lower. In London, stocks weakened, but British funds wore higher. Rentes were firm in Paris, but the rest of the list on the Paris Bourse was down.
Brokers’ loans, for the week ended September 14, advanced $62,000,000 to a total of $433,000,000.' Brokers’ loans now axe $102,000,000 above the low, set July 27. The increase was the largest week-to-week gain scored since the week ended July 1, 1931, when brokers* loans shot up $73,000,000. During the period covered by the latest figures, the stock market, as measured by the Dow-Jones industrial average, declined 7.43 points to 69.85.
Erie Anthracite Loadings Gain
The Erie Railroad's showing so far this year hardly has been calculated to stir enthusiasm, but the road, in many respects, has done better than other carriers. While gross revenues for the seven months ended July were down to $42,682,120, off roughly $11,600,000 from the like seven months of 1931, the road waa able to report net operating income of $4,122,345, against $6,671,429. Compared with the showing of New York Central, for instance, the Erie’s results are not bad. Net operating income of the Central for the seven months was down' to roughly $7,300,000, against approximately $19,500,000 for the like 1931 months.
Erie’s coal traffic forms a backlog to support its earning power, and in both July and August the road’s anthracite loadings made a particularly good showing. Of nine major anthracite carriers, the Erie was one of t,wo in August which showed a larger tonnage at anthracite handled than in August, 1931. The only other was the Lehigh & New England, whose share of the business is much smaller than that of the Erie. ,
In July, Erie’s anthracite loadings were down from the total for the 1931 month, but the percentage decline was substantially less than that recorded by the other big anthracite traffic carriers.	'
The Erie is in poor financial shape, and, of course Its future depends on a general business recovery. The past two months’ anthracite figures Indicate, however, that the road has had an improvement .larger than that enjoyed by competitors.	'
High-Grade Bonds Show Stability
Students of the bond market have been distinctly encouraged by the fact that the current reaction in security prices has not brought about the heavy selling, at drastic price concessions, in the high grade bonds that was witnessed late last spring. They feel that this Clearly Indicates a return of Investor confidence. ' The heavy sufferers in the current reaction In
up around 1 cent off nearly $1 a to close about
during the day,
the bond market have been the speculative railroad issues. The average of 10 second grade railroad bonds has dipped off fairly ^sharply, while .the.-average of the high-grade railroad bonds now is not far below the high of the rally. Tuesday, and again on Wednesday, when there was -weakness elsewhere in the list,* public utility bonds pushed ahead, bringing 'about fractional gains In the Dow-Jones average of 20 public utility" issues.
The sensational advances in speculative bonds^partlcularly the low-priced rail issues, attracted a purely speculative following into these issues. The second-grade ' issues have moved with stocks, but^the high grade bonds have not lost ground comparably. *
The appetite for the highest grade securities is demonstrated by the-'avid demand for government obligations. Subscriptions for the September 15 offering totaled close to $7,500,000,000, compared with the total offering of $1,250,000,000. The figures give some Idea of the vast amount of funds seeking' investment in the soundest securities. When* any definite recovery gets under way, these funds will be seeking Investment in general business.
German Trade Balance Higher
The increase in the German trade balance, to Rm. 96,000,000 in August, a gain of Rm. 30,000,000 over July, was welcome news. The Improvement was achieved by a drastic reduction In Imports. Exports in August were slightly under the total for July, while imports were down Rm. 34,000,000 from the previous month.
The drastic drop in imports, as compared with July, was peculiarly striking in view of the fact that raw material prices in August generally were higher than in July. A rise In raw material prices is temporarily adverse for Germany, for it is not immediately accompanied by an advance in finished goods prices, of which she is a large exporter. As an importer of raw materials, and seller of finished goods, Germany’s foreign trade suffers -from a temporary dislocation In the relationship between price levels for the two classes of goods.
