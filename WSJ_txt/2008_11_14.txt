Stocks finished lower Friday after seesawing throughout the day, capping a second straight week of declines amid new evidence that consumer spending is pulling back in a slowing global economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 337.94 points, or 3.8%, at 8497.31, wiping out more than half of Thursday's gains. The blue-chip average was off 5% for the week and down nearly 9% for the first two weeks of November.
"There's still a tremendous amount of nervousness out there," said trader Anthony Conroy, of BNY ConvergEx, a New York brokerage. "No one is looking for a broad rally while the economy is looking the way it is."
The stock market opened lower Friday morning after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 2.8% in October, the fourth straight decline and the biggest drop since records began in 1992. An attempt to rally fizzled as several retailers lowered their forecasts for the remainder of the year.
There was a brief move into positive territory after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on CNBC that he has grown more confident about the U.S. financial system. But the slide quickly resumed and picked up speed as the end of trading approached.
The Nasdaq Composite index fell 5% Friday, and 7.9% for the week, amid concerns about tech spending.
Intel was the biggest decliner among the 30 Dow components, down 7.7%, followed by Home Depot, off 7.6%.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.2% Friday to 873.29, down 6.2% on the week. All its sectors declined Friday. Nordstrom shares fell 9.4% after it issued guidance below analyst expectations.
As investors fled stocks Friday, they gobbled up long-term Treasurys. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 4.230% as the price jumped. Gold futures rose 5.3% to $742.40 an ounce.
