Lockheed-Consolidated Vultee—
The aviation industry is keeping its eye on the pending Lockheed-Consolidated Vultee merger. Wall Street has not been surprised, however, that nothing new has developed during the past week The unsettled stock market has had its effect, and it is understood that those working on the merger details are marking time until things steady down a bit. However, given reasonably stable conditions, a break in the situation is expected in less than a month.
There is a sound basis for the opinion that Aviation Corp., which has a substantial interest in Consolidated Vultee. wants to get out of the air frame business entirely. If the Lockheed merger goes through, it is not unlikely that Aviation Corp, will wind up with the holdings which Consolidated Vultee has in ACF-Erill Motors. The Aviation Corp might exchange some of whatever Lockheed stock it gets for the ACF-Brill shares (Consolidated has close to a one-half interest! held by Consolidated. Details have not yet been worked out. but this is regarded as the best guess.
Sin h a move would relieve Aviation Corp, of its share in the management of Consolidated. and would leave only the Lycoming Division i makers of air cooled motors for small planes i in active aircraft manufacturing. Irving Bab. ock. president of Aviation Corp, and chairman of Consolidated, would be relieved, presumably, of the latter post Aviation Corp, could then devote itself to the manufacture of household appliances, which it is now interested.
Incidentally,
hampered unduly by price controls. Expectations are that sales this year will comfortably exceed the $25.1 million reported last year. At their meeting late in August, directors failed to increase the quarterly dividend rate, an action which had been anticipated by many in the Street. The unsettled stock market conditions and the uncertain outlook for industry generally were believed to have been responsible for the boards conservatism. Those interested in the company now believe that more generous action may be taken at the November meeting. The directors in 1945 declared the regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents a common share and an extra dividend of 20 cents a share at the year-end.

Air Reduction Co.—	,
The reason for the omission of the "usual extra" dividend of 25 cents a share hv Air Reduction Co. is that earnings so far this year have not covered such payments. The steel strike and other labor t—mbles cut earn- 1 ings in the six months ended June 30, 1916. to 63 cents a share from 51.02 a year ago. Although earnings for the September quarter probably will be better than the 35 cents a share reported for the June quarter, the net | still is running below the 5(i cent dividend usually paid in the form of 25 cents regular and 25 cents extra.
The dividend just declared is the last one , of the year and brings total payments to $1.75 i a share. Net for the nine months probably will not be much over $1 a share. While the final quarter is expected to be better it is hardly likely to lift the net for the year to $2 a share, or enough to cover usual dividends. In • circles close to the management it is not believed that the action in omitting the extra means any change in policy. If business is al normal levels in the first quarter of next , year, the usual extra may be resumed. Air • Reduction is planning sizable cash outlays for plant expansion over the next few years, which is another reason for conserving cash, when dividends are not earned.	>

Mengcl Co.—	.	I
Less than a year ago. the Mangel Co., : manufacturer of furniture, hardwood plywood products and corrugated fibre containers, completed the first oil well on its Louisiana I property. At that time, Alvin A. Voit, president, reported that oil "in satisfactory quantity has been found." The company's properties. on the northwest fringe of a large oil field, have become of increasing importance j tn the company. Early in the summer, Mr ; Voit said, 12 wells were producing about $3,000 a month in revenue for the company. Up to the present time, Mengel's drilling has produced 17 flowing wells, three gas wells I which are shut off and four dry holes. The ! company's share of basic royalties ,.n allowable production of the 17 wells currently is adding about $5,000 monthly to Mengel's revenues.	j
