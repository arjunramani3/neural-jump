Abreast of the Market
Industrials Rebound 22.76 to Close at 670.76 In Moderate Trading; Outlook Is Seen Cloudy
By James Cakbsuy
Hie stock market rebounded smartly yesterday, but some analysts hedged their bets on whether the rally would last for more than a few sessions. Trading was moderate.
The Dow Jones industrial average spurted more than 11 points in the first half hour of trading yesterday, and observers attributed the gain to a report after Wednesday's close that the Federal Reserve Board acted to ease the availability of bank credit by reducing the reserve requirement on certain large-denomination certificates of deposit. Some traders didn’t read much significance into the Fed's action, however. “It was purely an operational move; it didn't signal any basic change” in the Fed's restrictive monetary policy, said Buck Kisor, senior vice president, Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis Inc.
During the middle of yesterday's trading session, the industrial average fell back somewhat; but in the final two hours it climbed sharply and closed at 670.76, up 22.76 points. That was the industrial average's biggest advance since Aug. 7, when it rose 23.78 points.
The transportation index finished with a strong gain and the utility indicator closed up a bit.
The market has a 50-50 chance of moving upward from its current level, said Charles Jensen, analyst with Merkln & Co. ‘‘A lot of damage has been done to the glamour issues and the industrial average stocks while the market has been in this area," he commented. “If they suffer more damage and volume remains fairly moderate, the market could continue downward and reach the 500 level in October. Or it could muddle about this level for a few weeks, trying to get a sustainable rally going."
Loan Demand Increased
After the close, the New York Federal Reserve Bank reported that business loans at the city’s major banks rose $347 million in the week ended Wednesday, compared with a rise of $105 million the previous week. The interest-sensitive stock market has been closely following the loan figures, and other indicators of the demand for money, for signs that interest rates might have peaked.
New York Stock Exchange volume yesterday fell to 14,210,000 shares from Wednesday’s 16,930,000. Stocks that gained led losers by about two to one through most of the session; at the close, gainers outscored losers, 996 to 441. However, there weren’t any issues that touched new 1974 highs; the previous day, only one did. Stocks touching new 1974 lows fell to 312 from 597 on Wednesday.
Rising 0.93 point, the American Stock Exchange index finished at 68.31. Advances led declines slightly. Turnover dropped to 1,740,000 shares from Wednesday's 2,100,000.
A gain also was posted by the National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ index of over-the-counter issues. It closed at 60.22, up 1.27.
In Washington, the Ford administration indicated again that it doesn’t plan any '■fundamental" legislative proposals for dealing with inflation following the "economic summit” meeting this month. And a trader at one Wall Street brokerage house suggested that President Ford “is just playing, for time. The government can’t come up with an instant cure for inflation. But by next year, the economy might return to normalcy of its own volition. Meanwhile, this conference can help educate the public on how complex the causes of inflation are, and how difficult it is to deal with the problem.”
In yesterday’s Big Board trading, 28 of the 30 issues in the Dow Jones industrial average advanced, and two declined. Du Pont rose 4% to 116%; Procter & Gamble 4 to 82; Eastman Kodak 3% to 78%, and Sears Roebuck 2% to 57%. U.S. Steel
