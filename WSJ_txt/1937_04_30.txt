Market Awaits Buying Attitude Change This Week
Passage of May 1 Seen Clearing Psychological Hurdle But Banks May Remain Aloof
New Issues Are Scheduled
The psychological date of May 1 having come and gone tit was the long-awaited deadline for the final 16 2-35^ boost in bank reserve requirements), investment bankers and borrowing corporations wall carefully watch the bond market this week to discern any very clear cut change in investment attitude . If buyers begin coming in for long deferred commitments it may indicate that prices will be pretty well stabilized around these levels.
Commercial banks, which have been largely out of the new issue market since the start of this year, will not, in the opinion of many bond men, begin re-entering the market in any very Impressive scale now. But during the course of the next week or two, if the market retains a steady tone, insurance companies, estates and perhaps to some extent individual Investors may be expected to become more active on the buying side than have been in the past few weeks and months.
Average Compared With High
As measured by the Dow-Jones average of 40 corporate bonds, prices are off nearly five points from the high of thi^ year in mid-Jan-uary although in many individual issues the losses are much more severe.
Reappraising the market after the somewhat panicky conditions which prevailed when Treasuries were declining so sharply last month p.nd all types of bonds were moving down with them, some observers again are*wilhng to predict that relatively easy money rates will prevail for a good while to com". They stress the Government’s continued power over banks, money rates and Treasury bonds; point to the fact that excess reserves of the banks today approximate $850,000,000, and emphasize the vast amount of Government refunding which remains to be accomplished.
Treasury’s Next Financing
Meanwhile, with the Federal Reserve System continuing to conduct open market operations in Treasury bonds, investment dealers already are giving some thought to what the Treasury will do in regard to its next financing.
In some quarters it is believed that no financing aside from the regular weekly bill borrowing and the $50,000,000 weekly extra will be atempted before the June quarter date even though the working balance of the Treasury will be down to a low point by that time.
Southern Bell
This week’s most impressive corporate bond offering will consist of $45,000,000 Southern Bell Telephone 3:^9r debentures which insurance companies, estates and other investors are likely to take in large quantities. Of this total. $42,500,000 will be publicly offered and the balance will be placed with pension funds of affiliated companies.
The action of the bond market toward the end of last week was encouraging to dealers who previously had been complaining that conditions were duller than at any time in their recolleciton of recent history In the trading on the Big Board, activity centered largely on speculative railroad bonds but a better feeling ort the part of institutional investors toward highest grade corporates also v.as noted by some houses.
Light Offerings
Offerings last week were unusually light, but the few issues which did make their appearance were disposed of quite successfully. The month of April, incidentally, was the lightest one of new bond offerings since the early part of 2935. There should be a pickup in volume this month but how extensive it will be remains for investors "to answer by their buying attitude in the next few days.
The contrast in this respect with a year ago is especially vivid because at this time in 1936 some of the largest issues in recent bond market history were coming to market in dazzling aray.
Defaulted Rail Average
The average of 20 defaulted railroad bonds showed a net loss on the week. On Monday the decline was 0.93; Tuesday 0 23; Wednesday. 1 13; Thursday, up 0.30; Friday, up 1.26; and Saturday, up 0.19. The net loss for the week was 0.44.
Bond Averages Lower
The bond averages again moved lower last week, the combined average of 40 bonds losing 0.22 on the week to close at 101.23. All groups did not share in the decline, however. High grade rails scored a gain of 0.10 at 107 29 and the industrial group finished at 105.81, up 0 13. The sharpest loss occurred in public utilities which at 102 99 were off 0.81. Second grade rails moved 0.32 lower at 88.41	*
