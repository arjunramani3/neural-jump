Individuals continued to bail out of their stock investments, forcing mutual funds to raise cash by trimming some of their large holdings, including big Nasdaq companies such as Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer. Those declines helped knock the Nasdaq Composite Index down 4.18%, or 53.60 points, to 1229.05 -- well below the level of 1300.12 at which it closed on Dec. 5, 1996, the day Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that investors could be succumbing to "irrational exuberance."
As the executive talked, the blue-chip average fell another 1.06%, or 82.24 points, to 7702.34, leaving it once again at its lowest point since October 1998. Citigroup fell nearly 16% and J.P. Morgan fell more than 18%, putting Citigroup at its lowest close since 1999, and J.P. Morgan at its lowest since 1996.
Although no single day has seen the kind of washout plunge that some traders feared, the cumulative selling of the past two months has created some of the sharpest and most relentless declines of a bear market that has endured for more than two years. Since May 17 alone, the Wilshire 5000 index, which includes almost every publicly traded company based in the U.S., has fallen 27%, and the Nasdaq composite is down 29%.

A MORNING STOCK RALLY fizzled again, as a wave of late-day selling pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average into its 11th decline of the past 12 trading sessions, and left the Nasdaq Composite Index down more than 4% on the day, its biggest one-day loss of the year.
Individuals continued to bail out of their stock investments, forcing mutual funds to raise cash by trimming some of their large holdings, including big Nasdaq companies such as Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer. Those declines helped knock the Nasdaq Composite Index down 4.18%, or 53.60 points, to 1229.05 -- well below the level of 1300.12 at which it closed on Dec. 5, 1996, the day Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that investors could be succumbing to "irrational exuberance."
"The declines have been relentless and that is unsettling," said Andy Brooks, head of stock trading at Baltimore mutual-fund group T. Rowe Price. "It is like having a wounded animal in the herd and the others picking on it. They just won't let up." He said the stock drops themselves are scaring investors, who need time to "catch their breath and assess things" but have trouble doing so in the face of the steady retreat.
The selling pressure was heavy. More than 2.43 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the second-heaviest trading day in Big Board history.
The Dow industrials might have staged a gain except for continued worries about the work two of its component companies, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, did that helped Enron disguise debts as trades. Officials from both financial groups testified before a Congressional committee yesterday.
As the executive talked, the blue-chip average fell another 1.06%, or 82.24 points, to 7702.34, leaving it once again at its lowest point since October 1998. Citigroup fell nearly 16% and J.P. Morgan fell more than 18%, putting Citigroup at its lowest close since 1999, and J.P. Morgan at its lowest since 1996.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gave up 2.70%, or 22.15 points, to close at 797.70, its first close below 800 in more than five years.
Although no single day has seen the kind of washout plunge that some traders feared, the cumulative selling of the past two months has created some of the sharpest and most relentless declines of a bear market that has endured for more than two years. Since May 17 alone, the Wilshire 5000 index, which includes almost every publicly traded company based in the U.S., has fallen 27%, and the Nasdaq composite is down 29%.
Bonds rose again as more money fled stocks. But the dollar, which has suffered as foreigners withdrew money from U.S. stocks, recovered sharply against the euro. It moved back above parity as some currency traders concluded that the dollar's steady decline had at least temporarily run its course.
A number of stocks managed to buck the declines, but they generally were "defensive plays" -- companies that make such products as cigarettes, razors, food or diapers, whose sales tend to hold up even in times of trouble. People have to eat and shave, even in a bear market. Gillette, Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and McDonald's all rose.
But some of the market's biggest stocks, including General Electric and Microsoft, fell sharply amid mutual-fund redemptions. "A lot of mutual funds are using their larger, more liquid names as a source of funds," explained Keith Gertsen, head of Nasdaq trading at brokerage firm Deutsche Bank Securities. "It wasn't driven as much by fundamental calls as a call for liquidity."
The market also, once again, was buffeted by a drumbeat of unconfirmed rumors -- that a huge block of Microsoft was for sale, that a bank was having trouble with a complex derivative position, or that the Federal Reserve was holding an emergency meeting to discuss Citigroup and J.P. Morgan. Traders said they didn't think any of the rumors were true, and sources familiar with the situation insisted that the rumor about the Fed and the banks wasn't true.
But the rumors kept investors nervous and contributed to their unwillingness to put much money at risk. The latest reports about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan have fueled worries that the fallout from the Enron collapse hasn't worked its way through the system yet.
