Yesterday's stock drop came after Republican leaders announced that 445 pages of independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report on President Clinton could be released as soon as today. Also contributing to the stock weakness was news of a 15% decline in Brazilian stocks yesterday on concerns about the country's internal economic problems; then again, the U.S. declines fed some of Brazil's skittishness, as well, as global markets chased their tails.
Shortly after the market closed, semiconductor giant Intel said that its third-quarter revenue was running ahead of expectations. Software giant Oracle at the same time was announcing quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations. The good technology news led many analysts to hope that stocks could at least start the day higher today. Several technology stocks moved higher in after-market trading.
Investors remained divided on how severe the current sell-off will become. Some traders insisted that small investors, who were selling stocks at some points in August, were showing little sign of net selling now. They said much of the current selling is being driven by sophisticated investors who have lost heavily in foreign markets and
have to raise cash. Some mutual funds actually said they were seeing a net intake of money.

The deepening Clinton scandal helped push blue-chip stocks close to the first bear-market point of this decade.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 249.48 points, or 3.17%, to 7615.54. While the close is still above the level the index sank to in August, it is now only 1.55 percentage points shy of a bear market, which is commonly defined as a drop of 20% or more from the high.
Yesterday's stock drop came after Republican leaders announced that 445 pages of independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report on President Clinton could be released as soon as today. Also contributing to the stock weakness was news of a 15% decline in Brazilian stocks yesterday on concerns about the country's internal economic problems; then again, the U.S. declines fed some of Brazil's skittishness, as well, as global markets chased their tails.
The anxiety was palpable, traders said. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 3/32, or $10.9375 for a bond with a $1,000 face value, to 104 15/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 5.196%, the lowest level for long-term bonds since 1968.
Computer-driven stock trading by sophisticated investors and big institutions was heavy. Overall, the 875.7 million shares that changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange were the sixth-highest volume in history.
But traders said the professionals, rather than individuals, did the bulk of the selling. Trading in futures contracts on the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was "insane," said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, as they bounced up and down and then hit lows late in the day when "someone dumped a lot of futures at the close. But he may regret that, given Intel's announcement."
Shortly after the market closed, semiconductor giant Intel said that its third-quarter revenue was running ahead of expectations. Software giant Oracle at the same time was announcing quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations. The good technology news led many analysts to hope that stocks could at least start the day higher today. Several technology stocks moved higher in after-market trading.
While yesterday's market decline was severe-and the industrials now are down 3.7% for the year -- the decline was only the fourth -- worst in the volatile period since July in both point and percentage terms. Other major indexes also fell, although utility stocks, classic havens because they offer large dividends, rose. In less than two months, the industrials are down 18.45% from the record July 17 close of 9337.97.
Analysts pointed out that stocks fell even harder and farther on Aug. 31, when the industrials plunged 512.61 points, only to rebound in the days since. None of the recent sell-offs has been nearly large enough to qualify as a crash.
Investors remained divided on how severe the current sell-off will become. Some traders insisted that small investors, who were selling stocks at some points in August, were showing little sign of net selling now. They said much of the current selling is being driven by sophisticated investors who have lost heavily in foreign markets and
have to raise cash. Some mutual funds actually said they were seeing a net intake of money.
Investors agreed that any stock-market recovery will be slow, given the combination of a slowdown in corporate earnings growth, the financial crisis abroad and the mess in Washington, and they said stocks could well sink farther before they turn up.
"We already have a bear market of sorts," said David Testa, chief investment officer at Baltimore mutual fund group T. Rowe Price. Other analysts pointed out that, although the big-stock averages still haven't hit bear-market territory, the average stock now is down more than 40% from its highs.
"This is more than just a modest correction in a bull-market cycle," Mr. Testa said. "We are in a period where we have broken the main drivers of that bull-market cycle. The whole pattern of stability with good earnings growth is broken, I would say."

Given the breadth of the sell-off, he said, he expects "a period of digestion or even relief" at some point, but he added that it could take time, especially if the Clinton situation isn't resolved quickly.
James Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for stocks at Boston mutual-fund group State Street Research, said he won't consider this a bear market until the big stocks go through a sustained downturn of 22% or 23% or more. "We still don't have the conditions that are classically associated with a bear market," he said, referring to the absence of a long, deep decline in big stocks.
But he agreed that any recovery would be slow. Mounting worries about Japanese banks, about U.S. lending to Latin America, about Asian recession and about Russia's future have served to shatter investor confidence, he said.
"All of this stuff, aside from the Clinton matter, is playing into concerns about earnings growth," Mr. Weiss noted. "And there is only one way to assuage worries about earnings growth, which is to have some earnings reports. And that is going to take weeks."
Although many investors until recently were hoping that Mr. Clinton would sidestep the Starr inquiry so that Washington leadership could continue unchanged, that view now appears to be shifting. With Mr. Clinton's authority now looking severely damaged, and with the unsettled world economy crying out for leadership, several professional investors said the stock market might applaud his departure.
"Given the fact that the market is down so sharply, we might even get a rally on the news in the belief that we have someone in power who can get things done," Mr. Weiss said.
As Treasury bonds soared, the dollar fell, another sign that U.S. and foreign investors may be selling U.S. stocks to cover losses in foreign markets.
On paper, investors lost almost $259 billion, based on the decline in market value of the Wilshire 5000 index. The Wilshire 5000, which includes virtually every publicly traded company with its headquarters in the U.S., saw its total market value fall to $9.9 trillion.
The average stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange declined $1.00, or 2.54%, to $38.36.
Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrials, all but one fell for the day. The one gainer was Exxon, which benefited from rising oil prices. Some of the biggest hits were taken by financial stocks, which suffered from fears that they will post more losses on emerging-market investments.
American Express, which has broad international operations, was the hardesthit of the Dow industrials, falling 7 3/16, or 9.37%, to 69 1/2. It, as well as Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Travelers Group all hit new 52-week lows during the day, although they regained some ground as stocks recovered at the close. On the Big Board, 523 stocks hit new 52-week lows, and just 22 hit 52-week highs.
The day's declines came in three big hits, punctuated by worries about the Starr report, by rumors, apparently unfounded, that Mr. Clinton would resign, and by news about Brazil's stock market. Anxious traders moved between their computer screens and television screens.
During the afternoon, CNBC cut to a speech the president was giving to a group of award-winning students, amid rumors of an announcement or another apology. Stocks dropped, only to recover when Mr. Clinton made only vague references to the scandals that surround him.
Meanwhile, noted Mr. Meehan, "the dollar was taking a pounding, which gave further encouragement to overseas investors to pack up their francs and D-marks and whatever else and bring them on home. Rumors flew about what was in the Starr papers."
At its lowest for the day, the industrial average was down 345.52 at about 3:40 p.m. EDT. But a late-day recovery brought it back 96.04 points in the final 20 minutes.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, heavy in small stocks and technology stocks, reentered bear territory with a drop of 39.22, or 2.41%, to 1585.33. It now is down 21.29% from its July 20 close of 2014.25.
The S&P 500 fell 26.01, or 2.58%, to 980.19, still short of a bear market.
"Last week everyone was still talking about Russia and Japan and Latin America, now they're talking about Clinton," said Dan Mathisson, head of stock trading at D.E. Shaw Securities. "People are using them as reasons for why it's going down, but once a sell-off like this starts, it takes on a momentum of its own and you don't need a reason." He noted that top Democrats came out with supportive comments for Clinton during the day, and "it didn't lead to a pop at all."
There were suggestions that small investors aren't panicking, and aren't driving the current declines. Mr. Testa of T. Rowe Price said that his group saw a "trickle" of redemptions by investors in August, but that "actually in September we have had net subscriptions in the aggregate."
Some of the heaviest stock-selling, according to several analysts and traders, has come from so-called hedge funds, sophisticated partnerships of rich individuals. They sometimes invest borrowed money on top of their own assets. As some of their bets on emerging-market currencies and stocks have soured, they have faced margin calls on their borrowings and have sold U.S. stocks to raise cash.
"The heavy intraday volatility appears to be due to significant liquidity problems among hedge funds and others that probably are using derivatives and have been forced to liquidate U.S. stocks because they may be having emerging-markets debt problems," said Thomas Galvin, portfolio strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Hedge-fund selling of dollars to cover foreign losses, including the unwinding of a complex foreign-currency strategy called the "yen carry," is thought to help explain the dollar's weakness as well.
Mr. Weiss said that the market's nearterm performance could depend on what happens in a series of investor conferences that have just begun, in which a variety of companies will discuss their outlooks. If more companies have the kind of good news Intel announced yesterday, he said, then the market could begin to turn around. If they don't, he said, stocks are in for more trouble.
"Between now and early October we will have all the information we need to get a pretty good idea of how bad the thing is," he said.
World-wide, stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 3.80 points to 167.88.
