Nearly half of all stocks in the index are now trading at less than $5, and 37% are under $3. "[...] credit gets flowing again, it's hard to see how we have any real recovery," said David P. Prokupek, chief executive of Denver investment-management firm Geronimo Partners.

Stocks resumed their relentless slide after a one-day respite, falling to new bear-market lows.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 281.40 points, or 4.1%, to 6594.44, its lowest close since April 15, 1997, and down more than 53% from its closing high on Oct. 9, 2007. It has fallen nearly 25% so far this year.
Financials again took center stage as Citigroup fell 9.7% to close at $1.02, after hitting an all-time low of 97 cents during the day. Just a year ago its shares changed hands at around $22 and two years ago it was a $50 stock and the biggest bank in the U.S. by market value.
General Motors fell below $2 for the first time, closing at $1.86, after its auditor cast doubt on the company's ability to continue operating.
Although the troubles facing GM and Citi were well known, the symbolic significance of their latest declines helped fuel the broad selloff, said Matthew Kaufler, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. "Seeing both icons of American business being brought to their knees is just feeding the fear," he said.
Stocks have lost $11 trillion in market value since the October 2007 peak, based on the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index, which includes nearly every U.S.-listed stock. Losses since the start of 2009 are $2.6 trillion.
Nearly half of all stocks in the index are now trading at less than $5, and 37% are under $3.
"Until . . . credit gets flowing again, it's hard to see how we have any real recovery," said David P. Prokupek, chief executive of Denver investment-management firm Geronimo Partners. He said his firm has lowered the weighting of stocks in its client portfolios to about 5% of assets, down from a high of about 15% last year.
The S&P 500-stock index fell 4.3% to 682.55, its lowest close since September 1996. Insurers posted big declines as Hartford Financial Group fell 20%.
Treasury prices rose and yields fell as investors sought havens. Gold, which had fallen recently from near-record highs, rose 2.3% to $927 a troy ounce.
The stock declines began in the morning after an expected Chinese economic-stimulus package, which drove global markets higher Wednesday, failed to materialize. The slide picked up speed in the late afternoon as mutual-fund managers sold shares to meet redemptions. Investors also worried about the government's February employment report, due Friday morning, which is expected to show further job losses.
Moody's Investors Service said it may downgrade the credit rating of Wells Fargo and lowered its outlook on J.P. Morgan Chase to negative. Wells Fargo shares fell 16%, while J.P. Morgan dropped 14%
Recent moves in Citi's stock have been magnified by traders trying to profit through an arbitrage that involved selling the bank's common stock while buying its preferred shares.
European markets also fell as investors brushed aside the latest government efforts to stabilize global markets. The Bank of England and European Central Bank both cut interest rates.
Stock investors are playing catch-up to bonds, which had reflected dire conditions months ago, said Basil Williams, CEO of hedge-fund manager Concordia Advisors. Although bonds other than super-safe U.S. Treasurys struggled Thursday as stocks fell, in recent weeks there has been demand for investment-grade corporate and municipal debt.
