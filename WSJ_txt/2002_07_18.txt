There were some affirmative responses to second-quarter profit statements. International Business Machines, for example, rose 1.36, or 1.9%, to 72.05, after reporting quarterly results. Telecommunications-service firm Sprint, which had fallen 4% Wednesday ahead of its earnings, advanced 56 cents, or 4.8%, to 12.26, even though the company's PCS Group wireless operation showed that subscriber growth, a key measure, slowed drastically. PCS Group tracking stock added 50 cents, or 10%, to 5.50.
Investors also had to deal with disturbing developments in the way some companies managed their balance sheets. Reinsurance provider XL Capital said it was going to add $200 million to its reserves for Sept. 11 claims. The stock fell 9, or 12%, to 65.50. Other insurers fell in sympathy. Everest Re, for example, lost 3.73, or 7.7%, to 44.60, hitting a 52-week low. American International fell 3.67, or 6%, to 57.23, falling to a 52-week low.
AOL Time Warner fell 66 cents, or 5%, to 12.45. An article in yesterday's Washington Post reported that the company's America Online unit boosted online advertising revenue through "unconventional deals" before and after it merged with Time Warner. The company said that its accounting for all transactions mentioned in the Post article was appropriate. In addition, the media company announced that Robert W. Pittman, its chief operating officer, will leave when a new chief executive is appointed; the announcement confirmed the expectation laid out in a report in yesterday's edition of The Wall Street Journal.

NEW YORK -- Disappointing forecasts and adverse economic data extinguished any hope that a rally had gotten under way on Wall Street.
Siebel Systems sank $2.12, or 18%, to $9.62 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading after the enterprise software maker reported second-quarter results that fell well short of Wall Street's projections, and the company reduced its outlook for the second half of the year. Trading activity climbed to more than 65 million shares from a daily average of 16 million amid bitter disappointment with the way the company had prepared Wall Street for the shortfalls.
Philip Morris lost 1.67, or 3.8%, to 42.45, while Kraft Foods lost 2.81, or 7.4%, to 35.13, after Philip Morris, which reported second-quarter results, tempered expectations for its growth in the second half. Kraft, 84%-owned by Philip Morris, did increase earnings by more than analysts had expected, but it touched off worries about its ability to sustain its volume growth.
There were some affirmative responses to second-quarter profit statements. International Business Machines, for example, rose 1.36, or 1.9%, to 72.05, after reporting quarterly results. Telecommunications-service firm Sprint, which had fallen 4% Wednesday ahead of its earnings, advanced 56 cents, or 4.8%, to 12.26, even though the company's PCS Group wireless operation showed that subscriber growth, a key measure, slowed drastically. PCS Group tracking stock added 50 cents, or 10%, to 5.50.
But the release of economic data showing that manufacturing activity in a key region slowed drastically this month, as well as more anxieties about accounting practices, extinguished any hope Wall Street might have indulged about building on Wednesday's rally. "This market doesn't know what it wants," said Steven Kroll, managing director of Monness Crespi & Hardt, "except out."
The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 132.99 points, or 1.56%, to 8409.49, more than wiping out Wednesday's 69-point gain. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 40.30, or 2.88%, to 1356.95.
Trading in UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest health insurer, sketched the trajectory of yesterday's trading. The stock traded sharply higher early, after the company reported a double-digit increase in profits, easily beating Wall Street's forecasts. But the gains gave way to the kind of dispiriting selloff that has characterized the market. The stock closed down 2.80, or 3%, to 89.70.
Which isn't to say the pessimism sprung from investors imagination. Automatic Data Processing, the Roseland, N.J., provider of payroll-processing services, which has recorded double-digit earnings growth every year since its public debut in 1961, announced that its enviable record is likely to end. The company said weak sales in its employer services, as well as declining U.S. interest rates, is going to limit earnings growth to less than 10% in its 2003 fiscal year. The stock fell 9.75, or 24%, to 31.60.
The outlook also singed some other payroll-services providers, such as PayChex, Rochester, N.Y., which fell 3.72, or 13%, to 24.50 on Nasdaq. Baxter International skidded 11.41, or 26%, to 32, after some analysts didn't like what they saw in the Deerfield, Ill., medical-device company's second-quarter results.
Sabre Holdings fell 4.05, or 14%, to 24.45, after the Fort Worth, Texas, provider of travel-reservation services, releasing second-quarter results, dimmed forecasts for its third-and fourth-quarter earnings, blaming a continued slump in the travel industry.
American Electric Power slid 3.14, or 9.1%, to 31.31, falling to a 52-week low, after the Columbus, Ohio, energy company said that second-quarter results would miss Wall Street's projections of 77 cents a share by as much as 25 cents, and reduced its guidance for 2002.
Investors also had to deal with disturbing developments in the way some companies managed their balance sheets. Reinsurance provider XL Capital said it was going to
add $200 million to its reserves for Sept. 11 claims. The stock fell 9, or 12%, to 65.50. Other insurers fell in sympathy. Everest Re, for example, lost 3.73, or 7.7%, to 44.60,
hitting a 52-week low. American International fell 3.67, or 6%, to 57.23, falling to a 52-week low.

AOL Time Warner fell 66 cents, or 5%, to 12.45. An article in yesterday's Washington Post reported that the company's America Online unit boosted online advertising

PNC Financial Services slid 6.91, or 15%, to 39.69, after a Securities and Exchange Commission ruling said the banking concern used improper accounting practices when transferring loans.
Ford Motor added 29 cents, or 2.3%, to 12.81. Deutsche Bank Securities, which had rated the stock an underperform, increased the rating on the auto maker, citing valuation; the stock dropped to a 52-week low earlier this week.
