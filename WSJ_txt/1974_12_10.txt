Abreast of the Market
By Gene G Maecial
The stock market yesterday posted a sharp gain in what some analysts said may presage a year-end rally powered by technical factors and the hope the government will become more aggressive in dealing with the recession.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 13.93 points to close at 593.87. The transportation and utility indicators also chalked up sizable gains.
"We probably have this year's bear market Str, behind us.” commented Heinz H Biel, analyst at Hoppin. Watson Inc. “This rally may continue at least through the end of the year and we may have seen the lows for 1974.” he added.
Following Monday's modest gain, the industrial indicator advanced 17.76 points by 2:30 p m., but part of that gain was erased in the final 90 minutes of trading.
“Many investors weren't surprised at yesterday’s rally since the market has been extremely oversold and the steep decline of the industrial average last week wasn’t confirmed by other market indicators," said Don Hahn, analyst with A. G. Becker in Chicago. “The market recognized that Washington has switched its attention to the problem of the recession and this should result in policies to stimulate the economy.”
Analysts said the buoyant mood among investors yesterday resulted partly from the sharp decline in short-term interest rates in several key sectors of the money market. The decline reflected the Federal Reserve Board's action Friday in cutting its discount rate, the fee it charges member banks.
Many Investors also were encouraged by signs that some commodity prices were declining, among them agricultural products such as sugar, said Michael Murray, vice president of Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee.
Big Board Volume Climbed
New York Stock Exchange volume climbed to 15,690,000 shares from Monday's 14,660,000. Advances outnumbered declines 965 to 423. Only two new 1974 highs were reached yesterday on the Big 'Board; none were reached Monday. There were 131 new 1974 lows touched yesterday, compared with 285 Monday. Institutional activity, as measured by trades of 10,000 shares or more, quickened to 94 from Monday's revised total of 75.
The American Stock Exchange index chalked up a modest gain. It finished at 58.90, up 0.64 Turnover increased to 2,-c80,000 shares from Monday's 2,280,000. The National Association ot Securities Dealers' NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter trading rose 0.85 point to 58.76.
Some analysts commented that the White House apparently is giving new attention to the energy problem. Interior Secretary Rogers Morton yesterday said the Ford administration may approve an increase in the gasoline tax in an effort to reduce fuel consumption. And an official of Ford Motor Co. told a Senate committee the government should take fuel-economy actions, Including tax incentives or disincentives, to encourage greater fuel conservation.
The market may also be reflecting optimism over yesterday's Senate confirmation of Nelson A. 'Rockefeller’s nomination as Vice President, said Ralph J. Acampo ra, analyst with Harris, Upham & Co. Mr. Rockefeller’s ascendancy to the No. 2 post could well mean the administration vrill give greater attention to business and the economy, Mr. Acampora said.
Glamour stocks were among those that made substantial gains on the Big Board yesterday. Sperry Rand rose 1% to 27%, Pfizer 1% to 31%, and Johnson & Johnson 2% to 82%. However, Xerox fell 1% to 54%.
Computer and drug issues were among Big Board winners yesterday, as were airline, chemical, copper, department store, electronic, food, machinery, motion pic-
