Stock prices boomed upward yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow-Jones industrial average climbed 20.37 points, or 3.7*)'/. its biggest jump since the market rally on May 29 and the third largest point rise on record.
Although >eveial key etononiir indicators showed increases jeMetdax, brokers and an-alv^ts said stock prices advanced strongly chiefly because they had gone down no lung and so far that a lallv was due
Prices .started to advance as trading opened and continued upward all dav Several times the advance faltered .slightly and trading quiet* ed, but each time it started to give wav prices soon rallied and went higher.
After its advance of 20 37 points or 3 79';, the Dow-Jones industrial average closed yes* terday at 557 35 The Dow-Jones railroad average climbed 2 27 points, or 1 96rr. to 118 21 for its largest n^e since June 15 The utility average went up 3 15 points, or 3 03',r. to end at 107 08 This was its biggest gain since May 31
Volume increased to 5.440.000 shares yesterday from 3.890,000 Wednesday. The stock exchange quotation ticker fell late in reporting floor transactions four times and during the first hour lagged by as much as 12 minutes. Prices advanced each time the tape ran late
At the end of the day-long surge, about 85% of the stocks traded showed gains from Wednesday. Of the 1 286 stocks that traded. 1,024 advanced. 131 declined and 131 ended unchanged for the day One stock Pet Milk preferred-hit a new high for the year, while 44 issues fell to new’ lows: the new lows have been running well over 100 recently.
The stocks that continued to dominate trading were issues that one research chief described as “Stocks that have had good earnings records, that sold at very high priceearnings ratios and that were thoroughly beaten down in the market in May and June.” In addition, many of these stocks had been targets of heavy short selling, as shown by June 15 statistics released by the New York Stock Exchange.
Many of the most active stocks fitted into this broad category, and all posted sharp gains Polaroid, the most active stock for the third straight day, rose 2% points to 98 on turnover of 101,400 shares. Xerox, second most active, jumped 6% to 115% as 84.100 shares were traded. Litton Industries, third most active, ran up 6 to 93% on volume of 80.000 shares. Zenith Radio advanced 2% to 49% on transfer of 66,600 shares. Magnavox climbed 2*4 to 31% as 60.100 shares traded. International Business Machines went up 11 to 344 on Volume of 54.500 shares.
Brokers were generally enthusiastic about the market’s strong advance, and many predicted it would continue. “Did you notice the way it (volume) caught on each time prices started to slip back?” one partner asked. “That means we're going to get the rally we’ve been looking for.” he exclaimed. “With the industrial average down about 200 points since mid-March. nobody can say at least some sort of rally isn’t overdue.” he added.
Another partner in charge of research listed several reasons why he thought stocks would continue to advance for a while. First, he said, military spending is likely to speed up after the beginning of the Federal fiscal year July 1. July and August traditionally have been months for gains in stock prices as there’s generally a relative dearth of business news that could push prices down. And speculative interest in stocks of growing companies such as IBM, Beckman Instruments, Fairchild Camera A Instrument and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing has been increasing lately and shows signa of fanning out to other segments of the stock market, he said.
The latest figures on the economy, he added, show nothing too damaging. The market has already gone a long way toward taking into account a slowdown in the economy next year, he asserted. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that new orders received by manufacturers rose slightly in May after a two-month decline. Also, construction outlays in June rose to the highest level of any month on record, the Census Bureau reported.
Some analysts suggested that mutual funds bought stock yesterday in an effort to help push prices upward in order to improve their June 30 quarterly statements. But the head of one group of investment companies, who said his firms were not making such purchases, strongly doubted funds were buying extra heavily. “I just don't think investment companies are that powerful," he said.*
American Photocopy. 10th most active and the only one of the 10 to decline, fell % to 16% on volume of 53,600 shares following news that its earnings for the quarter ended May 31 decreased to 17 cents a share from 20 cents a year earlier.

Market Views—
OPINION: According to Harris, Upham & Co., “The market may well have difficulty in surpassing the 610-620 area in the Dow-Jones industrial average,” the recovery peak reached immediately after the May 28th break. . . . Hardy & Co : "We believe the precipitate decline witnessed in common stock prices this year marks the end of an era in the stock market But we are of the conviction the present bear market will be remembered more for its severity than its duration, that it represents a correction of excessive stock prices and that It isn’t an augury of a coming business slump It is far too early to write 'finis' to the dream of the ‘soaring sixties’ ”
