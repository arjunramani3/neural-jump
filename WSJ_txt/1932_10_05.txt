preliminary estimates. This would be 8 cents a share more than the road reported for September, and the best month so far this year-A number of other carriers will have reports which will be in favorable contrast to those for earlier months this year. The improvement, of course, is largely seasonal. The monthly statements should pegin to make their appearance in about two weeks.

Traction .Share Flurry Evaporates
The flurry in traction stocks on Tuesday proved only a flash in the pan. Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit common, which ran up to 24 in Tuesday’s trading, sold off with the rest of the list, losing around three points. Interborough bonds, too, were lower after Tuesday’s firmness.
The traction company securities always are subject to sharp fluctuations as result of day-to-day developments. So far as fundamental traffic conditions are concerned, there has been no important change in the picture from that portrayed at the end of the companies’ fiscal years, when officials called attention to the steady declines in traffic.
Sharp declines took place in the securities markets yesterday, stocks breaking- tinder heavy selling; that forced pivotal issues down anywhdre from two to eight points and bonds sagging under the weight of a steady stream of offerings. Wheat dropped more than two cents a bushel, and other grains wore at new lows for the season. Cotton, in the face of the weakness elsewhere, held moderately steady, closing off 6 to 11 points.
The break carried stocks emphatically out of the trading range which had prevailed over the past 10 sessions. The Dow-Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 5.09 points, or 7.1% and the rail average sold off 3.95 points, or 11.8%. compared with Tuesday’s final figures.
The opening in stocks gave little foretaste of the drastic declines which were to come later in the session. Stocks were no worse than irregular at the start, with pivotal issues recording only fractional overnight changes. The list was steady for a brief time, but then started sagging, with trading picking up sharply in volume. Stocks retreated over a broad front. American Telephone getting down to about 10S, off more than four points from the opening price and other pivotal issues losing ground in the morning session.
The list steadied for a time, but in the final hour broke abruptly, as pressure was increased. Recent trading favorites, and stocks which had come in for a good deal of group activity, were the big sufferers.^ At the close. United Aircraft, at 25Vi. was off 5’4. and Douglas Aircraft at 11S. off 4’4. Montgomery Ward, at 13 S, was down 2’4, and J. I. Case, always a swift mover, sank to 46^, off
In pivotal stocks .declines were heavy. The rails were heavily sold, Atchison losing 7, York Central 4%. and Southern Pacific, a favorite speculative vehicle recently, 4%. No group of stocks was spared in the general decline. Volume of trading ran to 3,000,000 shares, against 1,200,000 shares Tuesday.	*
So far as news was concerned, the immediate business indices included electric power output figures which made a more favorable comparison with the like week of 1931 than had those for the previous week. For the week ended October 1, the New England Power Association's primary output actually was up slightly from the total for the like week of 1931. Dividend news was generally favorable. Wall Street also had before it the President’s address on farm problems, delivered in Des Moines.
In Paris the tone of the market was firmer. In London foreign bonds were generally strong, with the stock list irregular.

The R. F. C. Report
Demands on the Reconstruction Finance Corp, from banks and trust companies have been in a downtrend since April, the report <rf the organization’s operations from February 2 to August 31 revealed. From the peak month of April, when applications reached a total of 1,269, they declined in August to 899, or only about 70ro of the April figure.
The trend of demands from other financial organizations for aid from the government has not been so favorable. Applications from livestock and agricultural credit corporations have moved steadily upward. In April, only two agricultural credit corporations were seeking aid, while in August, 30 applications from such organizations were received. Requests from livestock credit units have moved steadily forward from nine in April to 32 in August.
The steady rise in applications for loans from these two groups of organizations has come despite the modest rise in commodity prices over the past few months. The tabulation of the number of borrowers and the number of loans shows that 10 agricultural credit corporations have received 68 loans, or an average of close to seven loans for each institution. Seventeen livestock credit corporations have received 98 loans, or about an average of six loans for each institution. This is far higher than for any other of the groups.
Repayments, according to the latest report, were slightly higher than up to August 1. So-called commercial borrowers, to August 31, have repaid about 13.4% of the funds advanced them. Repayments to August 1, according to Secretary Mills, were 11 2% of advances.
Hoover Deads on Pointir*^.
Figuring on a point basis. President Hoover has piled up a nice lead over Governor Roosevelt in the farm belt. The President's speech was a 12-point affair, while the Governor’s program for aiding the farmers, as outlined in lus Topeka address, contained only six points.
• Kail Stocks Sag Off Dually
Yesterday’s decline in stocks found the rail shares sagging off rather easily, with pivotal rail shares under distinct pressure. The declines, in a number of cases, carried individual stocks down 23% from their recent recovery highs.
Loadings reports of individual carriers, so far received, present a rather mixed picture of traffic conditions during the week ended October 1. Both the New York Central and the Pennsylvania had more traffic thnn in the week ended September 24, but the declines from the similar week of 1931 were larger than, for previous weeks. Some Southwestern roads, particularly the Kock Island and the Missouri Pacific, made much improved showings.
Reports of a number of carriers for September, for the first time in many months, should make rather pleasant rending. The Chesapeake & Ohio, for instance, may report net lrcomo for the month equal to close to 38 cents a share on the common stock, according to
