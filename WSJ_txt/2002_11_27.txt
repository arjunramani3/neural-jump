The Nasdaq Composite Index, which jumped 43.51, or 3%, to 1487.94, has risen 34% since Oct. 10, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, with its rise of 25.56, or 2.8%, to 938.87, has gained 21%. Reflecting technology's big role in the rally, the Nasdaq 100 Index of large nonfinancial stocks is up just shy of 40% since Oct. 10.
Trucking stocks rose on sentiment that the day's data reflected a recovery that is back on track. CNF added 4%, or 1.20, to 31.10 and C.H. Robinson Worldwide (Nasdaq) advanced 2.7%, or 79 cents, to 30.25. Swift Transportation (Nasdaq) attained large-cap status as its rise of 10%, or 1.74, to 18.59 put its market capitalization above the $1.5 billion floor this column uses to define big stocks.
Eli Lilly rose 7.8%, or 5, to 69 after receiving Food and Drug Administration approval for its attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drug Strattera. That wasn't good news for Shire Pharmaceuticals Group (Nasdaq), which dropped 12%, or 2.93, to 21.02 because Lilly's new drug will compete with Shire's Adderall and Adderall XR brands which have a combined 29% market share in the U.S. and account for about 40% of the company's revenue.

NEW YORK -- In an appropriate showing on the day that the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 8900 for the first time since late August, stocks with "swift" and "leap" in their names helped lead the rally.
The market's surge on Wednesday surprised many who expected a sleepy session ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but it quickly became apparent the day would be anything but as a series of upbeat economic and business reports kept coming in.
"The flow really bolstered bulls' case," said Howard Barlow, managing director with Cypress Strategies. "But I'm beginning to fear we're getting a bit overextended."
Still, the session demonstrated a practice investors are readopting after a long dry spell. "We're buying on the dips instead of selling on the rallies," Mr. Barlow said. "That's a big change in sentiment."
The day's advances technically placed major large-cap indexes in bull-market territory because all are now up more than 20% from their Oct. 9 lows.
The Dow has gained 23%, including its gain of 3%, or 255.26 points, to 8931.68 on Wednesday that was fueled by advances from all 30 of its members. The industrial average's biggest advancers were 3M, rising $4.23, or 3.4%, to $129.63, Caterpillar, gaining 2.17, or 4.6%, to 49.26 and International Business Machines, adding 2.64, or 3.1%, to 87.70.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, which jumped 43.51, or 3%, to 1487.94, has risen 34% since Oct. 10, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, with its rise of 25.56, or 2.8%, to 938.87, has gained 21%. Reflecting technology's big role in the rally, the Nasdaq 100 Index of large nonfinancial stocks is up just shy of 40% since Oct. 10.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.347 billion shares. Advancers outpaced decliners, 2578 to 678.
Trucking stocks rose on sentiment that the day's data reflected a recovery that is back on track. CNF added 4%, or 1.20, to 31.10 and C.H. Robinson Worldwide (Nasdaq) advanced 2.7%, or 79 cents, to 30.25. Swift Transportation (Nasdaq) attained large-cap status as its rise of 10%, or 1.74, to 18.59 put its market capitalization above the $1.5 billion floor this column uses to define big stocks.
In the holiday vein, Coca-Cola Enterprises added 5.7%, or 1.15, to 21.30 and Pepsi Bottling moved up 5.6%, or 1.52, to 28.77 as shares of soft-drink bottlers responded to analysts' sentiment that a projected spike in pricing for the Thanksgiving weekend could calm investor worries about margin pressures.
LeapFrog Enterprises did just that, rising 6.7%, or 2.05, to 32.70 despite a downbeat report by Bear Stearns, which downgraded the educational-products company to underperform from peer perform. LeapFrog has been on fire, rising roughly 150% since its initial public offering July 25.
Drug companies that were hard hit by Tuesday's selling showed renewed health.
The American depositary receipts of Teva Pharmaceutical gained 2.7%, or 2.04, to 78.99, an all-time high, after the company said it exercised an option to market a generic version of gastrointestinal ulcer treatment Prilosec, a knockoff that was developed by small-cap Impax Laboratories, which jumped 12%, or 49 cents, to 4.60.
Eli Lilly rose 7.8%, or 5, to 69 after receiving Food and Drug Administration approval for its attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drug Strattera. That wasn't good news for Shire Pharmaceuticals Group (Nasdaq), which dropped 12%, or 2.93, to 21.02 because Lilly's new drug will compete with Shire's Adderall and Adderall XR brands which have a combined 29% market share in the U.S. and account for about 40% of the company's revenue.
Systems consulting firm Electronic Data Systems advanced 4.7%, or 82 cents, to 18.17 after announcing plans to change its strategy to pursue business that generates near-term cash flow and profit. The rise came in tandem with news that Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's debt, citing weakness in its markets and exposure to troubled companies including WorldCom.
Comverse Technology (Nasdaq) gained 13%, or 1.44, to 12.17 after the maker of telecommunications systems and software posted a quarterly loss of 13 cents a share
before items, while analysts were expecting a loss of 15 cents a share.

Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq) also rose, by 5.6%, or 21 cents, to 3.97 after saying it expects fiscal second-quarter revenue to meet analysts' estimate of $2.92 billion.
Dollar General dropped 8.5%, or 1.20, to 12.86 after the discount retailer's third-quarter earnings fell two cents short of what Wall Street had anticipated and the company also indicated a "strong profit performance" will be needed in December to meet the low end of previous guidance for 10% to 15% profit growth for the full year.
H&R Block declined 17 cents to 38.33 after the tax preparer posted a fiscal second-quarter loss that met analysts' estimates.
El Paso gave up a bit more, easing eight cents to 8.55 after plummeting 20% Tuesday when the energy producer's debt rating was reduced to junk status by Moody's, which cited weak cash flows, high debt levels and a likelihood that capital expenditures will continue to exceed cash flow from operations. El Paso issued a rebuttal saying Moody's was "largely ignoring" progress the company has made.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index was 496.29, up 12.89. The average price per share rose 74 cents.
