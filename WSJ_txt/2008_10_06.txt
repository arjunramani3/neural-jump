Monday's 369.88-point, or 3.6%, drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, sending it below the 10000 mark at 9955.50, didn't seem like a round of capitulation, said Doreen Mogavero, president and chief executive of the New York floor brokerage Mogavero Lee & Co. "Yes, it's a big move, but there hasn't been the sort of [trading] volume behind it that we'd like to see," in order to confirm that there isn't another wave of sellers still waiting on the sidelines, Ms. Mogavero said.

Even as stocks tumbled to multiyear lows, investors and traders were worried about more declines because they saw few signs of capitulation -- or last-ditch selling that typically marks a market bottom.
Monday's 369.88-point, or 3.6%, drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, sending it below the 10000 mark at 9955.50, didn't seem like a round of capitulation, said Doreen Mogavero, president and chief executive of the New York floor brokerage Mogavero Lee & Co.
"Yes, it's a big move, but there hasn't been the sort of [trading] volume behind it that we'd like to see," in order to confirm that there isn't another wave of sellers still waiting on the sidelines, Ms. Mogavero said.
The Dow closed below 10000 for the first time since Oct. 26, 2004. The Dow Jones Stoxx index of 600 big European companies had its worst percentage drop in its 20-year history as emergency government measures failed to stem concerns about the region's financial system and economy.
The U.S. government's $700 billion plan to bail out financial institutions didn't stop the Dow industrials from falling about 800 points during the afternoon, to the lowest intraday level in bearly five years, although they recovered some of those losses in the last hour of trading. All 30 Dow components declined, led by Bank of America, which fell more than 6.5%.
The Dow has dropped 8.2% in the past four trading days, the largest four-day percentage decline in more than six years. The blue-chip average is now 29.7% below its record hit last October.
The DJ Stoxx index finished down 7.6%, Germany's DAX was 7.1% lower, the U.K.'s FTSE-100 fell 7.9% and the CAC-40 in Paris tumbled more than 9%.
The dollar rose 2.1% against the euro, which was at its lowest level since August 2007 in late New York trading.
Oil futures tumbled 6.1% in New York, to $87.81 a barrel, the lowest end-of-day price since Feb. 6 and 40% below its July 3 record as investors bet on a drop in demand for energy in a weak economy.
Trading in Russia was halted after the dollar-denominated RTS Index plunged 19.1%, its biggest-ever one-day loss, and emerging markets elsewhere also tumbled. The Russian central bank was forced to use $4 billion to $5 billion of its reserves to support the ruble amid the rout, traders said.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 42.34 points, or 3.9%, to 1056.89, the lowest close in nearly five years.The S&P is down 9.4% in the last four trading days, the largest four-day decline since July 2002.
With stocks falling, indicators of investor anxiety flashed higher. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index, a key measure of investor fear, leapt 15.3% to 52.05.
Treasury prices rose as investors fled for safety. Gold futures jumped 4.1% to $862.70 per troy ounce.
"We're seeing pure fear right now," said Don Bright, of the Chicago proprietary firm Bright Trading. "My guys who usually trade 5,000 shares at a time are now trading 1,000 or 2,000. They're a lot more skittish."
