Upbeat remarks from Wells Fargo sparked big gains for bank stocks Thursday and drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average back above 8000.
The Dow leapt 246.27 points, or 3.1%, to close the holiday-shortened week at 8083.38, the highest since Feb. 9. Financial stocks have driven the benchmark to a 22% rise in the past five weeks, the biggest such gain since 1938. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.8%, led by a 16% surge in its financial sector. All S&P categories gained Thursday.
Wells Fargo jumped $4.72, or 32%, to $19.61 after the bank said it expects to announce record net income of approximately $3 billion, or 55 cents a share, for the first quarter. The company said it is seeing strong operating results from its acquisition of Wachovia and that mortgage-refinancing activity has been brisk.
Wells Fargo's announcement spurred a 35% gain in Bank of America and a 19% rally in J.P. Morgan Chase. Citigroup had a relatively muted gain of 13%.
"There is going to be a clear difference between winners and losers," said Patrick Becker Jr., chief investment officer for Portland, Ore.-based Becker Capital Management. "The weak are being thinned out and the strong are stronger. If you have defendable market share and growing margins, that's a winner."
Growing optimism that banks may be beginning to heal has helped propel the S&P financials index up 70% since March 9, the day before Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit sparked a rally by telling employees that January and February had been profitable.
Wells Fargo's surprise announcement, a day before the Good Friday market holiday, also forced some large investors to reverse bearish bets they had placed on bank stocks ahead of earnings, said Dave Rovelli, managing director of U.S. equity trading at Canaccord Adams.
Some participants took Thursday's gains with a bigger grain of salt.
David Chalupnik, head of equities trading at FAF Advisors in Minneapolis, welcomed Thursday's rally in Wells Fargo -- a stock his firm has bought recently. But he added: "This is a very company-specific thing" and the announcement doesn't necessarily portend good news for other banks.
Credit markets indicate bond investors also are less euphoric. While an index reflecting the cost of protecting bank bonds against default has declined 23% since March 9, it is still at levels seen last October, when the market was in the grip of the credit crisis, according to Credit Derivatives Research LLC.
Financial bonds rallied Thursday, though their gains have been less stark than financial stocks'. According to Merrill Lynch indexes, prices of bank bonds rose to 82.75 cents from 79.05 cents March 9.
Wal-Mart Stores shares declined 3.7% after the discount giant posted disappointing same-store sales. Strategist Bill King, of M. Ramsey King Securities in Chicago, said Wal-Mart's results are a worrisome sign that consumers are moving even further down the cost scale to retailers like Family Dollar.
Other indicators gave stocks a boost as unemployment and inventory data indicated the economy may be stabilizing. Treasurys fell as investors became more confident about buying riskier assets and oil futures climbed past $52 a barrel.
