THE STOCK MARKET
A
BRISK RECOVERY
On opening decline a strong buying; demand appeared whicii carried prices up considerably from tbe low.	»
Sales 561,703 shares
Although it was everywhere conceded that the destruction of the Lusitania, with heavy loss of life of American eitizens, was one of the most serious occurrences involving this country’s -relations with Germany since the outbreak of ■the war, -the market gave a good account of itself in the course of the day, the sober second thougnt of the -financial crnrrmirnaty serving to repair the destruction ot values caused by the hysteria of inexperienced speculators following the receipt on Friday of the first news of the marine disaster. Commission houses which had sent out calls for additional margin received a good response in most cases, but there was still a sufficient amount of forced liquidation to cause declines at the opening, although these were not large enough to put prices of the leading stocks back to the lowest figures touched on Friday afternoon. There was on the other hand, a big <jnd well sustained demand, in response to which the market immediately developed an improving tendency, so that the lowest prices of the session were those made at or immediately following the opening. The absorption of United States Steel attracted particular notice and the standard issues were notably well bought. The indications furnished by Friday’s Government crop report of a record breaking winter wheat crop, and the favorable conditions for other -crops, probably had some effect on sentiment, although in conservative quarters it was argued that their significance had not received full recognition, because attention was too much taken up by the Lusitania affair. For a similar reason there was practically no discussion of the news that China had accepted .Japan's modified proposals, and that the danger of war in the Orient had parsed away. The large buyers of stock showed*an inclination to withhold additional orders after prices had rallied substantially 'from the low, and this caused hesitation and a little reaction in the second hour.
The weekly trade reviews indicated a steady pice of business without pronounced improvement in the course of the week. The cotton market was dull, but the gram markets were weak, as a result of liquidation caused by the remarkable showing in the Government report. Rank clearings for the week showed an increase of 25.40 over the corresponding week la^t year, hut thi< was largely due to activity on the exchanges. The weekly bank statement reflected the effect of corporation financing, with an increase of §14.837,000 in the loan account, while the surplus reserve was reduced by §7.785,000. These changes. however, are not important enough to produce any material effect on the money situation. After the close the opinion was expressed in some of the larger offices that the market ha« had a sufficient decline to discount the most serious possibilities in the international situation.
Above Lowest
There was a large volume of activity at the opening.
and while prices showed considerable declines from Friday’s close, they were not quite down to that day’s lowest figures? Although the hope aroused by the reports late on Friday afternoon that no lives had been lost proved to be unfounded, the Street took a calmer view of the Lusitania matter than when the first news was received, and buying of an investment and absorptive kind was in evidence, notwithstanding heavy liquidation by weak speculators who were unable to respond to calls for additional margin.
To make the opening on United States Steel, 15,000 shares were done simultaneously at prices from 52 to 52% compared with 54% at the close on Friday, and a low of; 51% for that day. Bethlehem Steel opened % off at 144%, this price being, however, 14% points up from the low point of the decline.
In Union Pacific the opening was made by 2,000 shares at 123, an over-night decline of 2% points, but a net gain of a point from Friday’s low. Lehigh Valley opened 1% off, and Southern Pacific at a decline of l’u. In Utah Copper the first sale was 3% points down at 61; while American 'Locomotive and Baldwin opened at the same price, 45, a decline of 2 points in the first case, and of 5 points in the latter. To make the opening on Westinghouse there was 6,000 shares from 82 to So. compared with 92 at Friday’s close, and 79 at that day’s lowest.
Biiytngr of Steel
The prices made at the opening were the lowest of the first half hour, and at the end of that period good sized rallies were shown all through the list. The trading was on an enormous scale, and while the market was feverish and highly excited, it was evident that buying by strong interests was in progress.	.	.	. u
Some observers said the most impressive thing in the market was the apparently unlimited demand for United States Steel, which from its opening price recovered -points in a comparatively short time. Naturally, there was a large amount of scattered liquidation in that’ popular issue, but the absorptive capacity was wonderful.
The buying demand would have been much greater than it actually was but for the conservatism exercised by the brokerage houses in the matter of bu>ing on margin. Orders were refused in cases where onl> such margins were offered as are insisted upon in normal time.-, this being the proper course, although in some cases brokers went to extreme* in demanding as much as
Reading sold down to 140, duplicating the closing price of .lulv 30, piioi to the closing of the Exchange as a Result of the outbreak of the war. A comparatively short time, howcvci, was sufficient to bring about a rally of ." points.	*	.
It was rumored on the floo: that it was a mine and not a torpedo which destroyed the Lusitania That wo’dd bo reason for extreme measuies by the United States, but the story wa> of doubtful origin.
A Keassurinjr Hffect
Towaids the end of the first hour there was some decrease of activity, hut the market ma ntained its advance exceedingly well and its action tended to produce a reassuring effect on sentiment. Large houses reported tha
their richest customers were heavy buyers of stock, and some of them asserted that it was this factor rather than organized support which gave the market its comparative strength. *
Kock Island showed remarkable firmness, and while traders asserted that this was due to the existence of a large short interest, the explanation did not seem to be sufficient. The splendid cutlook for^the crops in. the southwest wa-s undoubtedly a factor in that stock, as it was also in Atchison, which at its low point cf 9S% showed a decline of less than 2 points from Friday's highest. That the Government crop report, wholly disregarded when published on Friday, would produce a good effect later on was believed in conservative quarters.
Houses which had la?ge buying orders said they were unable to execute all of them at the price limits fixed, and in many cases the advice was given to customers to refrain from following prices up, but to stand ready to take advantage of further reactions. This tends to keep the market from getting into a weak technical position.	f
Buying Slackens
The buyirg slackened in the second hour, as those who were brought into the market by the offering of stocks on the bargain counter became less anxious to make purchases when prices were marked up considerably from the low figures. Trere was even some short selling by traders, who argued that a lot of stock had been bought for the purpose of rendering support, and that it would come upon the market again at the first opportunity.
Amalgamated Copper acted well as the weak bull account had been shaken out. After opening 2% off at 65% the price rallied until it recovered that loss and about % in addition. No effert was made to advance the stock on the dissolution plan, but the Street st 11 took a favorable view* of the trade outlook.
