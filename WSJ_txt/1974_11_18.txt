Recession Fears Drop Industrials 22.69 Points For Sharpest Retreat in More Than 10 Months
By Victob J Hiixeby
The stock market came face to face with the recession yesterday and ran for cover in a big way with trading fairly active. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 22.69 points for its biggest loss in more than 10 months.
Underscoring the economy’s course was Chrysler's announcement late Friday of an open-ended closedown of an assembly plant. However, after the close yesterday, the company said it wouldn’t have a complete production halt during December.
“The seriousness of the recession was brought home in a dramatic style by the news of the auto industry closedowns,’’ commented Robert Stovall, vice president of Reynolds Securities Inc.
Two other developments that added to the market's woes were the delay in consideration of a new coal-labor contract that will push the miners' strike into at least a third week, and renewed tension over the weekend along the Israeli-Syrian front.
After sliding 19.55 points all last week, the industrial average yesterday fell another 13.30 points in the first 30 minutes. Losing more ground during the rest of the session, it closed at 624.92. The transportation and utility indicators also skidded sharply. The industrial average's setback was the biggest since it plunged 26.99 points last Jan. 9.
Indicative of the wide sweep of the retreat were the 1,382 New York Stock Exchange losers, almost 10 times the 140 gainers. There were 80 issues that sank to 1974 lows, up from 27 Friday, and only three new highs, against seven the prior session.
Initial Hour Was Heaviest
Big Board trading, heaviest during the first hour, swelled to 15,230,000 shares from 12,480,000 Friday. Reflecting the pace of institutional activity, trades of 10,000 shares or more slowed to 85 from 106 Friday.
John J. Doherty, president of Doherty & Salter Inc., said the drop "wasn’t surprising when you consider all the bad news the market had to take In the past few days." Among those items were the announcements of the 27.6% seasonally adjusted wholesale-price jump last month; the industrial output decline of 0.6% in October, and the gross national product’s third quarter fall of 2.1% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
Interest rates continued to ease but this one bright spot failed to stem the negative tide. Two other major banks, Morgan Guaranty Trust and First National Bank of Chicago joined First National City in cutting their prime lending rate % point to 10%%. A few more banks also went to 10%%.
Donald T. Regan, chairman of Merrill Lynch & Co., said that although he sees unemployment as high as 7% and doubledigit inflation for at least another six months “a Thirties-style depression isn’t about to happen.”
The American Stock Exchange took a drubbing, too. Its index slid 1.73 to 67.03 and losers led winners by almost five-to-one. Turnover quickened to 2,150,000 shares from 1,790,000 Friday. A sharp loss also was posted by the National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter stocks; it finished at 62.09, off 2.32.
Bond prices joined the retreat. Prime corporates were down an average of about % point in light, over-the-counter trading and long-term governments fell as much as 10-32 point.
Almost all stock groups lost ground on the Big Board yesterday, including sharp losses by golds, which frequently move counter to the general market.
In the auto sector, Chrysler, sixth most active, fell % to 8%. General Motors, in fourth place, bumped a 1974 low of 31%
