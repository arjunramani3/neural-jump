Industrials Fall 93.31 as Investors Continue Reaction to Iraqi Invasion
By David Wilson Staff Reporter of Tur. Wall Stmkkt Jouhnal
NEW YORK-The stock market turned in Its worst performance since its “minicrash" in October as Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent surge in oil prices triggered another round of broadbased, heavy selling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted about 105 points within the first 45 minutes of the session and finished down
93.31	at 2716.34, its lowest level since early May.
"Everybody was kind of punched out after the first two hours of trading," since the market's plunge "pretty much happened right out of the gate," said Sid Dorr, head of institutional trading at Charles Schwab & Co., San Francisco.
Among broader market measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index skidded
10.43	to 334.43, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 5.50 to 183.32 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index tumbled 10.50 to 309.61.
Decliners on the Big Board totaled 1,530 issues-the highest since Oct. 13, when 1,600 Issues finished lower as the Dow industrials plummeted 190.58 points. In the latest session, only 255 issues moved higher.
Airline and trucking issues were hit the hardest in the latest sell off; the Dow Jones Transportation Average closed below 1,000 for the first time in 19 months, falling 58.76 to 980.29. The Dow Jones Utilities Average posted its biggest decline since mld-January, falling 4.78 to 204.92.
Volume totaled 240,400,000 shares-down from the 292,360.000 shares which changed hands Friday and the 253,090,000 traded Thursday, but still the third-highest total this year.
Overseas stock markets once again helped set the tone for Wall Street, as inflation and economic worries resulting from the rise in oil prices sent share prices. lower around the world. The 3.3% drop in the Dow industrials compared with the 3.1% loss posted by the Nikkei index of 225 Japanese issues and a 2.8% decline in the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index, a measure of London stock prices.
Within the first half-hour of trading on Wall Street, two Big Board "circuit breakers” designed to cushion market declines took effect:
-The so-called “uptick” requirement for stock-index arbitrage trading, which kicked in after the industrials had lost 50 points. After that point, traders had to wait until individual stocks rose in price before completing the stock side of arbitrage transactions.
-The "sidecar." a computer file which handled all program trading orders for S&P 500 stocks for a five-minute period. Once September S&P 500 futures showed a loss of 12 points, those orders were diverted to the file and then executed once the waiting period ended.
Market strategists at several Wall Street brokerage firms, reacting to the market s fall, recommended that investors move some assets out of stocks and into cash.
Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, doubled the cash portion of the firm's model portfolio to 10% and lowered his firm’s stock
weighting by five percentage points, to 45%. The other 45% remnlns in bonds.
Mr. Clough said he doesn't expect to 1 lower the stock allocation further, citing a : belief that Interest rates will soon head lower again and boost share prices. The market’s response to developments in the Middle East “Is getting a little extreme, so you've brought down stocks a long way in a short period of time," he added.
At Morgan Stanley, chief U.S. Investment strategist Byron R. Wien Increased the firm's recommended cash allocation to 20% from 15% and lowered Ills 1990 and 1991 earnings estimates for the S&P 500 stocks, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.
Joe Granville, the market pundit whose words used to make tens of thousands of investors snap to attention, is predicting a stock market crash within a few days.
He thinks the Industrial average will fall below 2200 by month's end and, before recovering in the spring of 1992, will drop below the October 1987 low of 1738.
Mr. Granville lost much of his once-vast following In the early 1980s, when he stubbornly refused to recognize the great bull market of 1982-1987. But he has made several astute market predictions since late 1987.
Oil stocks remained among the market's few bright spots as oil prices continued their rise, spurred by news that Iraqi troops were amassing near the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia border. September crude-oil futures surged 83.55 a barrel in New York trading to S28.05.
Exxon rose l'i to 54’4 in composite trading of 3.5 million shares. Other actively traded oil issues Included Phillips Petroleum, which jumped 17« to 31 on 2.1 million shares; Maxus Energy, which gained to 123s on 1.8 million shares; and Global Marine, which closed unchanged at 5‘t, as 2.2 million changed hands.
Elsewhere in the sector. Chevron added to 79’i. Texaco gained % to 65, Mobil rose 1’4 to 68. Amoco added to 57 ’» and Atlantic Richfield went up 3% to 137■».
Precious-metals issues, which have also been climbing since the Iraqi Invasion, drew continued buying interest as well. Homestake Mining rose l’» to 20%. Hecla Mining rose ■% to 12, Placer Dome added is to 17% and ASA Ltd. climbed 1 ’» to 50%.
But the run-up in defense stocks since Iraq’s invasion on Thursday began to falter. General Dynamics advanced 1 to 30 and Northrop added to 15%, but Raytheon, which is said to be selling or planning to sell Its Patriot missile system to Saudi Arabia and Israel, fell l'i to 62%.	|
UAL, the parent company of United Air- i lines, plunged 12’-z to 110 as the Thurs- ' day deadline for a union-led group to line ' up financing for its $4.38 billion buy-out proposal drew closer.
Other airline stocks also fell sharply amid news that Pan Am plans a 10% fare i increase as a result of soaring jet fuel | costs, tied to the rise in oil prices. Pan Am ' added % to 2’», but AMR. which owns I American Airlines, tumbled 4% to 50%; i Delta Air Lines fell 3% to 59%; Southwest Airlines dropped 3% to 22%, and USAlr ! Group slid 2‘« to 18%. Continental Airlines Holdings went down % to 4 in American Stock Exchange trading.
