Cotton is up. more than' 25% "and rubber around 100% from the figures at which -the company was a big purchaser.

w Helped along by renewed buoyancy in the commodities markets, prices for stocks and speculative bonds pressed upward yesterday. Gains in some of tbe leading stocks, like Allied Chemical, 'Union Pacific, Atchison, dq Font, U. S. Industrial Alcohol and National Distillers, ranged up to as much as six points, and in a long-list of issues advances of 2 points or more were chalked up. The alcohol stocks, agricultural implement shares and the railroad group led the advance.
The upward course of prices brought some enlargement of trading. The day's total ran to 2,560,000 shares, about double Tuesday's transactions. Trading was active early, died down and then picked up in the last half hour, when tbe list turned very strong.
The President's conferences with his monetary advisers were continued. No formal announcement was made in regard to the results of either Tuesday's or today's meetings, but both served to sharpen market interest. A statement from Hyde Park Indicated the President's satisfaction over the course of the Administration reemployment campaign.
’ In the realm of immediate business news, there was nothing exciting. Some of the corporate earnings reports, for the first half, attested to the dramatic turnabout in affairs of individual companies, like American Woolen and the tire companies. Individual carrier loadings reports showed traffic had eased somewhat in the latest week, but electric output figures were extremely good, recording a larger gain over the like 1932 week than in the two preceding weeks.
Rally Top Surpassed
Yesterday’s good upswing in stocks carried both the Dow-Jones railroad and industrial averages more than a full point through the -closing levels set—on the high point of the recovery after the drastic late July decline. The industrial average, at 99.06, was up three points from the July 27 close, while the rail average was only a little more than a full point through the July 27 finish of 48.31.
While the ability of both averages to push above the previous rally tops is indicative of the improved technical position of the market, as result of the brief resting period, it is not a conclusive move. There are nearby points in the averages, just over 100 for the industrials and between 50 and 51 for the rails, which probably will give the market a further and stiffer, test of its strength.

report, and
High-grade railroad bonds were laggards in a generally strong bond market. Speculative industrial and rail issues led the upturn, and utility bonds were in demand again. The foreign list was higher, in sympathy with the firmness In foreign currencies. Governments were dull.
The close found wheat very close to the day's tops, up 2% to 2^ cents a bushel. Other grains followed in the wake of the major cereal. The market was undisturbed by. the proximity of the Government crop report. Cotton gained $1.25 a bale, retracing almost ail the ground lost in the previous session.

Comparing With Better Times
One of the big factors in whetting interest in "stocks has been the percentage of improvement scored in recent periods over the corresponding weeks, or months, of 1932. Since early April when business has been rising comparisons have been made with a period in 1932 when industry, generally, was stagnating. From now on, weekly loadings and electric output figures will be contrasted with a period when “the trend was upward, and pretty sharply upward. It is possible, therefore, that percentage advances won't be as great, from 'how on, as they have been.
From the week ended August 12,	1932,
straight through to the week ended October 14, with the exception of the Labor Day week slump, carloadings staged a spectacular advance. Excepting the one break, each week's traffic scored an advance over the previous week. The upward movement in power output was equally well sustained. From the week ended August 13 through to the October 22 week the advance was sustained with only one interruption. The upward swings last summer and fall were in sharp contrast to tbe doleful declines which had been chalked up from late spring through to mld-June.
August May Better May
August, often a pretty dull month in many lines, holds no terrors for. some small businesses this year. The president of the Louisville Varnish Co., for instance, in his monthly letter, Informs employes of his belief that sales in August should surpass the May total, when the company had a very good month. In July sales were 118% over July, 1932, and the seasonal decline from June was the smallest in many years.
Hoarders Slow to Yield
The Treasury’s monthly figures on currency and gold coin and bullion holdings indicated that scant progress was made>during July, in persuading those who are clinging to their gold to turn it In to the government. Treasury’s holdings of gold coin and bullion were up only about $2,300,000 from the end of June. Since the close of May, however, the Treasury’s store of bullion and gold coin has climbed around 33%, moving up $1,100,000,000.
Actual money in circulation declined during the month to $5,629,712,686. To the advocates of using the printing presses to raise prices, the contrast between money in circulation now and a year ago, in view of the price level, must be a terrible blow. Circulation actually is almost $100,000,000 under the corresponding date of 1932, while the price level is up substantially.
Commodities and Company Reports
Reports of both American Woolen and tbe B. F. Goodrich Co. for the firpt half-year showed rhe market effect advancing commodity prices had on earnings of corporations whose affairs are closely linked with commodity price movements. American Woolen was in the black for the six months, the small profit comparing with a loss of $6,810,561 in the corresponding half of 1932. Goodrich had a profit of $870,577, against a loss of $710,821 in the corresponding period of 1932.
Both Goodrich and American Woolen had the benefit of rising prices for commodities, which made for higher prices for the goods they produced. Speculative demand for their products was Induced, too, by inflation talk. The firmness in raw materials was reflected in .American Woolen's Inventory adjustment for the period. This year the deduction from earnings for this item was only $236,060, compared with $3,304,559.
