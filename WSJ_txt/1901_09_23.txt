? i/was also a serious adverse influence. The close was ; ' generally above the lowest of the day, but substan-j* tial. declines were recorded in all the active issues.
* Amalgamated Copper showed a net decline of and Anncaonda lest 5?^. Among the other Ini’ dusdriais, United States Steel issues only lost M /.each, T. C. & I. declined lg^and Coloiado Fuel -American Sugar, ex-rights, declined 2g?f.
., • Of the principal railroad stocks St. Paul lost -il-g'f,. Northwestern 1?^ and Union Pacific 2^. / Southern'’Pacific declined 5'f on the day, Missouri -^Pacific and the other Gould issues were also " weak. ’-The hard coalers shared, to some extent, point or more in the Erie and Reading issues, the weakness in the general list, with declines of a .Tractions broke rather badly after a promising pponing, B. R. T. losing S.f't and Metropolitan 2'£. Manhattan closed at the previous night’s figures
-■••/and ig<g below the best, of the day. Money was
. easy throughout and was hardly a factor in the- ed on‘its intrinsic probability-. ■ ' market. London was a moderate seller.	. .....	•
.The Steel stocks were active and well bought
. " in spite of realizing in some volume.
The selling of St. Paul during the day was said . to have come from the Standard Oil following.
-	, From the opening of Sugar, it appeared that the market was taking the rights as worth 64;t. / The opening was somewhat irregular with con. niderable strength in Manhattan but a tendency to
realize elsewhere. .
-	It is figured that the Treasury surplus this fls-cal year may approximate close on $150,000,000, tinless txation is reduced.
. The Steel stocks held well in spite of the ; weakness elsewhere. Clark, Dodge & Co. were the principal buyers and there was no serious pressure.
The ease with which Missouri Pacific rallied in . ' the last few minutes was laken by room traders as an evidence that it was still a dangerous stock to sell short.
’	• Good buying was reported in Big Four. The
recent purchases arc believed to be based upon an intention of the controlling interest to put the stock on a 3$ basis in March.
The purchases of Manhattan by Butler Bros, kept that stock firm as this house is credited with trading for Gould interests, but Metropolitan and B. R. T. both acted weak.
All the rumors current on Amalgamated were Very bearish and among other stories it was said that the controlling interest hud been obliged to buy foreign copper to keep up the price.
London sold about 15,000 shares. Rumors were current, but unconfirmed of further unfavorable war news from South Africa, but tlie further small decline in Consols was probably due to ex-peetions of a new war loan.
The rather unfortunate pool in Southern Railway was suspected of dropping a lit tle stock yesterday. T1k‘ rumors of a change in the capitalization seem to have died a natural death, or at any rate are in a comatose condition.
Commission business during the day was rather small. It looked as if the little men were getting out of the marked until the trend of the eon- test, between the Standard Oil and Morgan-Gould interests was more apparent.
It is disappointing that the anthracite combinption has decided to discontinue its monthly reports on the state of production, it may of course strengthen their position but tin* Street is always nervous when it is kept in the dark.
It appears that the rate cutting in the northwest is not considerd serious on the spot, bv railroad mon. and will probably be adjusted this week. It. is a remnant of the contest: instituted by the Chicago Gt. Western some little time ago.
Nothing in the nature of dividend action is in the remotest degree probable at ihe Southern Fa cific metding to-day. It is suggested, however, that some official changes may be considered which will tend to the smoother and more economical working of the road.	•	.
Atchison was in some demand in the loan crowd at but with this exception stocks-were generally plentiful. The prevailing rate was 4/ to a little over.. Amalgamated Copper and United States Steel were not much mentioned but any 'borrower in quantity could have got plenty at 44 10 5V.
The continued heavy realizing in Amalgamated Copper in the face of stories that it was being put down to accumulate stock atul other standard excuses for a decline at last made its effect felt upon the rest .of the market. The tone was generally henvy and lower with good selling in the Grangers and Pacifies.	■ 'p•
The buying of Manhattan in the recent past 1ms been consistently good, but as traders constantly point out, is not the best in the world to follow for n market turn. Insiders talk of 150 for the stuck, and possibly lmve information on the prospected savings under electrical traction not accessible to the general public.	.	.
Southern Pacific was the room bull tip at ihe opening and some early purchases gave it consider-•able strength. To-day’s meeting was, of course, exploited to sonic extent, but the volume of long stock coming out was more than ljad been expected and
•	the price reacted substantially. The close, however, was well above lowest.
There was a fairly good day’s trading in bonds and a rather heavy tone in the .speculative issues. Burlington joint 4s, Union Pacific convertible 4s and Wabash debenture B all closed fractionally lower, on fairly large transactions. The geueriil railroad bond list: was steady and Government issues, where dealt in, a shade easier. Total sales,
. $2,575,000.	’
The categorical statement, of plans for Bnr-lington's survey right into the Union Pacific terr’:. tory at Salt Lake City, may contain the germ of serious market: considerations in the future, It lias . hithertobeen the impression that part, of Ihe treaty between the Harriman and Morgan interests wu« that Burlington should confine its energies to its own territories.
It was rumored Hint Anaconda would follow
•	■.the example of Amalgamated and pass the extra ;■ dividend on Wednesday. It is believed that there
will be no declaration on Tuesday. It is said that : the passing of the dividend in both companies will have been merely a temporary measure, and that extra payments may be resumed before the uext regular declarations.
It was noticeable that Atchison was very well " ‘sustained yesterday and it can be said that the buy-:■'ing has been uniformly good. There lias ibeen no /•sign of selling on'the part of the Berwind interest who were such large purchasers early in the sum -mer, and it is possible that the scarcity of stock
< -’duemore to the very limited Hosting supply rather Jtthnn to any inordinate short interest. .
■.It la estimated tjbat the Metropolitan system last
_ It was considered in the room that the Standard 'Oil interests were openly bearish on the market, and there was some sort of a contest between them and the Morgan and Gould following. The buying in Manhattan was considered to indicate the attitude of the latter. The Harriman interest was believed merely to be selling stocks on the strength, which were bought to protect the market on the two bad breaks in connection with the President’s death. .	.
Some of the early strength in Manhattan was ascribed to a continuance of the pool buying of Saturday and was supposed to have been made to some extent for the sake of its sympathetic effect on rhe rest of the market. Possibly when tliis was found to have -been over-estimated, t he price was allowed to react, taking the other Tractions with it. The buying of Butler Bros, gave a very genuine look to the operations, as they are credited with doing a good deal of the Gould business.
The rumor that Anaconda would pass the extra dividend, following the example of Amalgamated Copper, was possibly a guess, which was ace-’pt-........i"' “ 1	’ _ ’.	Indications may point that way, but if the Afnaeonda people take such a course, it will show that the passing of the Amalgamated extra dividend was not: on account of the injunction against the Boston & Montana dividend, but on the state of the copper trade. In these circumstances, the abrogation yf the extra 75 cents might tell too much. Its effect would certainly be felt in other stocks tlia.n Anaconda.	*
Ama’gamated Copper was again by far the most active stock, the transactions totalling more Ilian those of any three other issues on the list. li showed weakness from opening and declined altogether S points nt one time, although the close was a trifle above t lie lowest. There were of course plenty of bear rumors current, one of (hem being that the Amalgamated and its connections had been obliged to take much of the foreign stock of copper to maintain the price. There was some very fair buying after the slock broke 94. alt hough it was rather swamped by the heavy realizing from out-oftown operators, particularly'Boston. Most of the deliveries made yesterday came out of Boston names .	’
