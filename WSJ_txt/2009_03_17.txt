Stocks closed at their highs for the day after housing data helped continue the resurgence of banking stocks. Tech shares also recovered from a selloff.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 178.73 points, or 2.5%, to 7395.70, the highest close in almost a month. The S&P 500-stock index jumped 24.23 points, or 3.2%, to 778.12, its highest close since Feb. 19.
New government data showing that construction of new homes picked up in February spurred the gains. "There are some signs of life in the housing market, which is very important because that's the epicenter of a lot of the problems the market has," said Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx.
Financial stocks in the S&P jumped 6.5% as banks, including Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp and SunTrust Banks posted gains. Home Depot climbed 6.7%.
Cisco Systems led tech stocks, gaining 4.5% after announcing it will make computers aimed at corporate data centers. Microsoft rose 4% and Intel gained 4.6%.
Oil prices climbed just shy of $50 a barrel as options expired on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Dow's energy components, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, rose 3.2% and 3.8%, respectively.
Some investors are taking money out of bonds and putting it into bank stocks, said Sean Simko, head of SEI Fixed Income Management. Still, a flood of cash from Treasurys into stocks is unlikely until after the Federal Reserve announces a decision on interest rates on Wednesday. No change is expected in the rate target.
