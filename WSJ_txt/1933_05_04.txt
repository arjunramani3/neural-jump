stock aver-
Stocks were hesitant for the first half hour of trading yesterday, with volume relatively small, and then turned strong once more, pushing up to around the highs of the upswing. New tops were made by a number of issues. The oils turned in the best performance among the industrials, and carrier shares were uniformly higher. Trading was fast late in the day, and volume ran to 4,590,000 shares, just a little under Wednesday’s total.
Demand for bonds carried all groups of domestic corporation issues upward. In the second-grade rail list, a number of new highs were made, and even the highest grade rail obligations pushed ahead in good style. Industrial and public utility bonds were uniformly higher. German issues declined in the foreign department, but there was strength elsewhere in the list.
Trade news served as a cheerful background for the stock market. Reports of chain store company and mail order house sales in April were uniformly favorable, and served as a spur to bring about higher prices for a number of individual stocks. Submission of tbe Administration’s railroad program to Congress, including a section calling for repeal of the recapture .clause of “’the Transportation Act, helped the railroad shares. The action of the market itself, with trading volume slipping off during the periods when prices were easier, also served to bring new buying into stocks on every dip.
Grains became very strong after a slow start, with wheat leading the way. The major cereal finisheci up % to 1% cents a bushel, and corn closed around the tops of the day. Cotton finished up 2 to 9 points.
Strength was pronounced in the foreign markets. In Faris, prices on the Bourse were marked up sharply, with rentes advancing after their recent weakness. In London, the major of stocks turned in sizable gains.
up to a new high on the advance at 23. Huge blocks of the stock came out on the move, which carried the stock up more than two points from the day's low, set in the early dealings. Reports of higher motor production, increased car buying, and improvement in the refrigerator industry, in which Motors shares, through Frigidaire, helped to bring additional buying into the stock.
The Railroad Measure
The Administration’s railroad measure, as finally presented to Congress, differed only in a few points from the draft which already had been made public. luclusion of the retroactive recapture clause repeal and holding company regulation provisions was anticipated. These may cause some troubles for the measure in Congress, but chances for its passage now seem bright, in view of the support accorded the Administration on $ar more controversial matters.
The bill is a generally conservative measure, and should speed up the program of economies, and improvement of service, which the carriers ^themselves are putting into effect. The railroads, if the measure is enacted, will have the strong support of the government in this program, and they will have no alibis for not carrying it through.
The new rule for rate-making is complex, but the Interstate ommerce Commission should have no greater difficulty in abiding by its terms than it did in following those of the old rate-making regulations.

' Woolworth Sules Reflect Buying Upturn
Two factors entered into the dramatic improvement in Woolworth’s sales in April. The most important, perhaps, was the fact that the banking holiday in the first half of March took a heavy toll on the company’s business, and brought about a delay m the normal spring buying movement. There was a rush to buy after the resumption of normal banking facilities, felt in late March and the forepart of April. In addition. Easter fell m mid-April this y^r, while m 1932 it was in late March, so that preEaster buying was reflected in the company’s sales in a later month this year than m 1932.
The improvement in sales in April over March amounted to 14%. one of the sharpest gams scored by the company in month-to-month ligurcs m some time. The decline from the like month of 1932 was cut to 2.8%. the narrowest gap in the month-to-month comparison in many months.
Woolworth’s soles arc quick to reflect changes in the general business trend. A continuation of the good April showing through May would be regarded as highly favorable. While Woolworth has shared m the rise in prices for equities, buying in the stock has not been so aggressive as m some of the other chain and department store company issues. The possibility that the initial effect of advances in goods prices might be adverse for the company, because of its fixed price policy, has exercised a restraining influence.
The Muscle Shoals Bill
Substitution by the Senate of the Norris Bill covering the plan for development of the Muscle Shoals territory for the Hill Bill which passed the House is indicative of the drift in the upper branch of Congress toward the utilities. The Norris Bill gives the proposed power authority far wider powers than those granted under the Hill Bill, particularly, in regard to the building by the government agency of transmission lines. It was this latter section of the Muscle Shoals measure which drew the major fire of the utilities companies.
Action of the Senate on the Norris measure was disturbing to some close to the utility situation. It revealed a trend of thought toward the utilities in the Upper House hardly helpful to the utility companies. The House bill, calling for a shift of the burden of the 3% tax on electric power from the consumers to the utility companies is still before the Senate for action.
Newcomer on the Big Board
Trading in Sperry Corp, on the "Big Board" got under way on Wednesday, and there was a big market in the stock in the first session, with 22,000 shares changing hands between 3 and 2’*. Sperry is an outgrowth of the North American Aviation-General Aviation merger. When the .merger was put thro.ugh, certain assets of North American Aviation, including the Sperry Gyroscope Co., Ford Instrument Co., stock holdings in Curtiss Wright Corp, and in Interccji-tinent Aviation were segregated into a separate company, voting trust certificates in which were issued to North American ^stockholders on a sharc-for-shara basis. Sperry and Ford, the two major units in the company, specialize in the manufacture of many patented instruments for tho aviation and other industries. • They include the gyro-compass, gyro-stabilizer, gunfire control equipment, searchlights and the like. They were tho mainstays of North Anperican’s earning power in 1929 and 1930.
The Sperry Corp, has 1,949,111 shares outstanding. of 51 par value. Total assets amount to $6,250,965. Ct rront assets, as of February 28. Inst, amounted to $2,820,346, of which $811,917 was in cash. Current1 liabilities were $265,717.
