The government's latest bailout of a financial firm helped drive the stock market to its biggest two-day gain in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 396.97 points, or 4.9%, to 8443.39. Combined with Friday's 494-point rise, the Dow has risen nearly 12% in two days, the biggest percentage gain since the two days immediately following the 1987 crash.
Citigroup, which received a government cash injection and debt guarantee, led the Dow higher Monday. It jumped nearly 58%, though the shares still finished below where they were last Wednesday. Bank of America rose 27% and J.P. Morgan Chase was up 21%.
But there was more grim news about the housing market, and traders warned the rally could be a short-term bounce after big declines Wednesday and Thursday.
The dollar sagged and Treasury yields remained stubbornly low amid concern that the U.S. economy is still in for a lot of pain. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six denominations, slumped 1.8%. The dollar fell 2.5% against the euro.
Although long-dated Treasury prices slipped as investors piled into stocks, three-month bills remained steady, with yields hovering near zero -- a sign that some investors remain so risk averse they will accept almost nothing in return for government guarantees.
"There's an entirely different tempo to the market right now," with lulls of scant trading volume and bursts of activity when news breaks, said Ray Cahnman, chairman of TransMarket Group, a proprietary-trading firm active in Chicago's interest-rate markets. "Guys are doing whatever trades they have to do -- maybe hedging the positions they already have on -- and they're getting out."
Oil futures jumped more than 9%, to $54.50 a barrel, as speculative buyers returned, looking for quick gains. Crude and other commodities also benefited from the dollar's slide.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 6.5% to 851.81, led by its financial sector, up almost 16%.
The National Association of Realtors reported that the pace of existing-home sales slid 3.1% in October from September. The median home price tumbled 11.4%, the biggest drop since the association began keeping records in 1969.
