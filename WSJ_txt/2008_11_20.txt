The stock market's brutal fall reached a new landmark Thursday as the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index breached its low from the last bear market and landed back where it was in the spring of 1997, marking a 52% decline from its peak.
Investors fled to the safest securities, driving up prices of some Treasury bonds to their highest levels in more than 35 years. They sold corporate and real estate bonds and oil, sending crude-oil futures below $50 to $49.62, the lowest settle in 3 1/2 years. Crude futures are down almost 66% from their July record of $145.29.
"Everyone is saying, 'Just give me government bonds and give me cash.'" said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York.
Part of the problem was the Treasury Department's recent decision not to buy the troubled mortgage-backed debt it once planned to purchase. Banks that are believed to hold the toxic debt saw their stocks hammered. Citigroup fell 26% to less than $5 a share.
Banks unleashed more layoffs. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. began handing out pink slips on Thursday to employees in its massive investment bank. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. announced that it was cutting its worldwide work force by 4%, or 1,800 jobs.
Demand for safe short-term Treasury bills became so heavy that the yield of the three-month and one-month Treasury bills fell to just 0.04%, almost nothing. The yield of the two-year Treasury note fell to 1.01%, its lowest late-day level in more than 35 years.
The S&P 500, against which hundreds of billions of dollars in index funds are invested, now has given up all the gains of the 2002-2007 bull market and a big part of the gains of the late 1990s. It fell 54.14 points, or 6.7%, to 752.44, pushing it below its lowest finish in the 2000-2002 bear market that followed the technology-stock collapse, which had been 776.76.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is less exposed than the S&P 500 to financial stocks, was pounded, but hasn't fallen as far. It declined 444.99 points, or 5.56%, to 7552.29, its lowest finish since March 2003, 5 1/2 years ago.
If the S&P 500 were to finish the year where it was on Thursday, it would mark an annual decline of 48.8%, the worst annual percentage drop in its 80-year history. In all, the index is down 52% from its record finish of just over one year ago. That means that the S&P has fallen more in the current bear market than it did in the horrendous bear market from 2000-2002, when it fell 49%.
The Dow is off 47% from last year's record, its heaviest decline since the bear market of 1937-1938, when it fell 49%. It is down 43% for the year so far. If it doesn't improve, that would make this the second-worst yearly pullback since it was launched in 1896. The worst was 1931, when it fell 53%.
Some traders said stock selling in recent days may have been magnified by late-day margin calls, or forced selling by firms and individuals who had borrowed money using stock as collateral. When the stock value falls below the value of the loan, the investors can be forced to sell and repay the loan.
On Wednesday, J. Downey Bridgewater, the president and chief executive of Houston-based Sterling Bancshares Inc., reported selling $247,500 in company shares to meet a margin call.
Also contributing to the decline is concern that the government's decision to inject capital directly into major banks isn't working. Since nine major financial companies agreed on Oct. 14 to accept partial government ownership, their stocks are down an average of 46%. Some investors said they wished the government had carried out its initial plan to buy troubled assets from the banks.
"I had three clients who demanded that everything get sold," said Gary Schatsky, a financial planner in New York City, "and I was successful [in talking them out of it] with only one out of three. And these were people who had less than one-third of their portfolios in stocks. They all said basically the same thing: 'I can't take it, I can't sleep, I can't deal with it.'"
"This is a crisis of confidence," said Andy Brooks, head of stock trading at Baltimore money-management firm T. Rowe Price. "The marketplace is somewhat frustrated by what seems to be a lack of progress in solving the problem. People saw the Big Three auto makers leaving Washington with their hands empty, and there is the question of when the TARP [the Treasury Department's rescue program] is going to filter into the economy in terms of money being spent and goods being purchased."
As for the heavy selling of Citigroup, once the largest U.S. banking company, he said, "It is unfathomable. It is hard to process the sight of that kind of movement in a
company that big."

Another unusual sight on Thursday was the first initial public offering of stock in nearly four months. Online college Grand Canyon Education ended the day down just 1.3%,
far outperforming the overall market.
Until Grand Canyon braved the waters, the market hadn't gone longer than two months without an IPO since 1974, according to data from University of Florida Professor Jay Ritter.
IPOs "are basically frozen," says Tom Crotty, a venture capitalist at Battery Ventures. "It's extremely painful for everyone."
Among the venture-backed companies that withdrew IPOs this week were: biotechnology company ChemoCentryx Inc. and BlueArc Corp., which makes software and gear to store corporate data. Louis Gray, director of corporate marketing at BlueArc, said the move was "absolutely due to market conditions." He added, "No one is going out in this environment."
The stock-market downdraft has hobbled some acquisition plans. ON Semiconductor Corp. on Tuesday said it was backing out of its plan with Microchip Technology Inc. to buy rival chip maker Atmel Corp. for $2.3 billion in cash, in an unsolicited offer opposed by Atmel.
