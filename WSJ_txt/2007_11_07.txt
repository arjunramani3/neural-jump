The stock market's "fear gauge" marched higher as credit market concerns continued to spook investors.
"There is concern about financial stocks, rising crude-oil prices and its potential drag on the economy, and the low U.S. dollar," said Frederic Ruffy, an Optionetics analyst. "The broader economic trends are causing concern."
With financial stocks performing poorly yesterday, Jon Najarian at OptionMonster noted the spread between the VIX and the Nasdaq 100 volatility index, or VXN, which reflects market sentiment about the Nasdaq, has narrowed.

The stock market's "fear gauge" marched higher as credit market concerns continued to spook investors.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market-volatility index soared 5.1 points, or 23.8% to 26.49, after rising as high as 26.85, a level not seen since mid-September.
The VIX is derived from options on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and is an important measure of market expectations of near-term volatility.
The index stormed higher as the S&P 500 tumbled 2.94% to 1475.62 as investors also digested soaring oil prices.
"There is concern about financial stocks, rising crude-oil prices and its potential drag on the economy, and the low U.S. dollar," said Frederic Ruffy, an Optionetics analyst. "The broader economic trends are causing concern."
With financial stocks performing poorly yesterday, Jon Najarian at OptionMonster noted the spread between the VIX and the Nasdaq 100 volatility index, or VXN, which reflects market sentiment about the Nasdaq, has narrowed.
The VXN, which typically sits well above the VIX, rose 3.23 points to 27.14 in the falling market.
That the gap between the two indexes has shrunk suggests traders see more risk in big components of the S&P 500 such as financial stocks and home builders than they do in the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100.
Jittery investors may have sent stocks lower yesterday, but Mr. Ruffy still noted speculative trading on some stocks, including BEA Systems Inc.
As traders continue to ponder whether BEA's days as an independent company are numbered, almost 18,300 call options on the stock changed hands, compared with only 1,300 put options, according to Track Data.
As BEA Systems shares rose 20 cents to $17.08, many traders zeroed in on November $17.50 calls, which expire in seven trading days.
