An Appraisal: Portfolio Managers' Grow More Positive Despite Woes
Abreast of the Market
By Victor J. ffiunr
Tbs dead* hanging over the stock market pw more gknrering, hot some portfolio manasen aren’t running tor shelter.
“As the panic sets in we’re getting more and more positive,” asserts Eugene C. 8U, vice pretfdent and senior portfolio manager at Investors Diversified Services Inc. The market recently has “ignored the good news and, therefore, probably win test the 750 area ot the Dow Janes industrial average," he says. But during the past two weeks, he adds, “we’ve seen some basic industry stocks correcting, which usually is a sign at the tail end ot a general market correction."
The IDS mutual-fund complex, which watches over investments ot $5.5 billion, thinks the market “hasn’t discounted the current economic recovery" and it looks for the industrial average to reach a new recovery high next year. The cash positions of its portfolios are “mostly 5% to 10%, with some a little higher," he says.
“Our assumption is that real (gross national product) growth in the last half at 1975 will be at an annual rate of 4% to 5% and about 5% in 1975," Mr. 8it says. “The major constraints to more rapid growth are inflation, availability of capital and energy resources, and economic adjustments from higher prices for both food and energy," he adds.
He looks for Inflation (as measured by the consumer price index) to recede from a rate of about 9% to 10% in the third quarter to 7.5% in the current quarter and average 6J5% in 1976. He sees shortterm interest rates moving higher and
long-term rates stabilizing in the 9% area.
“While we are attracted to 9% bonds, we believe that common stocks also are attractive," says Mr. Sit. Observing that the industrial average currently is selling at about 8.4 times his estimated total 1976 per-share earnings ($95) for its 30 components, he suggests that the "range for the ratios in the future would be eight to 11 times earnings." And he says that "dividends of 4% plus for the market average and earnings growth of about 10% annually (four percentage points real growth and six points inflation) after 1976 would bring the investor a return of about 15% annually In stocks."
His recommendation for a pension fund’s current portfolio mix is 35% bonds and 65% equities, with the equity portion consisting of 50% total-return (growth plus dividend) stocks, 40% growth companies and 10% small- and medium-sized companies.
The market “isn’t likely to show any particular direction for the balance of 1975,” contends R. Patterson Warlick, partner of Lord, Abbett & Co., which directs more than $1.5 billion in four funds.
"The pressure of high' short-term interest rates and inflationary tendencies is putting a lid on the ability of the market to show any upward movement,” he says.
But he also sees the market “building a base as the economy experiences a protracted period of adjustment—corporations adjusting to higher costs and individuals to price increases." And this will lead, he suggests,' to "reduced inflation and some Improvement in securities markets." Lord Abbett’s Affiliated Fund is “fully invested.” •
Estimating that Teal GNP grew at a 9% rate in the third quarter, he thinks this pace'won’t continue. The third quarter, he says, felt the impact "of the huge fiscal stimulus which doesn’t have a large carry-through ” And the recovery will be damped, he adds, by high interest rates and inflation’s constraints on consumer confidence and spending.
Mr. Patterson also looks for some

“upward movement in short-term interest rates” and for relative stability in longterm rates with a decline in 1976. He is projecting a profit rise next year of about 25% and an inflation rate of 5%%.
Inverness Counsel Inc., which manages about $400 million, is maintaining in most of its accounts "a little more cash then we did last spring, purely because of the high level of interest rates," says Robert S. Waill, vice president. Such rates, he explains, are "a short-term negative for stocks and also add to the attractiveness of alternative fixed-income Investments.” But “we believe that over the next few years the equity market will do very well,” he adds.
He expects further progress to be made in controlling inflation. He cites the stronger dollar, which causes foreign goods to enter the U.S. at lower prices, the availability of labor and plant facilities being reflected in wages and product prices, and "the generally steady and rational approach of the Federal Reserve." On Friday, the Fed was rumored to be switching to an easier monetary policy.
Squeezing out inflation, he observes, also is disclosing weakness in the nation’s debt structure. These, he says, are appearing in municipalities and in real estate rather than in corporations, apart from a few notable instances. The Fed, he suggests, will be deterred from “an overly tight monetary policy” by the “need to avoid a crisis of confidence about the safety of debt.” He believes, too, that “most large corporations are already over the hump , with respect to their'liquidity problems'■ 'and that their" balance sheets' "should continue to strengthen.” ■
