The Dow industrials closed at 8607.52 after yesterday's 3.19% leap, which in addition to its place in first-day history was also the biggest one-day gain in point or percentage terms since Oct. 15. The Nasdaq composite jumped 49.34 points, or 3.69%, to 1384.85, while the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 29.21 points, or 3.32%, to 909.03.
U.S. government bonds, on the other hand, plummeted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1 29/32 points, or $19.0625 for every $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to 4.055% from 3.82%, the sharpest jump for the yield since December 2001.
The biggest opening day ever was in 1988, the year after the 1987 crash, when the Dow rose 3.94%. The Dow went on to a gain of 11.85% that year. But the second biggest opening day was in 1931, when the average was up 3.2% on Jan. 2 but wound up falling 53% for the year.

AFTER SUFFERING ITS worst yearly performance in 25 years, the stock market turned on its heel and began the new year with one of its strongest opening days ever.
Yesterday's 3.19%, or 265.89-point, surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average marked the third-biggest opening-day percentage gain ever for the industrial average, created in 1896. The only bigger ones were the record 3.94% gain in 1988, and a 3.20% first-day gain back in 1931.
Rebounding technology stocks drove the Nasdaq Composite Index up 3.69%, that index's strongest start since it was created in 1971. The big U.S. stock day helped stimulate gains in many foreign markets as well.
The catalyst was the release of data showing December manufacturing activity stronger than expected, ending a three-month decline. Cautious money managers who last month had moved to the relative safety of government bonds suddenly felt obliged to race out of bonds and back to stocks -- provoking the sharpest Treasury-bond selloff in more than a year. The dollar rose.
The sudden turnaround marked yet another of the lurches that have afflicted the stock market for three years, and which just last month had sent the Dow industrials down 6.2%, their biggest December decline since 1931.
Although volume was moderate, the gains were across the board, with 29 of the 30 Dow-industrial stocks rising.
Whether the recovery is a one-day wonder or a sustainable event remained a matter of debate, but for now, investors are breathing a sigh of relief. "The positive manufacturing news took people by surprise," said Dennis Ferro, chief investment officer at Evergreen Investments, Wachovia's mutual-fund unit. "People are back at work" from the holiday, "and they are feeling better about how the year looks. The data are suggesting that there may be a little bit more economic strength out there than people expected."
The Dow industrials closed at 8607.52 after yesterday's 3.19% leap, which in addition to its place in first-day history was also the biggest one-day gain in point or percentage terms since Oct. 15. The Nasdaq composite jumped 49.34 points, or 3.69%, to 1384.85, while the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 29.21 points, or 3.32%, to 909.03.
The one-day gain followed a drop of 17% last year for the industrials, the blue-chip average's sharpest loss since 1977, and a slide of 32% for the Nasdaq composite.
U.S. government bonds, on the other hand, plummeted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1 29/32 points, or $19.0625 for every $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to 4.055% from 3.82%, the sharpest jump for the yield since December 2001.
"It was pretty much across the board, and whatever the stocks did, the bonds went the other way," said Robert Harrington, head of listed trading at brokerage firm UBS.
But the stock market has been through so much in recent years that many professional investors remain unconvinced that stocks are poised for a lasting rebound. Since peaking early in 2000, broad stock indexes have repeatedly staged huge one-day advances, only to give back all the gains and more.
This time, despite the big stock advance, Big Board trading volume hit only 1.23 billion shares, below last year's average of 1.46 billion, suggesting that many investors remain on the sidelines.
One reason for the recovery, traders said, was that recent comments from United Nations inspectors and Washington officials have suggested any military action in Iraq could be postponed until the end of this month at the soonest.
"Any conversation that indicates that there will be a political solution as opposed to a military solution is good for the market," Mr. Ferro of Evergreen said.

On top of that, he and others noted, the market was overdue for a recovery after its abysmal December. The last two weeks of December normally are the best period of the
year for stocks, as investors anticipate the inflow of new retirement money into stocks at the beginning of the year. With that period weak last year, a rebound had to
happen some time.
Some traders say the recovery could continue as long as the Iraq war appears to be on hold. "You could see it building on itself a little bit in the coming days, depending on how imminent this Iraq thing seems to be," Mr. Harrington of UBS said. One big hurdle for the market will be the release of fourth-quarter corporate earnings later this month, he added. "Earnings are still probably going to hold the market back a little bit in the near term. We aren't going back to the bull market of the '90s," he said.
He predicted that the Dow industrials could continue to bounce up and down in a range of 8200 to 9000, and added that some money managers and traders won't be back from vacation until Monday.
Despite the strong December manufacturing numbers, jobless claims last week were higher than expected, suggesting the economy remains uncertain. And U.S. oil inventories fell sharply in the week through Dec. 27, according to the Department of Energy.
"One of the issues that the market is going to struggle with here for a while is, do we really have an economic expansion or not," said Robert Morris, chief investment officer at fund-management group Lord Abbett in Jersey City, N.J. He said he thinks the economy will gradually show that it is recovering and will pull the stock market up with it. "The manufacturing data obviously were much stronger than anyone was expecting," he noted.
The big stock gain seemed all the more significant because, historically, the year's first day of trading hasn't been that strong. From 1945 through last year, the Dow industrials had averaged a gain of just 0.09%, rising on only 31 opening days and falling on 27, according to WSJ Market Data Group.
Unfortunately, a good opening-day performance doesn't always presage a strong year.
The biggest opening day ever was in 1988, the year after the 1987 crash, when the Dow rose 3.94%. The Dow went on to a gain of 11.85% that year. But the second biggest opening day was in 1931, when the average was up 3.2% on Jan. 2 but wound up falling 53% for the year.
Since 1945, the Dow has followed an opening-day rise with a yearlong gain 24 times, and on seven occasions has followed an opening-gain with a decline.
