Abreast of the Market
Bv George Anders
A last-hour buying spree sent stock prices to their highest-Ievels this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 21.88 points to 891.17. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the second heaviest ever, after last Wednesday’s record.
The market was spurred by further declines in interest rates. Dozens of banks lowered their prime, or base, lending rate to 13%% from 14%. and some short-term interest rates continued to ease. Market watchers added that the recent rally is feeding on itself, as more investors rush to buy stocks, fearful of missing a major market move.	'
After last week’s 81.24-point leap in the Dow Jones industrials, there were expectations of profit-taking at the start of yesterday’s session, said Lee H. Idleman. director of research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The industrial average “was down five points near the opening,” Mr. Idleman noted, "and there were a couple more moves down. But the market did what good markets do; it digested the profit-taking and kept moving up.”
At the close, the Dow Jones industrials were at their highest level since 892.03 last Dec. 10. Prices on the American Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter markets, which had lagged last week, rose sharply yesterday. The Dow Jones Transportation Average climbed 13.27 to 337.31, but the utility index eased slightly.
Yesterday's Big Board volume of more than 110 million shares was second only to last Wednesday’s
132.7	million. Banks, pension funds and other big institutions paced last week's trading, but several brokerage	houses
yesterday	said
smaller, individual investors were joining the buying stampede.
Barry Snowbarger, head of trading at the discount-brokerage firm of Charles Schwab & Co., said retail volume yesterday was at least double the usual pace and tilted heavily toward buy orders. Last week’s passage of the tax bill, the decline in interest rates and the sharp market rise “have a lot of people in a euphoric mood,” he said.
Advances led declines about four to one on the Big Board. Some of the biggest gains were posted by aerospace, drug, rail, tobacco, computer and auto stocks, while laggards included many steel, bank, utility, publishing and building-product issues.
The market’s advance already has confounded many participants, and one trader at a major brokerage house said he was braced for more surprises. With investors looking for a sell-off yesterday, “naturally, the market went up,” he said. “As soon as we believe the rally, the market probably will go down 10%.”
Institutions again were extremely active in yesterday’s market, as indicated by the 2,082 trades of 10,000 shares or more. That was up from Friday’s 1,821 and second only to last Wednesday’s 2,456.
Active Issues
Nine stocks each traded more than one million shares yesterday. Exxon, the volume leader at nearly two million shares, rose % to 28%. Retailing stocks continued to draw heavy buying; among active stocks. Sears rose 1% to 23, Tandy climbed 2 to 27% and K mart gained % to 20%.
Cities Service was among the few big decliners, slipping 2% to 42%; Amerada Hess said it may buy some of the oil company’s operations, but sources say Hess hasn’t made any offer yet. Hess rose % to 19%.
