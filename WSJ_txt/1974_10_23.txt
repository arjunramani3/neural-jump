By Vktoh J Himxi

Brokers again cited news this week that durable-goods orders last month slid 6 4' the steepest drop in more than 6‘-_ years, and that consumer prices in September surged at a 14 4'1 annual rale. "These two items underscore the current stagflation and indicate we have the worst of all jiossi-ble worlds," commented I^irry Wachtel, vice president of Bache & Co
The industrial average, which had fallen 6 96 points on Tuesday after a three-session rally, yesterday tumbled another 11.26 points In the first half hour After a couple of feeble tries to reveise direction, it finished at 645.03. The transportation index also dropped sharply and the utility average was down. too.
New York Stock Exchange losers overwhelmed gainers by better than four-to-one with 1,139 stocks down and 280 up.
Another major depressant on the market. brokers said, was concern about a coal strike next month, even though talks between the industry and the United Mine Workers were making slow but steady progress.
Alexander Bing in. research partner of L.F. Rothschild & Co , said the market’s rapid advance earlier this month "made it very vulnerable to a reversal." He said, too, that it would be "unreasonable to expect weakness in the economy and doubledigit inflation to both continue for a protracted period.” His firm’s view of the six-to-12 month outlook, he said, is that “while we’re probably in a recession that will last through a good part of 1975 current stock prices have more than discounted that kind of thing ”
Big Board volume slowed to 14,200.000 shares from 18,930,000 on Tuesday. Trades of 10,000 shares or more, a measure of institutional activity, declined to 83 from 111 in the prior session.
The American Stock Exchange index slipped 1.14 to 68 59 and stocks that declined led the gainers by better than two-to-one. Activity slackened to 1,560,000 shares from 2,260.000 on Tuesday.

Bond prices also lost ground Prime corporates dropped about % point and long-term governments about 5-32 point in the over-the-counter market.
Stocks that retreated on the Big Board included auto, oil, airline, housing, chemical, computer, copper, retail, drag, electronic, machinery, paper, rubber, steel and savings-and-loan issues. Gold issues gained.
Auto stocks led the Big Board’s actives. Ford, in the top spot, slid 1% to SlV.; the company reported car sales in the eight-day mid-October period declined to 53,303 from 73,277 in 1973’s comparable nine-day period.

A 125,000-share block of Ford, handled by Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan, traded at 31.
Oil stocks were weakened, brokers said, partly because of a statement by a White House spokesman that President Ford believes "current profit levels of some unnamed U.S. oil companies" emphasize the need for a windfall-profits tax. One brokerage firm immediately declared “a shortterm buying moratorium" on oil stocks.
Exxon dropped 2% to 66%. Texaco
