AFTER EARLY DIP
Washington Report That High er Prices Still Are Being Sought Causes Upturn
Cotton futures Wednesday turned in their ■best performance in weeks, after selling off into new low ground in the early part of the session. At the day's highs the market showed advances of 51.50 a bale from the low. Strength in stocks and grains was an important factor in the advance. The underlying.- cause of the upturn, however, was the report from Washington that the Administration was still seeking higher prices. When the significance of this statement became apparent to traders, buying power showed a sharp improvement. Wall Street houses were aggressive buyers on the upturn. Closing prices were 10 to 17 points higher with December at 12.19, up ^7 points.
On the advance, there was good buying by houses which peviously had been steady sellers. Whether this represented new buying or short covering could not be determined, however.
Selling on the call came mostly from spot houses, the South, and cooperatives. Trade buying was better than in some time. New Orleans, professionals, the Far Bast and shorts also bought.
Demand did not increase sharply, but as the market was well liquidated it was easily influenced. At the low point December touched 11.92 cents, the lowest price since June 1.
The weekly weather report showed generally favorable conditions throughout the belt and was bearishly construed by the trade.
The current weather map revealed generally cloudy and rainy conditions in the central and eastern sections of the belt. It was generally fair in the West. Birmingham received 5.34 inches of rain, Pensacola 3.04; Meridian 2.68; New Orleans 2.3S; Vicksburgh 2.42; Asheville 1.41 and Charlotte 1.26.
Exports for the day totaled 19,425 bales, compared with 28,486 a year ago. Of the total 6.571 went to Great Britain, 2.242 to the Continent and 10,612 to date, exports with 1,690,281 in
Port receipts 44.857 last year. So far amount to 1,503,316 bales, 420,359 last season. Port stocks total 2,911,962 bales, against 3,652,731 at this time last year.
