Abreast of the Market
Wall Street Journal (1923 - Current file); Nov 7, 1946;
ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Wall Street Journal pg. 13
Stock prices broke sharply yesterday. There was not sufficient new buying to take care of a large volume of profit taking. The industrial average closed at 168.S8, off 5.52. This erased 54% of the rally in the four previous sessions. Railroads closed at 48.62, off 2.48, which also eliminated more than 50% of the previous four days’ advance. Utilities reacted in about the same fashion.
The weak market yesterday was a distinct disappointment to Wall Street. Those who had bought stocks in anticipation of the Republican victory found a pretty thin market in which to take t»rofits.
The Street felt that the election results would be helpful to business for the longer pull. Brokers believed, however, that a Republican Congress was apt to have deflationary economic ideas. While this was regarded as constructive eventually, it might have temporary market reverberations.
Weakness in commodity markets, too, accelerated selling in securities.
Leading stocks were off from 1 to 7 points from Monday’s close.

Solar Manufacturing Corp.—’
Sales of Solar Manufacturing Corp., a leading maker of condensers used in fluorescent lights, radios and other electronic items, t will exceed $8 million this year, it appears . likely. This will more than triple the pre-war j sales peak of $2.2 million, but will fall short > of the wartime record of $13 9 million made ! in 1944. Earnings this year are expected to I approximate or top the 93 cents a common -share reported for 1945. when fewer common ' shares wore outstanding. As a result of con- ! versions by preferred stockholders the number ' of common shares -now outstanding exceeds 300.000. compared with the 276,773 shares out- ‘ standing at the dose of 1945. Meantime, the ; company’s large-scale expansion program, an- i nounced earlier this year, is proceeding slowly. | It will not be speeded up until its planned financing, which has been held xn abeyance because of market conditions, is completed. The plan calls for an authorization by stockholders of 200.000 shares of a new preferred, of which Solar plans to issue 80.000 shares of $112*3 cumulative convertible preferred. Series A.

Thfrmoid Co.—
Sales of Thcrmoid Co. and subsidiaries in September increased nearly 40% over the like month of last year. For the first nine months of this year, however, net sales were some 10% below those of the like 1945 period. In connection with the'decline in the nine months, it is pointed out that during the first half, two units were disposed of by the company. These were the Thermoid Co of California and the Stokes Rubber Co. of Trenton. N J. The manuafacture of products formerly produced by Thermoid Co. of California has been handled by other plants, but products formerly produced by the. Stokes Rubber Co are. for the greater part, not being continued as a part of the Thermoid line. Sales of the parent Thermoid Co in Trenton, since April, it is understood, have ’ of a year ago. Company that steady sales gains have products manufactured for industry industrial

to a low of about 10re of capacity and held at that ratef until the power strike ended on October 20. Demand for the company’s products is described by officials as “very strong.” Unless operations are again reduced by strikes or other causes during the remainder of this year. Superior should make a comparatively good showing in the final quarter. With net profits of $673,423, or $4.SO a share, reported for the first nine months of this year, it is certain that the results for the full year will be much more than double those of 1945, when the net was $280,970. or S2.4S a share.

Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co.—
Merger of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. and Pere Marquette Railway Co., controlled by the C. & O , is believed to have been brought considerably nearer completion by approval of the Bureau of Finance of the I C.C. Such a merger was a part of the plan for consolidation of railroads which the I.C.C advanced in 1921 and revised in 1929 and 1932 Assuming a price of 100 for the new preferred stock which C. & O. would create in the event of a merger, and 50 for the present common. Pere Marquette issues have failed to reach their indicated exchange values. The Pere Marquette’s prior preference stock would receive one share of new C. A O. preferred and one-third common share, about $117 total value; the preferred, eight-tenths share of new preferred and four-tenths share of common. $100 value: and the common one-half share of common. $25 value.
Since C. A O. owns 70% of Pere Marquette common and 16^7 of its junior preferred shares, the merger would necessitate issuance to the public of only 195.469 shares of new preferred and 147,342 additional shares of common. With the annual dividend rate on C A O preferred $3.50, and assuming the present $3 rate on common, there would be exchanged *	“*	*

Its special feature would be the privilege of conversion at any time into common stock on a 1 6 to 1 basis. The preferred would not be callable prior to November 1, 1950.

Public Service Co. of Colorado-
Public Service Co. of Colorado reported a net income for the first nine months this year approximately $1,492,000 greater than for the comparable 1945 period. This better showing resulted solely from the elimination of the excess profits tax, since revenues for the period were practically unchanged from the preceding year. Receipts from the sale of electricity in the first three quarters this year were $888,965 ahead of the like 1945 period. Gas consumption by volume rose 12.4%, but a rate reduction caused a $909,736 drop in revenues for this division. Operating expenses have increased sharply and for the nine months ended September 30 were $436,000 above last year.
In a recent letter to stockholders, the management called attention to this trend, stating that ’’each month’s operating costs, exclusive of Federal income taxes and the cost of purchased gas. give evidence of the ever-increasing cost of doing business. These increases directly reflect the rise in wage levels and increased cost of coal, materials and supplies, and also the increase in operating personnel to carry on the many essential activities temporarily abandoned during the war years, such as maintenance, meter testing. and repairs, load surveys, etc.” Operating costs recently were increased $550,000 a year by a 10% hourly wage increase. It was retroactive to June 1.
Scott Paper—
Scott Paper Co. officials still are negotiating with insurance company representatives for a settlement of property damage and loss of use and occupancy caused by an explosion at its Chester, Pa., plant September 11. The use and occupancy insurance provides for pay, ment of a fixed daily sum if the entire plant is closed down, and a percentage of that sum I for partial suspension of production. The policy ! covers the entire plant on a seven-day-a-week operating basis It is understood that an agreement has been reached with insurance
representatives on the principles involved. Scott Paper’s earnings statement for the nine months ended September 28 showed a third quarter net profit of $356,120 against $523,898 In the second and $474,070 in the first quarter this year. For the first nine months of 1946, net earnings were $1,354,084 compared with $1,270,415 in the like 1945 period. The reduction in taxes was greater than the increase in earnings for the nine I months.
