Stocks surged, as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite Index each gained more than 200 points -- only the second time that such a one-two punch has occurred this year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 218.72, or 2.01%, to 11124.82, the first time it closed above the 11000 milestone since April 12. The industrial average is still well off its record of 11722.98. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 228.75 to 3711.23 -- its second-biggest point gain on record. Meanwhile, bonds fell back as investors snapped up stocks.
The only other time the industrial average and the Nasdaq Composite each climbed by more than 200 points on the same day this year was a week ago Monday, when both were snapping back from the Frightful Friday plunges in both indexes. Indeed, only 10 times this year have both major indexes risen even 100-plus points on the same day, let alone 200.

Corrections & Amplifications
THE DOW JONES INTERNET Index at Tuesday's close was down 31.94% for the year to date. A Money & Investing article in some editions yesterday misstated the year-to-date decline as 9.72%. (WSJ April 27, 2000)
Stocks surged, as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite Index each gained more than 200 points -- only the second time that such a one-two punch has occurred this year.
Nasdaq's 6.57% rally more than made up for Monday's high-technology tumble, proving once again that the only thing predictable about this market is its volatility.
To bullish analysts, yesterday's across-the-board rally -- which was sparked by strong earnings reports -- suggested that the worst of the market's recent troubles may be behind it. But others warned that coming economic figures from the government, including two on Thursday, could again spook investors. Most investors have learned not to read too much into any single day's performance in the stock market lately.

Meanwhile, bonds fell back as investors snapped up stocks.
The only other time the industrial average and the Nasdaq Composite each climbed by more than 200 points on the same day this year was a week ago Monday, when both were snapping back from the Frightful Friday plunges in both indexes. Indeed, only 10 times this year have both major indexes risen even 100-plus points on the same day, let alone 200.
With yesterday's gains, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is now barely in positive territory for the year, up 0.56% since Dec. 31. No other major stock index is back in the black. The Nasdaq Composite remains 8.8% lower for the year, and the industrial average 3.24%.
Some traders said the S&P 500's 47.58point, or 3.33%, rise to 1477.44 underscored the broad nature of the market's rally.
"People stepped up to buy, encouraged by positive earnings everywhere, from chemicals to technology," said Brian B. Conroy, head of listed trading at J.P. Morgan & Co., who noted that the market rallied during the last hour of trading on Monday and built on its gains yesterday. Indeed, while Nasdaq dropped 161.40 points Monday, it had been down nearly 300 points at one juncture amid jitters over Nasdaq stalwart Microsoft.
"Today is the kind of day that investors long for, there were haves and no havenots," said David Sowerby, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles.
Beaten-down Internet-related stocks were among the biggest winners on the day. Amazon.com rose $2.625, or 5.3%, to $52.4375, while Yahoo! jumped $10.625, or 9.3%, to $124.50. Overall, the 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index, which includes both stocks, rallied 9.7%, a day after it plunged 9.3%.
"Techs were oversold and a lot of money was on the sidelines and was put to work," said Bob Basel, co-head of listedequity trading at Salomon Smith Barney. Trading "volume was moderate, but there were plusses across the board."
Amid the sharp gains for stocks, bonds retreated, as few investors saw a need for super-safe Treasurys. The 10-year Treasury note fell 26/32, or $8.125 for a bond with $1,000 face value. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 6.121%. The 30-year bond fell 28/32, to yield 5.934%.
The Nasdaq's gains were its first in four sessions.
Helping the market gain ground yesterday: solid earnings from Xerox and Exxon Mobil. Meanwhile, bargain hunters scooped up shares of Microsoft, helping its shares rise $2.75, or 4.13% to $69.375 after Monday's 16% tumble. Microsoft is in both the industrial average and the Nasdaq Composite.

The market's impressive rebound suggested to one veteran analyst that stocks have bottomed out, after several weeks of weakness, and may now rally further.
"Some of the air has been taken out of the balloon, and like all corrections, this one wasn't a great deal of fun," said Laszlo Birinyi, global-trading strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities. "But it's not dissimilar from a year ago, when the market fell this time of year and then rose. We've bottomed out" and won't retest the market's recent lows.
To buttress his bullish stance, Mr. Birinyi cited data he has collected showing that more stocks traded on upticks, rather than downticks lately -- a bullish sign.
But some traders warned that tomorrow's much-anticipated release of figures on the first quarter's gross domestic product and the employment-cost index could worry investors by again raising the specter of higher inflation and interest rates. And some traders said that many tech investors are preparing to cash in profits, even as more value-oriented investors may look for bargains.
"Despite our conviction that the broad equity market is attractively valued, we think it makes sense to reduce our equity risk somewhat, mostly because we think the correction for technology stocks still has a ways further to go," argued Thomas McManus of Banc of America Securities, who on Monday recommended that investors hold 75% of their portfolios in stocks, down from 80%.
"People want to believe that [the worst is over], and that's why the rallies are so violent; the sellers just back away, and the appetite for stocks is voracious" Mr. Conroy of J.P. Morgan said. "But there's still a lot of concern about what the Fed will do, and people remain concerned about the tech sector, so we could still retest the recent lows."
Outside the U.S., stocks were flat. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 0.21 points, or 0.12%, to 179.35.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.059 billion shares traded, 2,137 stocks advanced and 863 declined.
The dollar was higher. The dollar hit its latest high against the sagging euro, which is now 22% below where it stood at its creation on Jan. 1, 1999. Late in New York, the dollar traded at 92.15 cents to the euro and 106.01 yen to the dollar, strengthening from 93.75 cents and 105.79 yen.
