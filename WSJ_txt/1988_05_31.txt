Stocks Surge 74.68 to Biggest Gain In Five Months on Heavy Volume
ABREAST OF THE MARKET
By David Wii.son
NEW YORK-The stock market broke out of the doldrums In a big way, staging Its sharpest rally in nearly five months.
Strong buying Interest and heavy dividend-related trading in selected Issues sent New York Stock Exchange volume to its highest level in more than four months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 74.68 to 2031.12, Its sharpest gain since Jan. 4, the first session of 1988, and Its sixth largest point gain ever.
Big Board volume exploded to 247.6 million shares, the highest single-session total since Jan. 25, when 275.3 million shares were traded. The three most active is-sues-Ohlo Edison, Public Service Enterprise Group and Continental Corp.-accounted for 98.4 million of the total. All those stocks are about to pay hefty dividends, making them prime targets for dividend plays by institutional investors.
The big surge came late in the day, and the advance in the Dow Jones industrials didn’t reach 50 points until the final hour. When it did, it triggered the Big Board’s restrictions on automated stock-index arbitrage trading. But traders said program trades continued to be made manually on the exchange floor and pushed the rally to its peak at the close.
Traders said the Jump was fueled by participants buying stocks to offset short, or oversold, positions and then by an out break of what one called “panic buying’’ as the market advanced.
Not even the largest one-day percentage gain in the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index in almost a decade could derail the market’s surge. The index, widely followed as an Inflation indicator, soared 5.50 points to a three-year high of 248.39. That 2.3% surge was its biggest In a single day since 1979, the CRB said.
The market's strength was reflected across the board. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index jumped 8.74 to 262.16, and the New York Stock Exchange composite Index surged 4.38 to 148.04. The Dow Jones Transportation Average added 21.65 to 826.31, and the Dow Jones Utilities Average soared 5.46 to 176.33. About 1,200 issues advanced in price on the Big Board, while 333 declined.
While traders and analysts attributed the market’s rally to a number of factors, two stood out; unmet expectations of an increase in the Federal Reserve’s discount rate and a reaction to tile recent extreme pessimism among investors.
Many traders were expecting Friday that tlie Fed would raise its discount rate, or fee on loans to banks, from the current 6% to counteract inflationary pressures. The central bank's failure to take any such action was viewed as a sign that the market's concerns about inflation and interest rates might be overdone.
Analysts and traders also pointed to several recent surveys of investor senti-

ment showing that the outlook for stock prices had become unusually downbeat.
"People had become so convinced that the news was going to be so negative tliat we almost had to go the other way,” said Monte Gordon, research director at Dreyfus Corp.
Although the Fed still might raise the discount rate after the U.S. report on May unemployment Friday, he said, the market Is drawing some encouragement from the central bank's show of restraint so far In its monetary policy..
"The Fed is moving In a measured stride. Its intent is not to disturb the equilibrium and create undue pressure for the economy," Mr. Gordon said. “That has given the market hope at this particular Juncture."
He said the absence of selling pressure during the market’s recent slide shows that investors are in no hurry to unload stocks, and that is forcing any prospective buyers to pay higher prices. “The market is giving us a sense that it has bottomed out, at least at this point," he said.
Edward P. Nicoski, a market analyst at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, Minneapolis, said lie is still cautious about the longer term. But he said he expects the current advance to continue and to move stocks close to the upper end of the trading range that has prevailed since last October's market crash. “This market is going to be as hard to buy as it is to sell," he said.
The market's overall strength led to solid advances for most blue-chip Issues. Merck climbed 2% to 53%, General Electric gained 2 to 42, Coca-Cola rose 2% to 38, Westinghouse Electric climbed 2% to 53'4,
F.W. Woolworth rose 1% to 51;!4, and Aluminum Co. of America gained 1% to close at 46.
Macmillan dropped 2*4 to 70 W after announcing a restructuring plan that it said would provide holders with more than the $64 a share that Robert M. Bass Group has offered for the company.
Centel jumped 4% to 50. Investor Asher B. Edelman and George L. Lindemann, chairman of Metro Mobile CTS, offered to acquire the company for $65 a share if Centel drops its planned acquisition of United Telecommunications' mobile telephone and paging operations. Otherwise, the investors said, they would offer only $60 a share.
