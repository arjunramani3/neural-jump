Industrials Spurt 19.54- Points in Biggest Advance
Since I^ate 1963; Bullish Washington News Cited’
Stock prices surged upward yesterday afternoon m a dramatic rise that boosted the Dow-Jones industrial average to its sharpest gam since late November 1963.
The explosive market action was Unexpected because yesterday was a semi-hobday with m»nv banks.^insurance companies and other businesses observing Columbus Day.
Brokers attributed the sharp gain mainly to official statements from Washington that the Vietnam conflict was unlikely to bring direct wage and pnee controls over the American economy.
Temping 19.54 points, or 2.58G, the industrial average closed at TVS 17. This was its greatest smgle-day advance since it shot up 32.03 points on Nov. 26, 1963. in a recovery move following the sharp drop on the day President Kennedy was assassinated.
The indicator started yesterday with a loss of more than two points but it then began gaining slowly and by noon had edged into the plus side. Picking up speed, the average rose steadily through the afternoon to the final bell.
“The tip-off that this rally was in the wind came in the morning when there was no real follow-through to the selling that developed late Tuesday,” said Newton D. Zinder. E F. Hutton & Co. analyst. The market had been up sharply earlier on Tuesdav and ended with a more modest gain. Its rise the first two days this week was attributed by brokers to a technical rebound after the indu-tnal average had slid about 80 points.
The adxance got a big push near 1 '30 p m . brokers said, from a statement by Commerce Secretary Connor that there are no indications “at this time” that the Vietnam war will require direct controls over the U S. economy; he added he has no doubt tliat President Johnson “would be quick” to impose them if needed. Later Arthur Okun. a member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, said there is "no earthly reason" for direct wage and price controls.
Also from Washington yesterday afternoon came news that Secretary of State Dean Rusk voiced hope that this week's discussions with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko here will result m agreements to demilitarize space and control the spread of nuclear weapons
"The White House was really turning on the good news," commented Eldon A Grimm, vice president of Walston & Co.
Short-Covering Is Notrd
A powerful force that helped fuel the rally once it got started, analysts said, was shortcovering. or the buying of shares to replace borrowed stock that had been su’d earlier Brokers report that shorting in rr< rn’ sessions has been at - fantastic" levels One brokerage house said short selling by its customers on Tuesday was even greater than on Monday, when it said the volume "was o-.t of this world " Another broker said, "The shorts were coming out of the woodwork "
The rush to cover short sales - to buy the shares before the stock prices rose sharply -was described by Mr. Grimm as a "bear panic ”
Another factor in the advance, brokers said, was a wire sent this week by a financial advisory service to its customers advising the purchase of some stocks The service based its recommendations on its studies of odd-lot transactions.
Also stimulating the rally, brokers asserted, was the leadership of American Telephone. The stock was the second most actively traded is-tie on turnover of 166,000 .Shares and jumped 3’_, to 55%

Market Views—
OPINION- Harris, Upham & Co sav s, "The area of the nud-700s in the Dow-Jones indus-tn.il average continues to represent a potential zone of favorable trend reversal of good proportion "... In the opinion of Kenneth Ward of Hayden. Stone & Co.: "Until the market indicates a willingness to stabilize and rebuild a necessary base, interim rallies probably will be limited. In other words, the market must prove itself: new purchases can t be recommended with too much confidence ”... William R White of Hornblower & Wccks-Hemphill. Noyes says: "In periods of indecision such as currently prevalent, individual stocks outperforming the market usually prove attractive for appreciation on any subsequent general advance. Such equities deserve consideration now.” . . . Dempsey-Tcgcler & Co comments. "The unique investment opportunities offered in this market phase are, in our opinion, quality vehicles in the bank, electricutility, fire-and-casualty-insurance. domesticoil and consumer-oriented growth groups.” . . . According to Bradbury K. Thurlow of Winslow. Cohu & Stetson. “It is only reasonable to assume that speculative psychology is going to remain in a badly shaken state for some time. This suggests that after climactic emotions die down, we may expect a fairly extended period of dullness.”
