Concern about worsening credit problems hammered financial stocks, sending the market into a late-day spiral and raising the specter of further declines.
Investor jitters were intensified when Standard & Poor's changed its outlook on Bear Stearns's long-term credit to negative from stable, citing risks from the Wall Street firm's exposure to mortgages and other credit instruments.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had roared above 14000 for the first time in July, ended an up-and-down week by sliding 281.42 points, or 2.1%, to 13181.91. The Dow Jones U.S. Financial Services Index shed 3.9% -- the worst performance of any of the 18 sectors tracked by Dow Jones Indexes.
For all the tumult, the Dow overall fell just 83.56 points on the week. But late-day moves have jarred investors; on Friday, the Dow dropped about 100 points in the last halfhour of trading.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, with a heavy component of financial stocks, tumbled 2.7% Friday, or 39.14 points, to 1433.06. The S&P 500 is down 7.7% from its record set last month, which means it has covered most of the ground to a 10% pullback traditionally defined as a correction that shakes speculative excess out of a bull market.
Whether the market actually reaches that threshold may depend on the financial sector, analysts say. Banks and other financial firms became increasingly important bellwethers for the broader market during the recent boom, fueled in large part by corporate dealmaking, which sent several market measures to records.
The financial sector is now bearing the brunt of investors' jitters over the economy and the shakeout in risky mortgages, which could spill over into other corners of the credit markets.
"Even our nonfinancial stocks are getting hit by guilt by association with the financials," said Craig Hester, chief executive of asset-management firm Hester Capital Management, referring to losses in his firm's portfolio Friday.
"Fear has totally taken over today," he added. "I think this could turn into a full 10% market correction, although I don't see things getting much worse than that."
The Dow's 0.6% drop for the week marked its third consecutive weekly drop, while the S&P 500 lost 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2%.
The Nasdaq fell 2.5% on Friday, or 64.73 points, to 2511.25.
As investors fled stocks, they pushed up prices on Treasury securities, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to 4.698%.
The stock-market session got off to a shaky start when the Labor Department released data showing weaker U.S. job growth in July than analysts expected, and a surprising rise in the unemployment rate to 4.6% from June's reading of 4.5%. This sparked concerns that consumer spending could weaken and borrowers could have a harder time paying off debt.
Investors will now turn their attention to Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. Despite the market turmoil, the committee is expected to leave its interest-rate target at 5.25%, where it has been for more than a year. But it is likely to reinforce, in its written statement to be released after the meeting, that its principal concern is that inflation might rise.
Some market watchers expect the Fed to couple its focus on inflation risk with an acknowledgement of risks to growth. Others anticipate, in the Fed's description of the economy, some reference to tighter financial conditions.
If the statement is little changed, it would signify a widening gulf in perceptions between the Fed and more pessimistic market participants.
"I am finding this Fed attitude of 'What, me worry?' to be a bit tiresome," said Jim Capra, head of Capra Asset Management, a money- management firm. "We may be in the
midst of a true-blue financial crisis. . . . What is the Fed's Plan B if the contamination spreads to retail sales and employment? Are they going to crucify the system on a
cross . . . of rational expectations?"
