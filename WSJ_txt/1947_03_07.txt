Stocks broke sharply yesterday. As measured by the industrial average, which closed at 1 <‘7.05, off 4.S3, it was the sharpest-drop in a single day since November 6, 1946. The decline erased the consecutive advances of the preceding five days. The closing price for the industrials was the lowest .since January 25. Trading was whipped up on the decline, with the tape running behind as much az 2 minutes, and the 1.210.000 shares changing hands was the largest since February 26. Trading was broad, with 1,063 different issues appearing on the tape, ot which 912 declined and 70 advanced. There were 87 new lows for 1947. prominent among which was American Telephone & Telegraph.
■ uroKers reported inert was comparatively j little selling by the rank and file of the public. Much of it came from New York sellers, inI eluding short term traders and Street so* called professionals. Reasons ascribed for , the rapid fire break was that the market showed technical weakness whan it failed to respond to the decision in the Lewis case. Much emphasis was placed on the Agriculture Department statement that forces now at Work seem to indicate a business recession late in 1947 j But it took the afternoon dispatch from ^Washington reporting that the President had called off his Caribbean trip, ' presumably because of the Grecian crisis, to really start the selling. This took stocks : down from 2 to more than 5 points and lead, ers closed around the lows Both railroads land utilities were included in the heavy sell-1 mg but were not as active as the idustrial I division.

Heard on the Street—
. Emphasizing the importance to business .of trends in population, the March issue of i “Business Comment” of the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago, observes that population in the United States is now growing faster I than in the 1930s However, the review as-laerts that a substantially older average popu-ilation will emerge in the next several decades. 'The reason for this more rapid rise of population. according to the article, is the higher birth rate. Since 1941. births have averaged 'about three million a year, and in 1946 close to 3 3 million, compared with 25 million ‘prior to the war. The death rate is now 'at less than half the birth rate. •	•	•
One leading broker-commentator said: ’’The bears have some perfectly valid long term arguments which they are timing badly: or they mav be too far ‘sold by the snowballing of their own partly faulty reasoning. Time will tell. In the meantime, the market shows more of an inclination to do better than to do worse.” • • • Some brokers like the activity and strength in a number of lower priced stocks, as indicating that Investors are getting more active m the more 'speculative issues They say this suggests a “rise m speculative temperature” which is a necessary link in the chain of better market conditions, -including volume. ’	’ *
'Some substantial buying of packing house J shares has been taking place. As a matter 'of fact, a long period of investment accumulation has been going on in such issues as -Cudahy.

Market Views—
Tybor Stores. Inc. traded in over-the-counter. has been reviewed by Chas. A. Day
*	Co. Inc., of Boston. • • • Laidlaw <fc Co’, discussing Boeing Airplane, said: ”The stock has been giving a better than average market performance in the airframe group. In
, our opinion, this reflects the growing realiza-1 tion of the strong position of the company 1 technologically, financially, and with reference to its commercial order backlog.” • • • Charles Clark & Co., in an analysis of Sterchi Bros. Stores. Inc., concluded: •’Because the .market is ignoring present earnings, it may be a safe assumption that it will continue to for an indefinite period, at least until investors are convinced that the earning power will be sustained. To the patient investor who will be content for the long pull, we suggest this stock for indicated high yield and excellent long-term appreciation possibilities.” • * • H.

Glen AJden Coal Co.-
Glen Alden Coal Co. last year had its largest net income since 1942. it earned $4.898,668 net. which was equal to 52,82 a share on the 1.735,000 shares of capital stock outstanding. In the previous year the company, which is the largest producer of Pennsylvania anthracite, reported a net income of $3,178,453. or $1.83 a share. Dividends in each year totaled $2 a share. The improvement in earnings last year reflected ‘'more realistic pricing” of the product by the OP.A., but the major part of the gain came as a result of a million-ton increase in the company's annual production. Last year Glen AJden itself mined 7.923,253 tons 01 anthracite and tenants mined 1.202.246 tons, or a total of 9,125,499 tons from lands owned and controlled.
The annua, report refers to a substantial increase in the productive force but adds that its daily output is still much below the prewar level. Under the new labor contract last year operating • costs rose sharply, resulting in higher prices. The company sounds a warning that if anthracite is to maintain its position tn the fuel industry there must be wholehearted cooperation between labor and management Comparing operations last year with 1942 Glen Alden’s dollar revenue rose by almost 29% but operating income was lower. The fact that net Income was prac-I tically the same in both years was largely because of the much smaller interest charges as a result of the refinancing and reduction of long-term debt in 1944.

extension work has been effected. The company has under way a program designed to( augment its transmission facilities and to addj 33.000 kilowatts of new steam generating equipment in two years. In addition, it is placing orders for a 12.000 kilowatt water-1 wheel-driven generator which will be installed t in its Thompson hydroelectric plant located1 near Duluth. This hydro increase also is scheduled for completion in 1949. Expenditures made during the current year on both these projects and on the other items of its construction program are expected to be met out of cash on hand and through cash to be raised from operations
Kansa* City Power A Light—
Harry B. Munsell. newly elected president of Kansas City Power &. Light Co. is considered one of the top financial men in utility refunding and financing. He handled all financing matters and the Integration plans of the United Light system since 1939 Mr. Munsell was responsible for the recent 548 million refunding of bonds and stocks. The dozen or so refundings of United’s subsidiaries were the work of Munsell. who joined the company in 1929 as a member of the legal staff. Kansas City Power Sc Light had its best year in 1946. with earnings reported to have been 57 40 a common share compared with 55 51 ir. 1945. The gain in net income largely reflected the reduction in income taxes, because there was no appreciable change in gross revenues from the previous year.
TWA—
The Transcontinental * Western Air stockholders proxy statement for the meeting of April 24 probably will give a strong hint as to who will head the company If Tsui Riuhtcr. operations vice president now vacationing in Florida, is on the list, it will be a good guess he will become president. Other possibilities mentioned in airline circles are Warren Lee Pierson, of American Cable & Radio, and LaMotte Cohu of Northrop Aircraft. Mr Cohu has said he has no desire to leave Northrop, of which he is chairman, but talk persists.
T.W A. needs more flying equipment, and although it probably will not be able to take delivery of any of the 18 new model *'619” new type Lockheed Constellations now on order unless financing is ai ranged. the airline mav be able to purchase four of the older modei ”49” from Lockheed. These four, if the deal works out. would .come from the gtoup of eight which T.W.A. canceled last fall when financial difficulties became acute. Orders for 17 Douglas DC-4s were canceled at the same time.

American ice Co. - ■
Net profit of the American Ire Co. last year was less than m 1945. but the amount available for the common stock was the largest since 3932. The reason for the increased earnings for the junior security is the sharp reduction in the outstanding preferred stock over the past few years Last year 25.221 shares of non-cumulative non-redeemable preferred were acquired for retirement and the 5.50S shares of cumulative redeemable preferred were retired on November 1 At the close of the year there were only 17,748 shares of the non-redeemable preferred outstanding ahead of the common stock. There are no bank loans or funded debt.
After a reserve of $120,000 for contingencies. the 1946 net profit was $707,387, which was equal, after the deduction of $137,153 preferred dividends, to $1 02 a share on the 559.197 shares of common stock, tn the preceding year net profit amounted to $887,211 The deduction of $338.8X3 preferred dividends left earnings on the common equal to 98 cents a share. The accumulated reserve for contingencies now amounts to $595,000. Trial of the suit brought in Chancery Court of New Jersey by certain preferred stockholders, claiming dividend arrears, is expected to be completed before the court recesses for the summer. The action followed the declaration in September, 1916. of a divdend of 50 cents on the common stock, which was paid January 2 this year—the first on the common since 1932 During 1946 the company, at cost of $900,000, acquired two additional ice plants in the New York City area and increased its production facilities in the Washington, D. C , area.

Hart Schaffner 4: Marx-
Hart Schaffner Sc. Marx, manufacturer and retailer of men’s suits, probably will not raise its dividend, now set at the annual rate of $2.40 a common share, despite the fact that earnings last year more than doubled in reaching $9.44 a common share. Meyer Kestnbaum. president, stated the directors consider it wise to continue a conservative policy with respect to dividends in view of the company’s additional capital requirements. Current assets for the year ended November 30, 1946, were $19.9 million while current 'labilities were $6.4 million. But Mr. Kestnbaum asserted it is likely more capital will be needed tor higher inventories and additional investment in store properties. Two retail subsidiaries will undertake to build new structures in Chicago and Los Angeles. Other properties should be modernized, he added.
While Hart Schaffner Sc Marx has not beer able to produce enough suits to meet customer demand for a number ot years, this condition may change shortly as the acute shortage of consumers goods is coming to an end, Mr Kestnbaum asserted. “The problem of maintaining acceptable price levels under the impact of rising **osts is becoming increasingly serious and we may expect operating margins to decline,’* he declared recently in a letter to stockholders.
