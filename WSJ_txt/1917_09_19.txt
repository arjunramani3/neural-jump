readjustment of commitments-------------Strength
most pronounced in coppers, equipments and special Issues- - Shorts 'driven to ©over Rafis gain.
Sales, 837,200 shares.
The expected did happen and the trading assumed a more cheerful tone. Stocks became active and strong notwithstanding news that might have been exploited for the benefit of the bears. Even the rails were firmer. The leadership as in the previous day was taken by the coppers and steels. The advance, however, was more uniform. Some of the stocks like General Motors that had been under pressure with apparently no hope for a turn suddenly showed signs of strength. The better Mexican outlook was reflected in the Mexican group. The easier money condition with call money renewing at 4^7 was a helpful factor. The drive at the shorts was impetuous and successful. Fractional recessions here and there did not change the upward trend.
War conditions are still governing. The belief of nearness of peace is for the time being in the background. Two’to three years of war ahead are looked for. Under such conditions the market after the drive at the shorts should settle down to a discrimination between investmen securities having a fixed return and war shares which notwithstanding the high taxes will continue to show good All enterprises that will profiit from a continuance of the war will be well bought. Adjustment is likely in the railroad shares and preferred stocks as well as in other standard stocks with fixed returns. While a higher price level is expected in certain industrial quarters, expectations of an old-fashioned bull mnrket are cut down. Further distribution rather is likely at the peaks.
It comes down to the question of ho vs long Germany will hold out. Th° leader of the Cler.ca’ Party in Germany is credited with adnrlt.ng a daily loss of 1.12^0 men in killed, equal to 450.000 men annually, and i.« u<’nc thir. argument for an earlj peace

IH»y in AanoancemcMi of Price® oc Copper and Steel
There was some	******** on the announcement
by Secretary Tumulty that he did not expect the President io make a decision on steel or copper prices today. The belief persisted, however* that copper prices have practically been arranged, but that it might be necessary to enact new legislation before the steel situation could be handled.
Firmness in All Quarters
The tone was consistently firm during the second hour, equipment shares holding all their gains and in some cases tinning the move forward.
Shipping shares were strong.
General Motors developed a sudden demand and sold to 91, up 3%. Central leather increased its gain to an equal figure and even the rails were responsive to the generally better feeling.
.	Better Sentiment
Houses which had been heavy seller® during the past w*M»k or v»n days turned to the buying side and accumulated large lines, believed on the floor to be for account of some of the larger and more spectacular bear operators. General Motors and United State* Steel were particularly bought in this way.
Surplusage of Hides Alleged
Central Leather’s strength was m the face of pessimistic reports from the west of the possible use of wooden ‘shoes in this country. while the fart seems- to bo that the increased slaughter of beef an.ni.il> dur.ng the war period and the .-hutting ofT of the European market has enabled the leather companies to acquire millions of hide* so that instead of a shortage there i* a surp'u^age of leatner. The-e hideb. it argued, arr being held for the dawn of peace when tlie European muskets wdl t»c reopened with a tremendous demand In the wholesale shoe trade these, reports of the hoarding of huh", are taken with several grains of salt.
