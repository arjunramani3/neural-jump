Abreast of the Market
Industrials Dive 28.67 in the Sharpest Sethack Since 1962; Retail Gasoline Sales Curb Feared
By Victor J.
Mounting cuniern over the embargo ot Arabian oil sent the stock market into a nosedive yesterday The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.67 points, its sharpest setback in more than 11 years. But trading was only moderately active.
Investors' already-gloomy outlook took on a darker cast yesterday when President Nixon’s Emergency Action Group proposed a ban on Sunday retail sales of gasoline
The industrial average closed at 862 66 following its biggest loss since it dropped 34 95 points on May 28, 1962. when President Kennedy had a confrontation with the steel industry In the past three weeks the indi< ator has plummeted a total of 124.40 points.
After this steep slide, the market is "egregiously oversold." in the view of Robert M Seward, partner in charge of trading at Smith Barney & Co But. he added, “in the absence of something definitive on the Middle East oil” scene next year’s economic picture remains clouded
Robert Stovall, vice president of Reynolds Securities Inc., noted "disappointment that Secretary Kissinger wasn't able to effect a rapprochement (over the oil embargo) with the Arabs." The disappointment was especially acute, he said, after the optimistic statements Friday by President Nixon and Vice President-designate Ford that raised investors' hopes that Arabian oil would be turned on again. Over the weekend, Arab oil ministers asserted they aren’t about to restore the full flow of oil, but they did decide to spare Europe a further cut. Mr. Stovall observed, too, that fears about the impact of the energy crisis on the economy had turned the stock price retreat into an “hysterical market.”
Sharp losses also were posted by the transportation and utility averages, although their percentage setbacks weren’t as great as that of the industrial average.
New York Stock Exchange losers smothered gainers better than seven to one; at the close, 1,404 issues were down and only 198 up. New 1973 lows surged to 192 from 93 on Friday and new highs fell to two from 10. Institutional Activity Eased
Despite the trade of some unusually large blocks. Big Board volume fell to 16,700,000 shares from 22,510,000 the prior session. The slowing of institutional activity was apparent from the drop in the trades of 10,000 shares or more to 96 from 141 Friday.
Mr. Seward of Smith Barney said “institutions generally haven't been aggressive sellers although they’ve definitely pulled back on their buying programs.”
On the economic front there was news that corporate profits halted their long climb in the third quarter with a $71.5 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate, down $100 million from the second period; the inflation rate for the quarter was revised to 7% annually from 6.7%.
Declines overwhelmed gainers on the American Stock Exchange about five-to-one and its index slid 2.36 to 98.28. Activity slackened a bit to 3,140,000 shares from 3,420,000 the previous session. Over-the-counter stock prices also lost ground; the National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ composite index dropped 2.38 to 99.00.
Bond prices didn’t join the retreat. Prime corporates climbed about % point in over-the-counter trading and long-term governments rose about 8-32 point.
Oil, chemical, computer and auto stocks were particularly hard hit on the Big Board. They were joined by defense, airline, housing, retail, drug, electronic, machinery, movie, paper, publishing, rubber, savings-and-loan and steel issues. But golds, countering the downtrend, gained.
Among auto stocks, depressed by fears of a gasoline shortage, General Motors, fell 2% to 55 as sixth most active issue. Chrysler slipped 1% to 19 and Ford, 2% to 43%.
In the oil sector, Exxon dropped 3% to 92%, in active trading. Standard Oil of California slipped 3% to 61%. Texaco declined %
