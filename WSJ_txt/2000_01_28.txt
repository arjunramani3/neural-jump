"People are trying to rotate out of where there already are huge profits, but every time they take a step it works for a couple of days, and then they get punished, because there is a lot of confusion about where to rotate to," says Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at mutual-fund group Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. "The stuff that ran up so sensationally has been the target."
Fears about high prices explain a lot of it. "At certain points people are going to focus a bit on valuations," says Keith Sabol, manager of the Aggressive Growth Fund at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh, which specializes in small companies with fast-growing revenues. "After huge runs, some of those stocks are going to offer a less-attractive risk-reward tradeoff."
Yahoo! (Nasdaq) fell 23 7/8, or 7%, to 313 1/2. USInternetworking (Nasdaq) declined 3 13/16 to 45 5/8. Conexant Systems (Nasdaq) fell 1 1/16 to 86 1/2. Juniper Networks (Nasdaq) slipped 1 11/16 to 140 3/4. Broadcom (Nasdaq), another momentum-driven favorite, gained 2 5/8 to 284.

A nasty day Friday reminded investors of a painful reality: Today's stock market quietly has acquired the attention-span of a two-year-old.
Whether Friday's bout of inflation fears marks the start of a prolonged decline, or markets instead briskly right themselves after Federal Reserve policy makers finish their two days of meetings Wednesday, investors should probably get used to stomach-churning turbulence.
It wasn't long ago that investors counted on big stocks, especially big technology stocks such as Microsoft and Dell Computer, to lead the market . Suddenly even those titans are being yanked up and down as investors rotate furiously from one group of leaders to the next.
"People are trying to rotate out of where there already are huge profits, but every time they take a step it works for a couple of days, and then they get punished, because there is a lot of confusion about where to rotate to," says Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at mutual-fund group Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. "The stuff that ran up so sensationally has been the target."
Signs of serious volatility started cropping up last year, as blue chips gave up leadership to Internet stocks, and then the old Internet stocks surrendered to upstart Internet retailers such as eBay. Following was a succession of new darlings that captured investors' imaginations, including semiconductor stocks, software stocks , business-oriented Internet stocks and fiber-optics stocks such as JDS Uniphase. Late in 1999, investors shifted again, this time to genetic-science stocks such as Celera Genomics and Enzo Biochem. By the start of this year, even those darlings were being abandoned. Some day traders began pulling money out of technology and putting it into stocks they once wouldn't go near, such as beaten-down drug or financial issues, says Russell Grigsby, chairman of Cornerstone Securities, a day-trading firm in Austin, Texas.
L. Keith Mullins, who follows small, fast-growing stocks for Salomon Smith Barney, says, "People are suspicious about whether the trends that have been pushing the market ahead can sustain themselves for long. For the past year and a half, there has been a consistent rotation among the sectors by the aggressivemoney crowd."
The volatility got especially bad Friday amid worries about whether big winners can survive a sustained round of Fed interest-rate increases.
Stocks crumbled after government data showed inflation, labor costs and economic growth all higher than expected for the fourth quarter. Inflation fears sent the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is dominated by the tech names, into its second-heaviest point-loss ever, although not one of its worst percentage losses. (The worst point drop ever came earlier this month.) It fell 152.49 points, or 3.77%, to 3887.07. The week's 348.34-point drop was its worst weekly decline ever and at 8.22% the fifth-heaviest weekly percentage drop.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped to its lowest level since Nov. 11. Its drop of 289.15, or 2.62%, to 10738.87 marked its seventh heaviest point-loss ever although not among the worst in percentage terms. The weekly tumble was the third-worst ever, 512.84 points. The weekly percentage fall, 4.56%, wasn't among the worst; the index recorded a similar decline as recently as October.
Another sign of how jumpy technology investors are: The Dow Jones Internet Index again is in what Wall Street often calls a correction, down more than 10% from its Jan. 3 record. The Dow industrials and the Nasdaq are more than 8% off their highs, close to a correction.
Perhaps more significant than Friday's steep drop in the Nasdaq composite is just how common such moves, up and down, are becoming. January is often volatile, particularly for technology issues, but this January has set standards for how much bone shaking investors must endure.
It used to be rare for the Nasdaq composite to move 2% in a single day. From its 1971 inception until 1998, it never did it more than twice in any January, according to research by Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn.
In January 1998, it had three such 2% daily moves, two up and one down. In 1999, volatility increased as January saw seven 2% moves, five up and two down. This year, it moved to a new level, lurching 2% on 10 days, four up and six down.

Fears about high prices explain a lot of it. "At certain points people are going to focus a bit on valuations," says Keith Sabol, manager of the Aggressive Growth Fund at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh, which specializes in small companies with fast-growing revenues. "After huge runs, some of those stocks are going to offer a less-attractive risk-reward tradeoff."
On top of that, trading is easy and relatively cheap. Short-term trading has taken on an allure and lost some of its past stigma. The flood of new-stock offerings has helped make investors who chase hot stocks even more itchy-fingered than usual. That helps explain stocks' huge, speedy gains, and equally huge, and sudden, declines.
A surprising number of blue-chip technology names have fallen victim to the market 's fickleness. Although the overall tech sector, even with the recent pullback, is up more than 36% in the past three months, some of its biggest and best-known constituents have declined. Among them are Dell, America Online, Gateway, Tellabs and Lucent Technologies. Microsoft is up just 9%, and is 18% below its 52-week high.
Even hot new-tech stocks, such as JDS Uniphase and Commerce One, have taken hits. JDS is 18% below its high, and Commerce One is 32% off its high.
Does all this volatility portend a more serious drop? Not necessarily.
In 1999 the average stock suffered from the market's lack of staying power but the tech sector certainly didn't. After a rocky summer, it roared back in the fall. That can happen again.
All the volatility probably means stockpicking will be risky business. Although the optimists insist the broad market will recover after it digests its declines, others worry more painful declines than investors expect are in store.
"I think that at some point the markets become overwhelmed through a concern about either an internal event, such as interest rates, valuations and earnings, or an external event," says Mr. Mullins of Salomon Smith Barney. "You come to a point when the capital markets need to catch their breath."
After that? "You have half a dozen true sector leaders [within technology] who survive and come back and do quite well," Mr. Mullins says. "But the vast majority of the also-rans never come back."
Friday's Market Activity
Stocks sensitive to shifts in the interest-rate backdrop suffered sharp losses. J.P. Morgan dropped 7 9/16 to 118 1/16, while Chase Manhattan fell 4 to 76 11/16, and Citigroup shed 2 13/16 to 56 1/8.
General Electric sank 7 to 134 3/4, while General Motors declined 3 15/16 to 78 15/16, and Wal-Mart Stores fell 4 13/16 to 54 9/16.
Qualcomm (Nasdaq), among 1999's biggest winners, has suffered a setback of 44% from its Jan. 3 high, including a decline of 9 7/16 to 110 9/16.
Yahoo! (Nasdaq) fell 23 7/8, or 7%, to 313 1/2. USInternetworking (Nasdaq) declined 3 13/16 to 45 5/8. Conexant Systems (Nasdaq) fell 1 1/16 to 86 1/2. Juniper Networks (Nasdaq) slipped 1 11/16 to 140 3/4. Broadcom (Nasdaq), another momentum-driven favorite, gained 2 5/8 to 284.
The drug sector was the lone group that rallied. It benefited from relief following President Clinton's failure to propose drug-price controls in his State of the Union address. Merck added 1 7/8 to 76 1/4. Johnson & Johnson gained 4 to 84 1/2. Bristol-Myers Squibb advanced 2 to 64 1/4. Eli Lilly rose 1 1/16 to 65 5/16.
Coca-Cola declined again, falling 2 11/16 to 56 15/16 and continuing the decline prompted by concerns earlier this week about the company's growth goals.
Bausch & Lomb continued higher, gaining 2 to 62 1/2, after rising 7% Thursday. The company had reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
Comverse Technology (Nasdaq) gained 3 13/16 to 140 5/16 after pulling back 6% Thursday. Lehman Brothers, citing the decline, reiterated its buy rating on the Woodbury, N.Y., maker of wireless-telecommunications messaging products.
Varian Semiconductor (Nasdaq) gained 7 3/4 to 50 3/4. Credit Suisse First Boston raised its earnings projections for this year and next, after the Gloucester, Mass., chipmaking equipment supplier reported fiscal first-quarter profits that beat Wall Street expectations.
Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson (Nasdaq) rose 4 7/16 to 70 1/16 after the Swedish telecommunications concern reported fourth-quarter earnings and offered a bullish outlook.
Veritas Software (Nasdaq) fell 3 3/4 to 154 although the Mountain View, Calif., Internet-storage software developer came through with stronger-than-expected fourthquarter results. Credit Suisse First Boston reiterated its buy rating.
Intertrust Technologies (Nasdaq) sank 12 1/16 to 160 15/16, while BSquare (Nasdaq) declined 4 1/8 to 41 7/8, although both companies reported better-than-expected results.
Western Wireless (Nasdaq), which fell 20% Thursday on a pessimistic call by PaineWebber, fell 2 3/4 to 52 3/8, although Lehman Brothers said the fears of a revenue slowdown have been overdone.
Some market watchers disputed any suggestion that fears of higher rates triggered Friday's sell-off. "I don't think this data catches the Fed by surprise," said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies.
