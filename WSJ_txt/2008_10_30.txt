With one trading day left in October, the month is shaping up to be among the worst and most volatile in stock-market history.
The market rose Thursday despite government data that showed the economy had shrunk for the first time in seven years, but it remains down 15.4% for the month, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That would make October the 11th-worst month in history and the worst in 21 years.
The credit crisis and worsening economy has led to wild price swings during the month. The average daily range from low to high has been 605.51 points. The index hasn't had two consecutive daily gains all month, and it has had 16 down days, the most since August 1973, during a grinding bear market.
The market had a relatively benign day Thursday, with the Dow industrials rising 189.73 points, or 2.1%, to close at 9180.69. A rally that began in Asia and continued in Europe pulled the market higher as officials around the world took further steps to stabilize the ailing global financial system.
Except for a span lasting a few minutes around midday, the Dow industrials spent the entire session in the black, the gains accelerating as the closing bell neared.
"When the market stabilizes in the face of negative news, that's an encouraging sign" that it may have reached a low, said Ned Riley, chief executive of Riley Asset Management. "We've scared people so much with talk of recessions and depressions, I guess it's sunk in," leaving fewer sellers on the sidelines to be spooked when confirmation of economic weakness materializes.
But the market could remain volatile in the near term, including during Friday's session, which will include month-end rebalancing by hedge funds and other participants following one of the most turbulent periods in market history.
"We're still seeing signs of a market driven by traders with a three- or five-minute mentality," Mr. Riley said.
The S&P 500-stock index was up 24 points, or 2.6%, to 954.09. All of its sectors finished higher, led by a 5.8% gain in utilities. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite Index was up 41.31, or 2.5%, to 1698.52. The small-stock Russell 2000 rose 23.30, or 4.8%, to 514.18.
The Commerce Department said third-quarter gross domestic product declined at a seasonally adjusted 0.3% annual rate. The report represented the weakest GDP reading in seven years, but analysts had been expecting an even bigger drop.
