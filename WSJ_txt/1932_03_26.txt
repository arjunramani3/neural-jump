The stock market worked sharply lower or. Saturday. Many of the leading- issues broke through previous resistance levels. This uncovered outside stop loss orders and public liquidation through commission houses was larger than in several weeks. Traders covered shorts actively as lower prices were established, but this demand was not sufficient to absorb the increased offerings. The outstanding topic was the defeat of the sales tax in the House at Washington, which created uncertainties in the minds of professionals and others regarding the manner in which efforts will be made to balance the Federal budget. A small amount of outside scale buying was reported in the first half hour.
Conservative observers contended that buying should be further postponed until another trading range has been established They advised customers who had long positions to use nearby stops for protection and favored the reduction of holdings during any technical rally m the current week.
ConimlHslon House*
Sold on Balance
Commission houses had more business than in several weeks There was a little outside buying during the setback at the start, but as prices cased further stop orders were uncovered. and public liquidation increased considerably. As a result, the leading firms were sellers on balance. Many of the traders who had planned an Easter holiday came to the Street because of the House action on the sales tax. They were early sellers, aiding in putting most stocks to levels where the stops were reached. However, they took advantage of the outside liquidation to cover part of their short obligations, and were buyers on balance as a result.
Publir Interest
Negligible
PubhL interest m recent sessions has been smaller than m some time Commission houses have noted a tendency among clients to refrain from adopting the long side, although many of them have impressive credit balances. Most of the outside dealings have been on the selling side as longs have been reducing speculative commitments during the minor rallies which followed attempts by the pessimists to estaolisn lower levels.
Governniont Bonds

Brokers’ Loans
Down 6.77 "7,
Brokers loans last week decreased $37,000,000. or 6 77';, while loans direct to non-broker customers were down $25,000,000. the latter dipping to a new low record of $1,610,000,000. This development was viewed aw reflecting liquidation by outsiders during the period when the Dow-Jones' industrial average lost 1.67 points A feature of the statement was the reduction of $32,000,000 in borrowings ficrm local member banks to reach the new lev. reeoid total of $399,000,000. Loans from out-of-town banks were $5,000,000 lower.
Sales Tux Test
Disappointing
Defeat in the House of the sales tax on a test vote was a disappointment to many in the financial district. While it is difficult to predict what form the new tax bill finally will take, if an attempt is made to balance the budget by higher surtaxes it is certain that large funds will be driven from stocks and investment bonds into the tax exempt municipal and state issues. Some bond houses already have reported indications of such a switch in progress
I*. S. Steel Common Ln
Narrow lUn^e—(X)
V. S Steel common has moved within a comparatively narrow range in many of the recent sessions. While the stock has met support on reactions, the fact that moderate advances encounter increased offerings has not been hignly encouraging. Many operators have been unwilling to purchase Steel common because <rf the knowledge that first quarter earnings must be decidedly unsatisfactory. Belief is widespread that the common dividend will be omitted, and pessimists contend that these developments
