& trader looking for quick profits, but over a broad period Investors who pick their way carefully have been rewarded by purchasing stocks that were under-appraising their true worth.

News from abroad Thursday was regarded as distinctly threatening, the reports that Italy might occupy Albania producing a new wave of nervousness. Fears that major trouble might break out during the Easter holidays increased the desire for liquidity and the market was on the defensive from the opening dealings.
1 nc market had to depend lor support upon bargain hunters and short covering. Since there had been a steady stream of bargain hunting orders during the first half of the week, much ot this demand was exhausted around existing levels and further offerings had to go at deeper concessions.
■Wall Street traders were somewhat unnerved by the persistent decline and by the failure of a rally to put in an appearance. Some of the aircraft stocks, farm equipments and utilities continued to encounter support just above last week’s lows, but the list of stocks that broke previous support points elsewhere in the market increased substantially. Blue chip industrials were again hard hit. The highly volatile Allied Chemical dropped 8 points. du Font, Union Carbide and Westinghouse Electric lost 4 points. Steels, motors, rubbers and coppers were just as hard hit measured by percentage decline. Many rails broke previous 1939 low points.
Volume of dealings was not as large as In other weak sessions recently, being 1,300.000 shares, but the activity was always during periods ot market weakness. Much of the industrial news that appeared during the day was of a type that ordinarily would receive favorable market attention, but it was disregarded ’under the urge to turn equities into cash over the holiday period.
Bond prices were generally lower, some of the speculative sections weakening badly. Commodities were little changed.
particularly large as yet. Domestically, the copper situation remains quiet and producers are resigned to hand to mouth buying for some months to come and careful shopping on the part of consume*^ on pnesa. It appears more probable that the lower prices for copper nowprevailing will be generally established. While fabricators’ stocks of the 'metal are quite low. they are in a position to demand concessions in price.
UTILITIES IN WAR—
Utility company profits in the World War period varied considerably as between companies. Higher coal costs affected some systems that were dependent upon this fuel. Based upon their experience through that conflict, Goodbody & Co. makes the following conclusions in regard to utilities in the event of another war.
1.	Enactment of war profits taxes w’ould tend to put a ceiling on earnings. Utilities would then sell on a yield basis. Non-dividend common stocks of utility holding companies might suffer.
2.	Companies wholly dependent on coal for fuel might also suffer (manufactured gas companies. also Consolidated Edison of N. Y., Detroit Edison. Boston Edison, etc.).
3.	Companies not serving highly industrialized regions might be adversely affected (Engineers Public Service, Pacific Gas &. Electric, etc ).
4.	However, companies like Consolidated Gas of Baltimore and United Gas Improvement might benefit because of having access to hydro-electric power and industrial by-product gas. plus the advantage of serving a seaboard metropolitan area.
5.	The natural gas companies might be expected to benefit most, such as Columbia Gas & Electric. American Light & Traction, Peoples Gas Light & Coke. Except for such special issues as these, utility stocks would not be favored to hold through a war period by those interested primarily in maximum appreciation.

Bt'SINESS INDF-X VP—
i As a market factor, trade news temporarily Is being disregarded, but the fact hardly can be disregarded that there is no evidence of a collapse in domestic trade. Latest figures, in fact, covering diversified activities, give a contrary effect. The Barron's business index for the week ended April 1 has moved up to 73 4 from 72 5 This index, moreover, does not bulge easily since it is adjusted lor long term trend and population growth.
Official automobile sales figures are bearing out recent reports that the slump in car buying noted m mid-March was followed by a pickup in the 10 days ended April 1. Seventeen chain stores showed a gain ol 8.28% over the like month a year ago. the largest gam since July. 1937. The month's sales were aided by an early Easter but this was oifset in large measure by bad weather. Railroad carloadings lor the week
