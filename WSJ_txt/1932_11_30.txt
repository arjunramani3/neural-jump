With volume approximately twice as large as on Tuesday, industrial stock prices yesterday penetrated the previous resistance point in the Dow-Jones averages reached on November 3, but railroad stocks stayed more than a point above the low of October 10. The market opened quietly and with considerable irregularity as a result of some short covering based on the rally in sterling, which had rebounded sharply in London from an oversold position. The market’s sluggish response to early buying and the continued pressure in United States Steel preferred, American Tobacco B and a few other issues induced professionals to make short commitments in other sections of the list.
The industrials gave ground easily under the early selling. Around midday a burst of selling in the rails developed coincident with the announcement on the Dow-Jones news ticker that the Chicago. Burlington & Quincy directors had decided to postpone consideration of the common dividend until later in the year Atchison, Union Pacific, New York Central and other leaders m this group sold off from 1 to 3\. points from the previous night’s close.
Activity picked up materially on this dip American Telephone. Allied Chemical and other pivotal industrials were compelled to absorb considerable selling from traders who placed a bearish interpretation upon the market’s technical performance. Woolworth and Safeway Stores were notable features of weakness in the chain store group. Though the volume of trading diminished late in the day, the list remained heavy near its lows at the close, with American Tobacco and Steel preferred meeting continual pressure of offerings.
Commodity markets showed somewhat better resistance to selling. December corn showed a loss of 1% cents a bushel, but wheat was off only cent and cotton showed a negligible change at the close after fluctuating in a range of about 12 points. The commodity markets showed relief from the daily succession of new lows in sterling. Like shares, bonds failed to be encouraged by the rally in the pound. All speculative issues, notably the rails, were weak m the late trading.
Rail Equipment
The complete stagnation in the railroad equipment field is attested to by the 10 months report covering number of new cars and locomotives placed in service for the period, and orders on hand. Class 1 railroads in the period this year placed in service only 37 new locomotives. Even in the first 10 months of 1931, when the railroads felt the pineh of hard times, 114 new locomotives were put in service. Freight car figures, on a percentage basis, were even worse. New cars put in service in the first 10 months of the year were less than a quarter of. the total for the corresponding penod of 1931.
The drop in equipment buying reflects the dire straits of the carriers. When railroad traffic comes back to anything like normal levels, equipment buying will be heavy, because new equipment pays for itself in reduced operating expenses. Old cars and old locomotives consume more fuel, require a larger amount of repair work, and give poorer service than the new.
The fact that they had purchased a large amount of new equipment just before the depression set in has been a majo** " ctor *n enabling the Chesapeake & Ohio	.ne Erie to
make good showings.
Central’s Loadings
For both Atchison and Central, the loadings figures indicated that the decline in traffic from the previous week was less than the normal Thanksgiving week dip. Theie is a good prospect that loadings for the country as a whole, for tbe week ended November 26, will record the smallest percentage decline from the like T931 week for any comparison so far. Last year, loadings for the November 26 week were down around 90,000 cars from the previous week, about the normal shrinkage in number of cars.
Incidentally, the November earnings reports of aeveral railroads will be a good deal better than anticipated. Chesapeake &: Ohio’s traffic in November ran ahead of November, 1931, and there should be a sizeable gain in net over the like 1931 month. In November. 1931, Chesapeake & Ohio had net equal to 20 cents a share on the common stock.
Steel Preferred
From the start of trading yesterday, U. S. Steel preferred was a soft spot. It sank rapidly early, falling to a low just above 64, off about three points from Tuesday's final quotation. A factor contributing to the weakness in the stock may have .been that a trust company advised clients needing income to switch out of Steel preferred.
Nickel Plate
Backers of the Nickel Plate’s reorganization plan are trying one more maneuver to save the road from receivership. They arc hopeful that, if the R. F. C. will give the road now the loan it authorized to aid the refinancing program, and let it distribute the money to the depositing noteholders, most of the hold-outs will come in, and the plan will succeed. The possibility of getting actual cash, at this time, is enticing.
The R. F. C. approved the Nickel Plate loan on condition that “substantially all” the notes should be deposited under the refinancing plan. Only 82 % have been deposited. What the R. F.
C.	may consider is what will happen if it docs grant the Nickel Plate’s plea, advance vtbe money, and still have some holdouts. Saving the Nickel Plate is very much up to the noteholders.
