Abreast of the Market
A bull market was signalled under the Dow Theory yesterday as the industrial average convincingly confirmed February action of the railroads in surpassing the 1947 highs. On volume of 3,840,000 shares, largest since May 21, 1940, the industrial index closed up 3.78 to 188.60, well over a full point higher than the top achieved last July and the best price since before the post-Labor Day break in 1946
Under the Dow Theory, yesterday’s action means that a bull market has be—n under way since May. 1947. but does not guarantee either the duration or extent of the trend.
Railroads did even better than industrials yesterday on a percentage basts, closing up 2.33 at 62.24. t.ie best price sinc*v August 23. 1946. Utilities added 0 45. to 35 54. the highest point rcr~'’~d b-*	> s
last October. Advances of one to two points were commonplace. Leaders up thice or more points included Atchison at 314%, up 3%; Delaware & Hudson 48’4, up 3’4? Union Pacific 189, up 7. and Union Carbide 124. up 4.
The tape, which fell behind floor transactions briefly after the opening, was as much os three minutes late for a 20-minute period around 12:30 o’clock and as much as five minutes late during the last 45 minutes of the session Thus, for more than one-fifth the entire session, trading was at too fast a pace to be recorded in customary procedure. The 1.850.000 shares which changed hands after 2 p.m. was the largest volume for a single hour since May 14. 1940. when 1.380,000 shares were traded in the final hour

: Cuban Sugars—
I Followers of the Cuban sugar companies 1 expect the industry to show good profits this year although somewhat under the extra-I ordinary results reported last year. Still these I shares are around their lows for the season
Profits in 1947 were swelled to rccoid levels by a post-war peak in sugar prices, a record Cuban sugar crop which found a ready market. plus the addition of substantial unrealized income from 1946 operations. Many companies as a result are in the strongest financial position ever. Cuban sugai men attribute the lack of market interest in the companies to a number of disturbing factors Foremost is a iack of confidence in the Cuban government attitude towards the industry. It forced the companies to maintain sugar wages this year it the high levels of 1947 although sugar nrices have slipped sharply The companies are to be reimbursed after the sugar season ends through tax refunds. To what exrent this will compensate for increased wage costs is not known.
Recently the government seized a mill owned by American interests involving a dispute over the price the mill should pay for cane. Sugar men a’so criticize the various segregations of the 1948 crop by Cuba undertaken partly in an ehort to bolster prices I This has created confusion in the industry and impeded the free sale of sugar. World sugar demand and production is now considered about in balance, taking into account the lack of purchasing power among many foreign consuming countries. Production has been coming back rapidly. Cuba as a result may have to return to restricted sugar crops next year, some quarters feel. Production of the 1948 Cuban sugar crop to April 30 had reached 5.C53.000 short tons, or about 625.000 tons •?rper than in the similar period last year. The ’947 croD established a new record at 6,448 000 tons. At the current pace Cuban output this ■ ear could approach 7 mil’ion tons.

that Electric Storage Battery Co. is studying its price structure with an idea of adjusting prices to compensate for tile recent increase of more than 16% in the price of lead. Costs of other materials and labor also have risen since Storage Battery increased prices ol its automotive replacement units by an average of about 10% m Apnl, 1947, to compensate for previous boosts in the prices of lead, antimony, rubber and other materials used tn battery making. Over 50% of the weight of a battery is lead. Since the end of the first quarter, the market price of lead has increased to 17^2 cents from 15 cents. Narrowing profit margins in the past year are indicated by the fact that although net sales of Storage Battery jumped 34% in the March quarter over a year ago to $24.3 million, net income ran slightly below results for the earlier period However, it recently was stated by the company that the first quarter net covered the 75-cent quarterly dividend of $680,857 “by a comfortable margin.” Storage Battery reports earnings on a semi-annual basis.
Storage Battery and its consolidated subsidiaries paid out $34 million for lead last year compared with $15 million in 1946. The dollar value of the firm’s lead inventories were at a record high at the close of 1947. and the company set aside from last year’s earnings a reserve ot $1 million as a hedge against possible decline in inventory values.	’	‘
centralization program to place operations closer to markets. Storage Battery and subsidiaries last year spent $2.3 million to complete construction and equipment of new plants and for expansion of existing facilities. The program this year provides for the acquisition and equipment of a new automotive battery plant at Atlanta, Ga Storage Battery has paid dividends each quarter since 1900.

American Can Co.—
A continuing heavy demand for American Can Co. products, more than can be met with materials now available, is perhaps one reason for the new high recently attained by the company’s common -	-	-	-
present demand there is buyers market for the industry’ for some time, president. D \V Figgis, told stockholders last month that the physical volume of shipments in the first quarter this year was substantially ahead of the like 1947 quarter He warned stockholders, however, that the same rate of gain cannot be expected for the next three quarters of this xtar. The reason for this, he sajd. is that production of some containers had not been fully resumed in the flrst quarter of 1947.
But physical and dollar volume of sales m the first six months of this year are definitely expected to be higher than for the like The entire can manufacturing continue to be affected by the control over tin. Mr. Figgis, taken the position that some government control, for a limited period. is essential to the industry’s long range welfare, to its customer industries and to the general public.	’
Net dollar sales of the company la*t year were S33S.163.242 compared with 5258 065.461 the year before. Its actual consumption of metals was higher than 1946 and about 50% over the 1936-1940 average and its use of paper and fibre showed an oven greater percentage increase Net income from operations was S21.S36.624 against $8,828,983 in 1946, which before S2 5 million for possible inventory* pnee decline was equal to $7 66 a common share compared with 52.40 a share the year before. The company spent about $24 million a year for its post-war modernization and expansion program during 1946 and 1947. It is planning to spend approximately the same amount this year. A good part of this will be used to expand products it has pioneered in recent years like the flat top fibre milk container.
