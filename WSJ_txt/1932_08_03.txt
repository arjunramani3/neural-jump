payment, and the request of J. P. Morgan & Co. that holders of AUeghany Corp. 5s of 1944 give their names, when turning in their coupons, is merely an example of the recently instituted practice. As one banker put it, the institution with which he is connected recently started getting names of holders of certain bonds "just in case.”
The procedure is eminently practical. At no extra cost, the corporation can get a list of its bondholders which it might have to procure at fairly large expense. It is a forehanded move, putting the corporation in possession of a list of the individuals and institutions with which it will have to deal should the distressing event of receivership occur. It should greater speed in attempting to work solution of the corporation's affairs.
So far as the Alleghany Corp.’s
permit out a:
Karly dullness in the se» unties markets was succeeded by an outburst of strength that set in shortly after noon yesterday, sending both bonds and stocks rushing upward, with pivotal issues reaching new highs on the recovery movement. The turnabout in stocks was particularly impressive with wide advances scored on heavy vplume. Bonds were a bit ragged early, but firmed up. and many railroad obligations forged steadily ahead in the late trading, pushing into new high giound
The stimulus tor the advance came fiom a number of quarters In the first place, commodity markets were higher, wheat just about recovering the losses suffeted in Tuesday’s tiad-mg. and cotton running up about 10 points The action of the bond market, too. served to inspire confidence, for profit taking in recent sessions has not brought any important recessions in prices.	t
Word from Washington that full consideration was being given to loans to railroads to increase maintenance work, and for the purchase of new equipment, served to bring aggressive buying into stocks such as Air Reduction. which would be among the companies benefiting most lrom any upturn in railroad equipment maintenance work Oils were firm on the encouraging figures fo- the most recent week showing fuxther improvement m the industry statistical position
The fact that electrical output for the week ended .July 30 showed a smaller decline from the corresponding 1931 week than did the previous week brought buying into pivotal utility stocks, like Consolidated Gas and Public Service of New Jersey.
_	.	_ paying
agents' action is concerned, it can b^stated authoritatively that it has "no immediate significance. There is nothing brewing in the corporation's affairs at the present time. As a matter of fact, the 5s of 1944 arc the best secured of i any of the corporation’s three collateral trust bund issues. and even after payment of the I August 1 interest, the trustee had pledged under the issue somewhere around $750,000 in cash, in addition to the deposited securities. Income 1 from pledged securities still is sufficient to cover ' annual interest requirements on the bonds.
■	The other two issues, particularly the 5s of
■	1950. are not so well off, with income from se-• curitiev below annual interest requirements on
the bonds.
[ Short Interest Built T’p ‘ In Brief Reaction Period
Inquiry among several brokerage houses yesterday morning revealed skepticism toward any near-term resumption of the recent rise in the market When stocks pushed ahead, the ad- i vance was aided by short covering from indi- ! viduals who wore impressed by the resiliency of pivotal stocks.	'	,
In a number of issues, good buying was evident at around previous resistance points on the j downside. The appearance of this buying did j much tn bring on covering and new purchasing of stocks	j

Ingersoll Rand Ip .Around 70% Front Low
Al its current price of around 27, Ingersoll I Rand common is up almost 100'. from the low 1 of the year, but the stock still is selling for ■ only a little mure than the net quick assets, after allowing for preferred stock, for each common share, on the basis of the balance sheet for the end of 1931. At that time, net quick assets amounted to $25 90 for each common share.
Inger-oll Rand was one of the "high flyers" of the bull markets, and present prices me less than a tenth, even, of the 1930 high for the stock. While the company has suffered through ' the falling-off in its business, which brought ' about a net loss of $165,721 in 1931. there are 1 prospect.-' that heavy projects in contemplation, , to be financed by loans from the Reconstruction , Finance Corp . might bring about a turn in the company's business. Prospects for any increase in demand for its products from the mining seem slim at the present time
While the company showed a loss m 1931, a part of it was due to the continued heavy depreciation charges, which do not represent an actual cash outgo. At	*
