Stocks Turn down With Wheat and Cotton , A late downturn in wheat and cotton prices, ; and-, banking troubles in the mid-west, confined to small institutions, put an effective damper on a feeble recovery in stock prices in'the first session of the new week. Firmness during the first four hours of trading was converted Into heaviness in the final hour, and stocks closed not . far from the day's lows, with -the leaders down ; as much as 3 or 4 points. The volatile issues, like Auburn and Case, were the chief sufferers. ' Auburn was off 4% on the day, and Case closed at'4411, off	The decline was general
throughout the list, but the rails managed to ] hold their ground a little better than other : groups of stocks. The tobaccos were the firm- ' eat spot among industrial issues. "	'
The bond market yras spotty. Carrier issues ' were mixed, some railroad bonds moving higher : on the day, in contrast to heaviness elsewhere. Foreign obligations were uniformly soft. The high-grade utility bonds Held their own, meeting the same kind of investment demand which has been so persistent recently.
’ "Wheat moved fractionally higher in the morning-. The late sell-off, however, carried the major cereal down for losses which ran from % to % cents at the finish. Cotton was down 12 to 16 points on the day.
The banking troubles in the mid-west included the closing of eight small Institutions In St. Louis. The day's fatalities brought the total closings in the last 10 days to .16 in the St. Louis area. A two weeks’ banking holiday was declared in Moline, East Moline and Rock Island, in Illinois, to afford a breathing spell from recent withdrawals. 'Generally depressed conditions in the two areas have precipitated the banking difficulties.
Steel Shading New* Reflected
Week-end developments gave the market very little nourishment. The upward movement in the rate of steel operations was in line-with the normal, seasonal trend, but more attention was paid to comment on price shading included in the week-end reviews than to the betterment in the operating rate. United States Steel common and preferred suffered, too, over the uncertainties which surround -the approaching meeting of directors to consider action on the preferred dividend payment. The meeting is scheduled for January 31-
The St. Paul and the Atchison loadings reports for the week ended January 14 were inconclusive. They showed a good upturn over the previous week, which included the New Year holiday slump, and a somewhat smaller decline from the like 1932 week than has been the case recently. Railroad stocks, however, eased off with the rest of the list, although they were not conspicuously heavy. Some of the speculative favorites, like- Delaware, Lackawanna & Western and Southern Pacific, which have attracted a weak long following, lost more than a point, and Union Pacific was down 2.	'
The news from Washington certainly did not help the market. The prospects are that no major legislation will be put through during the present session, and the country will have to wait until a special Bession in the spring for any action on pressing problems.
Traction stocks came in for some attention early. Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corp, common set a new high on the move, above 30, before the announcement was made that the company would retire, on February 1, $1,000,000 principal amount of its 2-year, 6% notes, and make provision for retirement of another $750,000 of the short-term issue. Assuming the company’s earnings hold up to present levels, it should be able to pay off at least $4,500,000 of the notes in a year.	"
The markets abroad were heavy. The list on the Paris Bourse was weak, and in London prices moved irregularly lower.
Wide Market
Efforts to get a prospective buyer- and seller of National Lead together on a price for the stock attracted attention yesterday. The first bid price was 5214. with the would-be seller asking 120. Quotations'appeared at intervals narrowed the spread to 52^-110, 57-100, and then down to 60-80. No sale took place. The last transaction in the stock was at 57Vs.
Theatre Seat Price Cut*
The sweeping cuts in theatre ticket prices, which have become general in New York, put the playhouses in position to give the big, first-run motion picture theatres some stiff competition. Under the new scales, balcony seats in some cases are down in the same price area as prices for similar seats in big movie houses.
Seat price reductions in movie houses recently have again plagued the Industry. They have been made in an effort to Increase volume of attendance. By establishing a new level of box office income, the reduced seat prices make imperative further reductions in aim production costs.	>
a “Macy” flavor. For instance, instead of guarantees, in some cases items are listed as/'recommended ’by^Ward’s Bureau'of-Standards.” Walter Hoving, formerly 'executive vice president of R. H. Macy & Co.,' joined-Montgomery Ward as executive vice president and general sales	in the spring of 1932.
Chain Store Receiverships
Receiverships fpr two chain store companies last week ha-?e drawn further attention to chain store' company troubles. Not only have they had to meet difficulties, engendered by falling prices, and lower volume of business, but rentals have assumed major importance. The burden1 of rentals may not have been the immediate factor precipitating trouble for companies, but It has been of great importance in aggravating their difficulties. Companies which-expanded from 1927 through 1930 And themselves tied up with leases which, on the current "	'
business, are too burdensome to be
Appreciation of 25%
Among investment trust reports, Gude Winmill Trading Corp, showed ference from those for some of the larger organizations. The break-up value of the stock at the end of 1932 was 25% higher than at the close of 1931, quite a feat in view of the general market’s performance last year. At the close of 1932, the corporation had about 60% of its assets	_	_	......._

Ward’* Nrw Catalogue	'
' Montgomery Ward’s spring and summer catalogue has some radical deviations from recent annual numbers, reflecting further changes introduce^ by the group which took over the management more than a year ago. The catalogue makes more temperate claims In regard to merchandise, and again Is stressing style appeal, partlculr.rly in the fashion section.
The firming price tendency revealed by the catalogue is the most vital development from ' the point of view of profit possibilities. Ward has taken heavy’ Inventory losses annually through the depression years. With any stability of retail prices, these losses should be eliminated, and put an enfirely different complexion on the company's Income accounts.	-
Some sections of Ward’s new catalogue Have
