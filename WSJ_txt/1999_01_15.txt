Coming off Friday's impressive snapback rally in small stocks and the overall market, investors are wondering whether the long-anticipated outperformance of the smallstock sector is possible.
"Investors making so much money in smaller, volatile names seem to be going to company-specific situations, and it's primarily retail (small-investor) related," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "So long as the market stays healthy, you'll eventually get a lot of attention in small-caps across the board."
Friday, small-capitalization issues followed the broader market higher, as the Russell 2000 index, a widely followed measure of small-cap performance, tacked on 6.95, or 1.65%, to 427.05. For the week, the Russell 2000 fell 4.18, or 0.97%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index added 3.79, or 0.2%, to 2348.20 after posting its fourth-best one-day point gain ever, 71.38 points, or 3.14%, on Friday.
