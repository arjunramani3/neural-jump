Additional reports on the stepping* up of industrial operations, and pronounced strength in the commodities markets, served as a background for another rise in security prices yesterday to the highest levels of the recovery movement in all groups of stocks. Declaration of the customary quarterly payment of $1.50 a share on the common stock by directors of Union Pacific brought an extension of the rally in the carrier shares. Reports that the Administration’s advisers in Washington had agreed on the industrial legislation to be presented to Congress, and also on a program of public and semi-public construction, involving an expenditure of $3,300,000,000, also whetted the appetite for stocks and bonds.
As far as groups of stocks were concerned, the utilities showed as large an improvement, on a percentage basis, as any other. Metal shares ranged upward, led by Anaconda, Ken-necott, and American Metals. A sharp run-up in Union Pacific was a feature m the railroad group, and Allied Chemical, du Pont and Continental Can were among the strong spots in the old-time leaders in the industrials. The Dow-Jones industrial average, at the close, was more than a full point through the high of September, 1932. Gains in some stocks ran to 5 points. Trading volume surged upward on the further upswing in stocks, reaching 6,160,000 shares, the biggest volume since April 20.
All grains reached new season's highs in heavy trading, with the government’s crop report, indicating the lowest winter wheat outturn since 1901, an insistent spur to wheat buying. The gains in wheat were no more sharp than those in corn. Wheat finished up 2}« to 2“« cents a bushel, while corn closed up to 2’/h cents. Rye gained more than 4 cents a bushel on the day. Cotton opened with a sharp advance, and finished up $1.50 a bale.
The strong forward movement in all classes of bonds continued with no decline in vigor. All classes of domestic corporation issues shared in the upswing, but advances were most pronounced in industrial and second-grade railroad issues. Governments moved up again, and foreign obligations were higher.
Industrial and utility stocks led the market upward m London. Ronds lagged on the advance. In Paris, prices on the Bourse were strong, with the exception of rentes.
Steel Upturn Aids Refractory Companies
The upturn in steel operations, and the general betterment in the industry, have benefited the refractory companies, among others. These companies in normal times do a large business in furnishing fire brick to line furnaces, and magnesite for flooring of furnaces. In the past, an upward curve in the steel operating rate has been closely fallowed by the trend of refractory company earnings, but in circles close to the refractory companies, it is maintained that their business should pick up faster than that of the steel industry, based on the fact that over the past three years, steel industries have borne down heavily on operating expenses, and have reduced expenditures for relining furnaces drastically. One large unit in the industry not so long ago moved all the fire brick from one of its shut-down furnaces to another plant, some distance away, in order to avoid purchasing new brick. Price-cutting also has troubled the refractory companies in the past two years, but this is reported to have been eliminated now.
The two major units in the refractories industry are General Refractories and Harbison-Walker, Harbison-Walker, in 1932, reported a net loss of $609,952, compared with a profit of 51*284,346 in 1931. General Refractories had a loss of $2,023,137 in 1932, as against a loss of $236,820 in 1931. At the end of 1932. Harbison-Walker had current assets of $4,919,027, including $696,663 in cash. Current liabilities were $2,185,988, including bank loans of $2,050,000. Harbison has outstanding 30,000 shares of 6% preferred stock ahead of 1,440,000 common shares
Foreign Sulphur Busina Picks Up
One business which has felt a distinct change since America abandoned the gold standard, and our currency started declining in the foreign exchange markets, is the sulphur industry. While there has been some improvement in the domestic sulphur business of the Freeport Texas Co. recently, there has been quite a sharp betterment in foreign sales since late April.
Continental OH
The latest listing statement of the Continental Oil Co. of Delaware, submitted in connection with the company’s application to change Its common stock from $5 par to nopar, has one or two interesting items which did not appear in the previous listing statement. One of these items is a table showing how the capital stock of the company has been increased from time to time, and changes which have taken place.
The initial issuance of the company’s stock was in exchange for Marland Refinery Co. stock, and amounted to 496,335 shares. The largest block of the stock of the present company was in exchange for 2.296.681 shares of Continental Oil of Maine. A block of 300,000 shares was issued In exchange for cash to J. P_ Morgan &. Co. at $30 a share, and another block of 335,000 shares was issued to the same bankers at $40 a share.
corn prices, due largely to poor weather In the com belt, has brought new strength into hog prices.
Dard prices moved up also, gaining a quarter of a cent a pound. The advance in both hogs and lard prices proved stimulating to the packing company shares. They also were benefited by indications from Washington that President Roosevelt would contribute to the world tariff truce by bolding up the imposition of tariffs authorized in the farm relief bill.
Soft Coal Output Turns Up
Bituminous coal output, in the week ended May 6, is estimated at 4,825,000 tons, 350,000 tons above output in the similar week of 1932 and ahead of production in the previous week. The upturn in soft coal output means better loadings for the leading bituminous coal carriers, and higher earnings for them.
Statistically, the industry is in a much better shape than it was a year ago, with stocks dQwn sharply. Rising consumption of coal, due to the step-up in industrial production, means that coal production should continue at a relatively high rate. Stocks of coal in industrial consumers hands, on April 1. were down to 18,708,000 or 16.4% under stocks on hand at the start of the previous quarter.
Oakland Bridge Steel Tonnage
Final figures on the steel to be used in the Oakland-San Francisco Bridge shows that the tonnage Involved is somewhat larger than previous figures indicated. Columbia Steel Co., the western unit of United States Steel, was awarded the contract for the 122,350 tons of steel for the bridge superstructure, and also for 20.700 tons of cables and fastenings and other minor items *which brought the total involved In the contract to 152,735 tons of steel.

Hogs Reach New Highs
Prices for hogs moved upward in Chicago yesterday, reaching the best prices since last September and better than the top levels set In March. During the banking holiday, hog prices went up in Chicago, thereby continuing the record established last summer of foreshadowing a general Increase In prices. Until the last few days, however, hogs have not followed the strong upward trend of other commodity markets. The spectacular upturn in
