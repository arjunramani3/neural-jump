Prior to the upheaval that knocked stocks sharply lower early last week, small-cap stocks had been outperforming larger ones. But analysts doubt small-cap stocks will resume their market-leadership role anytime soon.
"We're seeing a lot of small-cap stocks turning, but it will take some time” before they begin outperforming the rest of the market, said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann.
"For two weeks, emotional investing took over from fundamental investing,” Mr. Dwyer said. “As the dust settles, people will go back to looking at fundamentals."

After a significant market disruption, such as the one the market went through last week, when Investors move back into stocks, "the first place they'll go is bluechip growth-oriented stocks," Mr. Dwyer said.
Investors, he said, are drawn to "more proven equities," with the benefits of strong performance and high liquidity, "so they can get out if there are more problems."
