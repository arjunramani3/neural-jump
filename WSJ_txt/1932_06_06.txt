While the hcwb continued generally favorable in tenor, particularly that from Washington In regard to the tax bill, stocks reacted yesterday, partly as result of profit-taking. Bonds were irregular, the more speculative issues generally showing losses. Grains were weak, and cotton was down as much as $1 a bale at one time.
The advance in the three trading sessions ended Saturday carried the Dow-Jones average of 30 industrials up to 30.88 at Saturday's close, a gain of more than 13% from the low on May 31. After such a rapid upswing, some reaction was to be anticipated. In view of the acute weakness in some special issues, the general list held fairly well.
Senatorial action on the tax bill was perhaps the most' favorable of the day's developments. The point of order, raised against agreement by the Senatorial conferees to the change in the levy on electrical energy sold by power companies, was overruled by the chair. In addition, prospects for the National economy measure have been brightened by the Senate’s action in voting favorably on Government salary reductions. With the tax bill and the economy program out of the way, Wall Street would be able to draw a much relieved breath. The only other vital piece of legislation is the unemployment relief measure, on which a struggle is indicated.
There are plenty of other important matters on the calendar for this month. They include the Lausanne Conference, and the national conventions of the two major parties in this country. As a factor on the course of the markets in this country, Lausanne is the most important.
The day’s news included payment of the regular quarterly dividend by Detroit Edison. The payment was accompanied by a statement from the president, warning stockholders that unless there was a substantial improvement in business, the dividend would be the last at the current rate. Lambert common was put on a $4 annual basis, but an extra of ?1 was declared with the JI quarterly dividend at the new rate, so stockholders are not yet out of pocket as result of the change. The regular quarterly payment was declared on International Nickel preferred. The stock closed Saturday at 55, where It gelded around 13% on the $7 annual dividend.
Weekly steel operations figures disclosed that, for the week ended June 4, a new low* level of 21% had been set. Soft coal output figures reflected a continuation of the decline, and a number of reports of companies gave further testimony to the prevailing low* rate of business activity.
Among Individual stocks, Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit common and preferred were particularly weak. Directors of the company meet for dividend action June 20, and a number of rumors in regard to what action might be taken were abroad. Official comment was not available.
Investors Still Advised To Await Definite Trend
In conservative quarters, the action of stocks yesterday was regarded as indecisive. With constructive news, it is held that the market might work slowly higher for the time being. However, investors are still advised to wait until the course of the market is more clearly outlined, or to purchase stocks only on setbacks.
Rally In Bonds Big ; Help to Union Pacific 1 The swift rally in railroad bond prices has I caused a marked appreciation in the value of
the Union Pacific’s large Investments in senior securities of non-affiliated carriers. The drastic decline in railroad bond prices was an unsettling factor in the Union Pacific picture, and the recovery in the bond market is distinctly reassuring to the road’s security holders.
The road has, among other railroad bond investments, 13 blocks of railroad obligations of a principal amount of $38,214,000. These include Baltimore A Ohio, Chicago A North Western, SL Paul, Great Northern, Illinois Central, New York Central, Pennsylvania and Southern Pacific issues. The appreciation in price of these bonds at Saturday's close, over the year's low, amounted to $3,214,000, or roughly 13.6% of the principal amount. The appreciation from the low was approximately 30%.
The gain has been particularly large in certain individual blocks. For instance, Union Pacific owns $6,399,000 principal amount of Southern Pacific Co., Central Pacific stocW collateral 4s, due 1955. These bonds have rallied from 29 to 47, and on the block, the gain in market value over the low totals $1,151,000. A 15-point advance in Southern Pacific first and refunding 4s meant an appreciation in the Union Pacific’s holding, amounting to $6,026,000, of roughly $903,000. The 22-point recovery in Great Northern 7s added $220,000 to the market value of Union Pacific’s block of $1,000,000 of these bonds.
Lake Coal Movement Shows Gain in Week
Movement of coal to Lake Erie ports is on an uptrend, latent figures of the Bureau of Mines indicate. While the major movement of coal is not likely to get under way until the latter half of this month, the upward curve in the figures of coal shipments is encouraging.
Dumpings of coal into vessels at Lake Erie ports in the week ended May 29 totaled 582,189 tons, against 498,364 tons in the preceding week and 420,507 tons in the week ended May 15, For the season to May 29, dumpings have totaled 3,260,636 tons, against 4,684,050 tons to the like date in 1931 and 8,233,029 tons for the season, so far, in 1930.	,
Anthracite shipments from the Lake ports clearly reflect the lessened demand. For the season, so far. shipments have totaled 38.745 tons, against 176,010 tons in the corresponding 1931 period.
Preferred Stocks Lend In Market Rally
The rallies in some preferred stocks during the period of market recovery have far outrun, on a percentage basis, gains in most common stocks. For instance. American Car A Foundry preferred, ran up from the low of 18 to 30, a gain of more than 50%, and American Smelting 6% preferred, which sold down to 171!*, rallied to 27. Many utility preferred stocks Bhowed particularly sharp lecoveries, due partly to the change in the provision in the tax bill for a tax on electric energy sold. Commonwealth A Southern preferred, for instance, closed at 35’^, Saturday, where it was up 8 points from the low, a gain of roughly 30%.
The low* prices for many stocks, including preferred issues, now prevailing, definitely limit the risks assumed by the purchaser. In addition, the possibilities of profit, on a basis of the percentage of the amount invested, are larger than at any time in recent financial history.
