Compiatc tntiulatinn of the Dow-Jonoa agot, with charto, second from iatt gage.		flock aver-
Securities markets yesterday reflected increasing Wall Street pessimism over the outlook, due to continued unfavorable business news which had no offsettingg favorable developments in Washington. Stocks gave ground easily, particularly railroad shareB, and new lows were set by such leaders as Atchison, Union Pacific, New York Central and Baltimore A onio.
Selling In the rails was influenced by the break of the Dow-.Tnncs railroad average below the April 13 resistance point. In addition, monthly carrier reports were depressing, revealing the drastic reduction in current assets of most carriers and the increase in current liabilities. Missouri Pacific common and preferred stocks were particularly weak.
Among special issues, United Aircraft preferred and International Combustion preferred both struck air pockets, showing losses of mon than 5 points each. New Haven preferred dropped sharply also, on uncertainty over the outlook for continuance of the'burrent <7 dividend rate. Officials of the company have stated that the dividend would be paid only if earned, and currently this is not being accomplished.
Wall Street’s reaction to the governmental program for unemployment relief was distinctly mixed. The injection of a new and uncertain factor into the financial situation at this time, however, was unsettling.
The current picture of the securities market is far from cheerful. The heavy declines in some sections of the bond list have brought prices to a level where they seem to have discounted even the gloomiest predictions. With sentiment so pessimistic, however, this is no proof that rallying power will be shown.
In the two-day sharp decline In stocks, losses of 10% from the recent recovery highs are scattered fairly liberally through the list. While some technical rally should develop, a sidelines position is being advised in many quarters.
Rullroad Bonds Well Deflated
The drastic deflation in the bond market has carried obligations of railroads down to a point where the value the market places on the properties seems out of line, in many cases, with the earning power of the roads, even at current low levels of traffic. At present prices for its funded obligations, the value the market places on the Missouri Pacific, for instance, is roughly <160,000,000, including equipment trusts and secured obligations to banks and the Reconstruction Finance Corp, at par, and without giving consideration to the equity. The value the market places on the road's general and refunding mortgage bonds is approximately <66,000,000, compared with a principal amount of roughly <224,000.000 outstanding at the close of 1931.
Missouri Pacific bad gross revenues in 1931 of <95.268,192. and Indications are that gross this year will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $75,000,000. While the percentage of net railway operating income saved from gross has declined in the first three month? this year, the first quarter is not a fair criterion of what the results for the year should be in this regard. Assuming that the showing is less favorable than in 1931, it would seem that the net railway operating income of the Missouri Pacific alone this year, on the present indicated gross, should afford a return of better than 7% on the current market valuation of the fixed Interest bearing obligations of the property.
Before the year is out the question of renewal of short-term loans to the road will have to be considered, and unless there is an
upturn in traffic, serious financing matters will come up for determination early next year.
Transit Unification , Only Delayed
Developments before the Seabury committee probably will prove a temporary damper on transit unification proposals, but in the long run, the real test of unfication is not its political advisability but its economic soundness. The city has constructed the Eighth Avenue line, and so far it has proved merely a dead weight on the city's revenues. The city can operate it municipally at a loss, or it can lease it to an operator, with the very definite prospect, according to testimony before the Board of Transportation, that it will be run at a loss.
So long as the city's financial conditions will permit absorption of the losses in the budget, to say nothing of payment of carrying charges on the investment, the city can delay a real solution of the problem. So far, the only financially Bound solution that has been offered is unification.
Rail Equipment
On Replacement Basis ,
Statement of orders booked by Baldwin Locomotive Works and aubsidiaries for April, showing bookings in the month of only <663000, compared with $1,260,000 In April, 1931, clearly ahowa the effect of low railroad traffic on the orders received by equipment makers. All the business booked by Baldwin in April was for locomotive parts, or was contributed by affiliates of the Baldwin group.
As of April 1, the car service division of the American Railway Association reported that carriers in this country had 10,193 serviceable locomotives stored, ready to be put in service when traffic picks up. As of the same date, the report showed, 7,642 locomotives were in the shop or awaiting Bhop repairs, compared with 5,967 at the corresponding date of 1931. About the best locomotive builders can look for for some time to come, it would seem, is orders for parts for rebuilding motive power, unless rail traffic turns up.
C. & O. Expect* Coal Upturn
Dumping of coal by the Chesapeake & Ohio at the road's coal docks at Presque Isle began on March 4, and up to May 10, the road bad dumped 610,803 tons at the docks. Loadings of both lake and other coals for May are llkeiy to be light, in the opinion of the management. After May, officials of the road anticipate a pick-up in coal traffic.
