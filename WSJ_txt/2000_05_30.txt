Treasurys prices fell as investors shifted money from bonds into a resurging stock market, though activity was limited while investors looked ahead to several economic releases scheduled for this week.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32 point, or $3.125 per $1,000 face value, to 100 26/32. Its yield rose to 6.363% from 6.324% Friday, as yields move inversely to prices.
Investors often shift money from stocks to bonds when stock prices plummet and then back when stocks are recovering. Yesterday, such cross-market flows took place as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 227.89 points to 10527.13 and the Nasdaq Composite Index soared 254.37 points to 3459.48.

NEW YORK -- Treasurys prices fell as investors shifted money from bonds into a resurging stock market, though activity was limited while investors looked ahead to several economic releases scheduled for this week.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32 point, or $3.125 per $1,000 face value, to 100 26/32. Its yield rose to 6.363% from 6.324% Friday, as yields move inversely to prices.
Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond's price fell 14/32 to 102 4/32 to yield 6.083%, up from 6.054% Friday.
Trading halted early Friday ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, and the market was closed Monday.
Investors often shift money from stocks to bonds when stock prices plummet and then back when stocks are recovering. Yesterday, such cross-market flows took place as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 227.89 points to 10527.13 and the Nasdaq Composite Index soared 254.37 points to 3459.48.
"There must have been some money parked in the short end of the Treasurys market as the stock market was working through its problems [last week]. Some of that money flowed back into equities," said Tony Crescenzi, chief executive of bond information Web site Bondtalk.com in New York.
Price declines in Treasurys were modest considering news that consumer confidence jumped in May, analysts said.
The Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment rose to 144.4 in May from 137.7 in April. May's reading was the highest level since January.
Bond investors worry that rising confidence will fuel stronger consumer spending, sparking further economic growth and posing an increased risk of inflation. And, analysts added, that likely is a concern for Federal Reserve officials, who are slated to meet late next month to review monetary policy.
"The consumer number was incredibly strong," said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed-income trading at securities firm D.A. Davidson in Seattle. "It's not what the Fed wants to see."
Market expectations about Fed policy will be shaped by economic reports over the next few weeks.
Those reports include the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly survey of manufacturing, scheduled for tomorrow and the Labor Department's monthly assessment of labor market conditions, slated for Friday.
Economists expect the May NAPM index to rise to 55.5 from 54.9 in April. A number above 50 suggests an expansion of manufacturing activity.
Some believe the report could provide an even more bearish picture from a bond perspective, showing that economic activity hasn't slowed much despite six interestrate increases by the Fed since mid-1999. "The NAPM is going to show strong production and inventory building," said Joe Lavorgna, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.
Equally important for the market is the Labor Department report, which many economists expect will show a still-tight labor market, with the unemployment rate remaining at a three-decade low of 3.9%. "People are taking positions ahead of the employment numbers," said Don Kowalchik, a debt strategist at St. Louis brokerage house A.G. Edwards.
Several economic releases are scheduled for today, including the Chicago Purchasing Management Index and the Commerce Department's tally of monthly new home sales.
New home sales, reflecting "a supposedly interest-rate sensitive sector, will be the most important of those today," Ms. Hurley of D.A. Davidson said.
Here are the details of yesterday's auction by the Treasury of 13-week and 26-week bills:

Corporate & Junk Bonds
The spotlight this week is on DaimlerChrysler North America Holding Corp.'s $2 billion e-bond offering, for which investors will be able to place orders over the Web site of lead manager Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The unit of auto giant DaimlerChrysler AG is one of at least five companies expected to sell bonds this week.
DaimlerChrysler's deal is expected to split evenly between five-year and 10-year maturities. Early price talk on the five-year issue is for a yield margin of 0.32 to 0.35 percentage point more than the five-year interest-rate swap rate. The 10-year bonds are expected to price to yield between 0.45 and 0.48 percentage point more than the 10year swap rate.
Other new issues expected to price this week include $750 million of three-year notes from General Electric's General Electric Capital that will be lead managed by Lehman Brothers and UBS Warburg LLC, a $400 million Westvaco two-part offering with Goldman Sachs as lead manager and $350 million of 10-year notes from Lowe's Cos. with Merrill Lynch & Co. as the lead manager.
Lone Star Industries is expected to privately place $500 million of 10-year notes (Baa2/BBB) under Rule 144a.
Foreign Bonds
Rallying U.S. stocks helped to lift many emerging-market debt issues. Among widely followed issues, Brazil's benchmark C-bond rose 1 3/16 to 70 bid, while Mexico's global securities due 2026 gained one point to 111 3/4 bid, traders said.
Argentine debt prices posted modest increases on disappointment over news of smaller-than-expected cuts in government spending. Officials on Monday outlined plans to save $538 million in the current year, less than the $600 million to $1 billion hoped for by bond investors.
Argentina's floating rate bonds rose 1/4 to 90 7/16 bid, while par bonds gained 11/16 to 65 11/16 bid.
Peruvian bonds rebounded after falling initially on the results of the country's presidential election Sunday. Of concern to investors, the U.S. said it didn't recognize as valid the re-election of President Alberto Fujimori. But with Peru's debt trading at what was seen as cheap levels, some investors went bargain hunting. Peru's so-called front-loaded interest reduction bonds jumped 3/4 to 54 1/2 bid.
