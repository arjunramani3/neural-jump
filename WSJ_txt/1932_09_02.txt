The steel stocks led the market into new high ground yesterday, with activity Increasing as the list pushed forward. Bonds, too, were strong, with the second grade railroad issues pushing forward under a renewed demand. Tn-dustrial and utility issues forged ahead, mid there were liberal advances sprinkled throughout the list. Commodities acted better, and the good gains In cotton and wheat served to bring renewed buying into stocks whose prices have a close relation to commodity market movements. Wheat was up around 1 cent a bushel, and cotton closed up more than $2 a bale.
The tone of the market was good at the start, but the early gains were not wide. American Telephone opened up fractionally, and Steel was up about a pointy As the session progressed, activity increased^md^gains became wider. Steel common was ^outstanding leader. It was strong all day^wr^ just before the close surged up to 50, a n^w^high on the current advance. Other steel company shares, like American Rolling Mill, Republic Steel common, A. M. Byers and Inland Steel all were higher, a number of the lower price issues reaching new high ground for the year.
The enthusiasm for the steel shares was due to indications of a pickup in operations in at least two centers. Youngstown operations next week will be about double those of the current week, according to estimates. The news from Youngstown came on the heels of the despatch from Cleveland, estimating that production in that district for next week would be around 26% of theoretical capacity, compared with 12% for the past fortnight. Another factoi^vin the rising market for qteel stocks was the strength in scrap prices.
Railrad issues were a secondary feature of the market. The more volatile issues, like Delaware, Lackawanna & Western, Reading and Lehigh Valley, rocketed upward. Reading second preferred which closed Thursday night at 25 bid, 30 offered, ran up from around 31 to 38 in a comparatively few sales. The leaders. like Atchison. Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, were generally higher.
The day’s news included a mark-up in the domestic price of copper to 6 cents a pound, on advance of % cent a pound. Textile centers reported increased activity. Du Pont announced an advance in the price of rayon. Coal loadings at Lake Brie ports, in the week ended August 29. continued the recent sharp improvement, although still far below the total for the like 1931 week.
Motor registration figures were poor, but automobile company stocks moved higher. General Motors was the leader, reaching a new top on the current upswing. A block of 20.000 shares changed hands at 17. fractionally under the day’s high of 17 the closing figure.
Markets abroad were uniformly strong. In Berlin, stocks have risen in the face of bank selling of securities. Mining shares In London were particularly firm, while the Paris Bourse was higher all around.
The upswing in the market carried the Dow-Jones averages on industrials, rails and utilities into new high ground for the recovery. The rails were up just a point from the previous high, set Thursday: the, industrials slightly more than a point above the mark set August 27, and the utilities fractionally above the high reached August 29.
time deposits $54,000,000. Despite «epavising loans and investments, the ratio of these items to total deposits has fallen from 111.6 on July 20 to 109.9 on August 31. So long as such a strong ratio is maintained and banks have substantial excess reserves, money rates are certain to Temaln extremely easy.* '
Last week's $7,000,000 increase in currency circulation is considerably smaller than usual for the month-end, and by no means indicates a resumption of hoarding! A year ago, circulation rose $41,000,000 in the corresponding week; while in 1930 and 1929 t&e increases were $64,000,000 and $81,000,000, respectively. Federal Reserve notes in circulation dropped more tHan $10,000,000, despite the use in total circulation, indicating 'that National Bank notes are "being issued in considerable volume.
Scrap Price Advance Striking
The upswing in prices for steel scrap in Youngstown in the last 30 days is little short of sensational. Yesterday's increase brought the total ’•ecent advance tp $2 a ton, a gain of 25% in the last 30 days. A bull market in steel scrap in the past generally had foreshadowed an upturn in steel operations.
Among the beneficiaries of the rise in steel scrap prices will be the railroads. A number of carrier officials have delayed breaking up old cars because the market for scrap was so poor. One Eastern trunk line president recently said that he had postponed junking around 2.000 cars because he could get so little for the scrap. Better prices probably will bring more offerings into the market from the carriers, but some of the railroads undoubtedly will hold for even higher levels.	'

Mayor's Resignation And Unification
Mayor Walker's resignation means a further postponement of progress on transit unification matters. How long the postponement will last depends on the clearing up of the question of whether there will be a mayoralty election this year, or whether Joseph V. McKee, who succeeds Mayor Walker os the city’s chief executive. will hold office until the expiration of the current term. December 31. 1833.
Mr. McKee's activity on transit matters has been confined largely to consideration of the question of unification by the Board of Estimate. He has token a middle course on unification. expressing a willingness to hear all sides of the question, but opposing precipitate action.
Unification must be regarded as the logical solution for the city’s transit problems. The new city subway system now Is ready for opera. . tlon. As a matter of fact, if the city had wanted to put it into operation earlier. It could bavo been done. A« matters now stand, tho Eighth Avenue line Is a white elephant on the city’s hands, which con only be operated at a loss at a 0-cent fare. With tho taxpayers feeling a financial pinch, the city hardly wants to add to its budget items tbo losses on the Eighth Avenue line.
Roan Flgurm Indicate Cash Baying
Action of security loans since July 8, or approximately tbe date Um stock market made its year’s low, gives evidence that buying has, on the whole, been on a cash basis. Brokers* loans in the period have advanced only 8U.000.000. But this increase has been more thllr offset by a *28,000,000 decline in direct security loans extended by New York banks to other than brokers. Taking the member banks In all leading cities, there has been a net decline of *84,-000,000 in total security loans between July 0 and August 24. the latest date available.
Ths continued inflow of gold, pipa the cessation of currency hoarding, is placing banks in an increasingly strong position— Indeed, tbe New York City banks are in an almost impregnable condition. This tai tbe more surprising tn view of tbe fact that since July 20 tbe latter have expanded their total Mans and investments by *208.000.000. In the same period, however, net demand deposits have risen *287,000,000 and
