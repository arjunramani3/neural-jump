A barrage of unpalatable dividend news, including several items that were a distinct shock to Wall Street, brought about a sharp setback. in stock prices yesterday. The market also heard disturbing nows from Germany. The railroad shares continued to do better than the rest of the market, but they could not withstand the general selling which took place in the latter part of thd* session. U. S. Steel preferred lost 4% points. Trading volume picked un on the sell-off.
The bond market withstood selling well for most of the session, but in the late dealings marked irregularity cropped out. Railroad bonds early were in execellent demand, with the highest grade issues touching new tops for the year. Second-grade rail obligations also were in favor early, but reacted later. There were weak spots among industrial bonds, and a break in the German issues unsettled the whole foreign list. Wheat closed fractionally lower. Cotton was heavy from the start, and finished off 11 to 14 points.
The first item the stock market had to contend with was the announcement that the United States Steel preferred dividend had been cut to 50 cents, a much sharper slash than had been anticipated generally. Steel preferred opened at 57*4, on a block of 600 shares, off 4%. The whole market started off weakly, but losses in most issues were not large.
After the first half hour of trading, the rail shares staged a smart uprush, led by Delaware & Hudson, Union Pacific, Atchison and New York Central. Union Pacific sold up to as high as 77%», Delaware & Hudson reached 53’s, Central crossed 20 again, and Atchison got above 46. The industrials did not follow the leadership of the rails, and when the market got another shock, in the shape of the omission of the Standard of Jersey extra payment, followed by a reduction in the Drug, Inc., payment to 75 cents quarterly, from the previous rate of $1. it turned decisively downward, with trading active.
Telephone Weak—r>ivid<*nd action Roon ' Telephone and Consolidated Gas both were weak spots. In view of the earnings decline suffered by both companies, with demand for their services still going off, the possibility of dividend reductions has been well recognized. Telephone directors meet on February 15, while directors of Consolidated Gas now are not scheduled to meet until April.
Tbe break in Standard Oil of New Jersey, in response to the adverse dividend news, was sharp. Just before the announcement the stock sold at 2S%. It broke fast to under 27, rallied, and then slid off again, closing at 25 off 3tr.
The market steadied at the start of the final hour, and the rails started to rally again. They made little progress, and new weakness cropped out in the tobacco stocks. American Tobacco B closed off 3 at 57%. and was not far from the previous bottom on the reaction. Liggett & Myers B and Reynolds were heavy, too. Volume of trading for the day ran to 1,190.000 shares, just short of double the volume on Tuesday. .
Wfiile the immediate dividend news was enough to hurt the market, the word from Germany added to the market's troubles. The dissolution of the Reichstag and the fact that Hitler will be able to rule without parliament, even for a brief period, caused unsettlement. It brought a reaction in stock prices on the Berlin boerse. Another German election is likely in early March.
i	Kastman's Attitude Clarified
I Commissioner Eastman’s comment on the railroad situation shed no new light on the subject, but it made clear his position on matters in which Wall Street is deeply interested. The Commissioner favors additional loans to weak carriers, within certain well-defined limitations. He stressed the importance of passage of the Bankruptcy Bill.
The Stock Exchange’s move, pressing toward fuller information on company affairs and backing up its previous announcement that listing applications filed after July 1. 1933, would have to be certified by independent auditors, is al! to the good. Security holders certainly should have the fullest aid the exchange can give them In the way of protection.
Tbe feature of trading in London was the strength in British funds and the excited speculation in kaffirs. The general industrial stock list was irregular. In Faris, the bourse was mixed.

January definitely saw the beginning of a heavy buying move In the railroad stocks. That buying has been predicated, in large part, on the possibility of a quick comeback in railroad operating Income with an improvement in grass. For many carriers, an increase of 10% in gross revenues, even from the very low levels which prevail currently, would put an entirely different complexion on their net operating income figures. Traffic, in the usual seasonal upswing, by May reaches a point roughly 10% above the average January level.
Commercial Solvents
Stockholders of Commercial Solvents Corp, could read the annual report with some satisfaction. While net income in 1932 was equal to only 50 cents a share, or 10 cents a share less than the current annual dividend requirements, the company’s strong financial position at the end of 1932 is an indication that the current rate cot, be continued for some time, even though business shows no important betterment. Continuance of the current dividend rate only called for a drain of $253,000 on cash in 1932.
The most interesting change revealed by the balance sheet was a large increase in inventories. At the end of last year, they stood at $3,206,463, more than double the figure at the close of the preceding year. Solvents took advantage of low commodity prices last summer to produce a large store of butyl alcohol, which was turned out at very low cost. The expense of laying in this supply caused a reduction in the company’s holdings of cash and Government securities, but cash alone is still more then five times all current liabilities. The inventories are carried on tbe balance sheet at cost, which is considerably less than current market prices.
The Borden Report
Poor business in the late months of 1932. reduced milk prices, and failure of the summer pick-up in demand to come up to expectations, accounted for a slump in Borden’s 1932 earnings. The company was called on to make fairly substantial inroads on its cash to meet dividend disbursements. Dividends paid during the year amounted to $2.50. compared with net earnings equal to $1.70 a share. With 4,396,754 shares of stock out. Borden had to call on surplus to the tune of 53,517,403.
The milk business has run into difficult times. Falling prices have outrun the ability of the leading distributors to effect economies. Until there is price stability, the distributing companies will continue to suffer.
Dividend Reductions
The wave of dividend reductions announced yesterday bad an immediate influence on the course of prices, but the market, generally, held up fairly well. Omission of the Jersey extra brought a rapid decline in the stock, which sold at 28 just before the announcement and sank more than 2 points within a brief period. Drug, Inc., cut its dividend to 75 cents from the previous $1 quarterlj- rate. The market also bad to contend with the drastic slash m the Steel preferred payment.
Those historically inclined, however, recalled that in late 1929, when the long downward movement in the market already had gotten under way. a flood of dividend increases and extras injected momentary bursts of buying in stocks. United States Steel directors voted a $1 extra on October Can directors, on the quarterly rate to $1 Those kindly gestures change, the long-term

The January Market
The high hopes entertained in late December that the market during January would stage a reversal of trend, or break out ot the line formation, were not fulfilled. The stock market last month was distinguished only by a narrowing of the trading range and the lowest volume of trading, on the "Big Board.” since October, 1924. Even in Juno and July of last year trading ran to around 23,000,000 shares a month, while last month it waa only roughly 18,700,000.
While stock movements were narrow during the month, tbe performance of two groups was striking. Railroad shares, throughout the month, showed a tendency to work toward higher levels. Utilities, on the other hand, turned heavy toward the end of the month, under insistent selling.
For both the rails and the industrials, as-measured by the Dow-Jonoa averager, the close on January 3, the first trading sosslon of the month, was the montb's low. The industrials closed at 50.29 and the Tall average at 25.59. The month’s high for the industrials was 64.35, and for tho rails 29.52. For the bulk of the month, however, the industrials swung between
