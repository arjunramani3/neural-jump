Stocks extended their declines of the past two weeks amid growing fears that the global economic slowdown could last longer than expected.
After sliding 5% last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 223.73 points, or 2.6%, at 8273.58. The blue-chip average is less than 100 points above its Oct. 27 bearmarket low and off 37.6% this year.
Major stock indexes opened lower and seesawed through much of the afternoon, until a late wave of selling sent them near their midmorning lows at the closing bell. "We're expecting this bear market to last well into next year," said David James, senior vice president and portfolio manager at James Investment Research in Alpha, Ohio.
"The long term doesn't look good at all."
The financial sector was the most consistent laggard as major Wall Street firms slashed jobs and bonuses, but the losses broadened at day's end. Weak profits at major retailers and new data confirming a recession in Japan added to the worries investors have harbored in recent months.
Alcoa fell most among Dow components, dropping 10.8% after UBS analysts cut their rating to "neutral" from "buy."
The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 2.6% to 850.75. Its financial sector posted the biggest decline, down 6.9% to a new closing low.
Among retailers, Target fell 4.1% after it reported a 24% drop in third-quarter profit.
Oil futures fell to their lowest since January 2007, down 3.7% at $54.95 a barrel in New York. Treasury prices rose. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 4.204%. Credit: By Peter A. McKay
