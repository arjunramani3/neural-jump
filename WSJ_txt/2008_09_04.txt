Alpha Natural Resources, a coal company, down 20% this week, and Petrohawk Energy, off by 19% this week, are part of a group of 50 stocks identified by Goldman Sachs that "matter most" to hedge funds, because they are the top holdings in a number of funds.

Downbeat employment figures, disappointing retail sales data and growing speculation about troubles at major hedge funds conspired to send stocks tumbling to their worst loss in more than two months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 344.65 points, or 3%, to 11188.23, its lowest close since July 28. The declines were led by a 7.2% slide in Bank of America. Of 30 Dow components, Coca-Cola was the only stock to rise, up 0.1%.
Trading volume was heavy and about five times as many New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks declined as advanced.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 38.15 points, or 3%, to 1236.83. All its sectors slid, led by financials, off 4.9%, and the economically sensitive basic-materials category and technology, each off 3.6%.
"Hedge funds are de-leveraging, mutual funds have redemptions so are reducing positions and there aren't a lot of buyers with conviction," said Todd Steinberg, head of equities for the Americas at BNP Paribas.
Some fear investor jitters will grow in the weeks ahead, as a number of hedge funds deal with substantial losses and sell stock. Some funds are selling because they are nervous that their investors might pull out, forcing them to come up with cash to meet withdrawals. Others are trying to get out of stock positions ahead of some of their rivals, or are trying to make money shorting stocks held by struggling hedge funds.
Speculation swept the market that $13 billion New York hedge fund Atticus Capital was liquidating its positions and closing down, but executives of the firm denied the chatter. Atticus says its investors are largely sticking with it, despite losses in its two main hedge funds this year.
Some stocks that Atticus has held in recent months were clobbered Thursday, including Burlington Northern Santa Fe, down 3.7%, Union Pacific, down 6%, and MasterCard, down 5.9%.
Part of the nervousness about hedge funds stems from a decision this week by Ospraie Management, one of the biggest players in commodities, to close its largest fund after substantial losses.
"Macro people are shorting the market, thinking more hedge-fund liquidation is to come and they're just playing the disarray in the hedge-fund community," said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Fla.
Alpha Natural Resources, a coal company, down 20% this week, and Petrohawk Energy, off by 19% this week, are part of a group of 50 stocks identified by Goldman Sachs that "matter most" to hedge funds, because they are the top holdings in a number of funds. That group is down 6.7% this week, compared with the 3.6% decline in the S&P 500.
As the stock market lost ground, the dollar rocketed higher versus the euro after European officials acknowledged growing risks to the region's economic growth. By late afternoon in New York, the dollar had gained 1.28% against the euro, leaving it up almost 2% since the start of the year.
Troubling data on employment also tripped up investors a day before the government's monthly data on nonfarm payrolls are due for release Friday. The Labor Department reported new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, increasing concern that the report for August will be worse than expected.
