By Robert OBrien /Aw Jernes !^nrsuin,s
NEW YORK - Blue-chip stocks soared amid a powerful bond rally in the wake of fresh evidence that inflation remains in check.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average waged its best campaign since its 257-point advance on Sept. 2. gaining 174.78 points, or 2.267,, to 7895.92. It was only a late retreat from the session's highs that prevented the average from closing above 7900 points for the first time since Aug. 20.
Shares of Procter It Gamble, one of several multinational companies that have been hit by earnings worries since early August, jumped 744 to 142’/., its highest finish since Aug. 14.
Also getting a btg lift were interest-sensitive blue-chip stocks, such as Citicorp, which gained 3 15/16 to 131 7/16, as the group rose on a sharp improvement In the Interest-rate backdrop. The bellwether 30year Treasury bond jumped more than two points tn the session, driving its yield down to 6.403%, after a report that the August consumer price Index climbed just 0.2%.
Analysts said eamlngs, or at least the outlook for earnings, played a crucial role In yesterday’s stock-market performance. After selling shares of consumer stocks since mid August, when Coca-Cola and Gillette said third-quarter earnings wouldn't meet Wall Street's forecasts, investors seemed to be more comfortable about the profit picture, analysts said.
Of course, there were some casualties, including Eastman Kodak. The company preannounced an eamlngs shortfall In a forecast late Monday. The stock closed yesterday at 57. down 814, or 13%, In the past two trading sessions.
But Gillette managed an upswing, gain-Ing3 ll/16to83N;Coca-Colaaddedl 11/16 to 59'4, and McDonald's advanced 15/16 to 47. All three had swooned earlier this month on eamlngs worries.
Drug stocks hadn't been popular for most of the month until yesterday. Bristol-Myers Squlbb climbed 3 3/16 to 8144, Its best finish since July 25.
Ell Lilly gained 2 1/16 to 113 7/16, its highest close since the Dow industrials peaked In early August. Merck rose 3 to 96 11/16, Warner-Lambert gained 2 3/16 to 137. and Pfizer rose 2 to 60 1/16.
Oil-drilling stocks plunged, paced by Diamond Offshore Drilling, which fell 3% to 55'v on heavy volume. Loews agreed to sell $1 billion of 3.125% exchangeable subordinated notes due Sept. 15 , 2007, which are convertible Into Diamond common shares at 665.04 a Diamond share any time after Oct. 1, 1998. Loews said it owns 70.1 million shares, or 50.3%, of Diamond's common stock outstanding, including the about 15.4 million shares convertible from the note sale.
Weak eamlngs forecasts hurt some stocks. Polaroid dropped 3 5/16 to 52. The company said a strong U.S. dollar will hurt its third-quarter profit. American Pad & Paper, Illustrating the hazards of a disappointing profit forecast, plunged 10 1/16 to 14 >4.
Microsoft (Nasdaq), dogged Monday by eamlngs worries and fears that product Introductions have been delayed, recovered most of its losses yesterday, jumping 5 11/16 to 136*4.
Ascend Communications had faced the same problem. Shares climbed 13/16 to 3311/16, erasing some of the previous session's losses.
Meanwhile, computer stocks were above-trend performers. Dell Computer surged 5 to 92V outstripping the 52-week high set Sept. 9. Compaq Computer jumped

5 1/16 to 6944 and reached a 52-week high intraday. International Business Machines added 3*4 to 99%. Even Gateway 2000, which has been hampered by an early September negative eamlngs forecast, managed to gain 11/16 to 32'4.
Other high-tech bellwethers strung together positive sessions. Intel (Nasdaq) rose 3*4 to 9513/16 and Texas Instruments shot up 5 3/16 to 1315/16, setting its first 52-week high In more than a month.
One of the most impressive performances In the session was turned In by the securities group: Wall Street, In effect, led Its own market higher. Again, eamlngs excitement was the catalyst.
Goldman Sachs posted pretax profit showing a 58% Improvement over a year earlier. A private partnership, there are no public shares of Goldman, and thus no eamlngs forecasts. But the Improvement In profit bodes well for the rest of Wall Street's publicly held securities brokers.
Merrill Lynch, for example, added 344 to 68'4. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover gained 344 to 5444, a 52-week high. Salomon climbed 4'4 to 65*4. Lehman Brothen rose 1*4 to 47 3/16. Travelen Group added 3’4 to 70 3/16.
Banks staged a sharp advance on the improvement In the Interest-rate backdrop. The Philadelphia Stock Ex-change/Keefe Bruyette & Woods banking index rose 19.62, or 2.84%, to 709.99 for the session, as stocks like Chase Manhattan, up 3 l/16to 115 9/16; BankBoston,up2l4 to 88’4; and BankAmerlca, up 21/16 to 74 5/16; all rose sharply.
The stock market's technical performance was a marvel as well. Advancing issues had a 3-to-l advantage over decliners, 2,225 to 753, respectively.
Trading was brisk, as 635.8 million shares changed hands, well ahead of Monday's 467.5 million shares. The trading level was the highest since 646 million shares traded on July 16 amid that month's eamlngs-driven rally.
Other major market indicators staged big rallies. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index shot up 25.87, or 2.81%, to 945.64. The Nasdaq Composite Index Jumped 33.68, or 2.06%, to 1668.60, Its first record since Sept. 9.
The Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks continued smashing records, advancing 5.01, or 1.14%, to 445.18. The American Stock Exchange Composite Index, another small-cap-stock Indicator, moved up 5.39, or 0.8%, to 680.05.
Certainly, not every market watcher was convinced that the worst was over for blue-chip stocks. A.C. Moore, chief Investment strategist at Principal Financial, told Dow Jones: “1 think the era of really positive surprises is probably over for now. We're moving In a much more competitive time. One of the key places you're going to see pressure is on multinationals." He also said the era of big new products may be over for high-technology companies, just as they are finding themselves forced to cut prices on existing inventories.
