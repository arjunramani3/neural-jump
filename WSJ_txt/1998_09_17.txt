NEW YORK-Small-capitallzation and Nasdaq stocks were sharply lower yesterday, reflecting the severe selling pressure that gripped the entire stock market.
In a shift from their typical dynamic, the losses incurred by the small-cap market, as measured by the Russell 2000 Index, were less sharp than the overall Nasdaq market, the broad market and blue-chip stocks. It is important to remember, however, that the small-cap market began falling from Its highs months before the broader market began its sell-off, and that the small-cap market's overall losses have been significantly worse than those of the rest of the stock market.
Yesterday’s declines ended the four-session winning streaks of the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq market.
The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks fell 4.56, or 1.27%, to 355.29, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, at 1646.25, plummeted 43.66, or 2.58%.
A.C. Moore Arts & Crafts plummeted 314, or 34%, to 604 after the Blackwood, N.J., operator of arts-and-crafts superstores said It expects to report a loss for the third quarter, short of analysts’ "small profit” projections. The company said the lack of rain in the Northeast hurt its third-quarter sales because arts and crafts are "primarily an indoor activity."
J.B. Hunt Transport Services dropped 5%, or 26%, to 1614 after the Lowell, Ark., trucking company said its third-quarter earnings will be below analysts’ expectations even though they will show a "substantial” improvement over its year-ear-liet profit. The company said a 7.5% reduction in container/trailer fleet utilization lowered earnings by about 10 cents to 15 cents a share.
Primus Telecommunications Group plunged 19/16, or 19%, to 614. The McLean, Va., long-distance telephone company said it will delay significant capital investments in Japan until the second half of 1999 and investments in Latin America until 2000, in response to market conditions there. The company expects the instability in foreign markets will produce constraints in the near term on accessing public debt and equity markets. Legg Mason and BT Alex. Brown both lowered their ratings on Primus.
AirTran Holdings, the Atlanta holding company that runs AirTran, the airline formed by the merger of ValuJet with AirTran Airways, slid 11/32, or 19%, to 4 13/32. The company said its opportunity for a profitable third quarter has been "destroyed” by what it called predatory pricing practices by its competitors. AirTran alleges that the Department of Transportation is refusing to Investigate the air-fare pricing practices of the major carriers.
Imperial Bancorp (NYSE) tumbled 256, or 16%, to 13 3/16. Jefferies & Co. lowered its rating on the Los Angeles finance company to "hold” from "accumulate.”
Odwalla slipped 1%, or 15%, to 9. Hambrecht & Quist lowered its rating on the Half Moon Bay, Calif., juice and beverage company to “hold" from “buy,” citing unfavorable pricing trends for orange products and strawberries, key ingredients in the company’s juices and smoothies.
8x8, a Santa Clara, Calif., developer of video-compression semiconductors and related software, surged %, or 37%, to 3 7/32. The company said its ViaTV Videophones will be sold in Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club stores. The company also said It is beginning a $3 million advertising campaign for the ViaTV Videophone.
Diedrich Coffee jumped %, or 18%, to 5%. The Irvine, Calif., coffee roaster and retailer signed a development agreement with Coffee Housepitality LLC to open 44
coffeehouses and an undisclosed number of carts and kiosks in North Carolina over the next five years.
QuesTech, a Falls Church, Va., information-technology company, gained 1 13/16, or 12%, to 171/16. QuesTech and CACI International agreed on a final price of $18,13 a share for CACI’s acquisition of QuesTech.
Apex Mortgage Capital (NYSE) was up 13/16, or 8.9%, to 915/16. The Los Angeles mortgage real-estate investment trust said its third-quarter earnings will exceed that attained in the two previous quarters. Apex said its board approved the repurchase of as many as 750,000 shares, which would be in addition to the 750,000 it bought back since January.
Anlka Therapeutics added %, or 5.7%, to 13%. The Woburn, Mass., drug developer said a preclinical study found its hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides drug inhibited the spread of cancer cells in animals. Anlka also said it will seek a strategic partner to assist in the future development and commercialization of the drug’s technology.
Citizens First Financial (AMEX) rose 94, or 5.4%, to 1494. The Normal, Ill., savings bank said it will repurchase 120,449 common shares outstanding, or 5% of its common stock. Prior to the new program, the company repurchased 408,529 common shares at an average price of $16.24.
"Small caps are really suffering from a lack of confidence," said Jack White, director of research at Interstate/Johnson Lane. "They need a sign that we’re not looking at a worse-case economic scenario before moving."
On Nasdaq, declining issues led advancers, 2,663 to 1,295, on national market volume of 649 million shares and overall volume of 683 million, compared with 680 million and 716 million, respectively, Wednesday.
