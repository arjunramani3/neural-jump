SOUTH KOREAN troops recaptured a key airport after U- S. B-29 bomber raids.
It is Kimpo Airport 16 air miles northwest of the fallen South Korean capital of Seoul. The main force of the South Koreans, meanwhile. appeared to have stabilized its central front on the Han River just south, of Seoul These developments were reported by Gen. MacArthur’s headquarters shortly after the general himself returned to Tokyo after a daring flight to the front. A North Korean plane had tried to attack MacArthur’s unarmed personal aircraft the “Bataan.” It was dri~cn off by a U. S^fighter.	s
IT. S. airmen flew yesterday in 1SS jor-iter against the enemy.yGcn. MacArthur said 12 North Korean planes, have been shot down along with five probabies and three damaged since the. invaders struck Sunday. No U. S. planes have been downed, but some have been destroyed on the ground.	-
Russia declared that responsibility for tbe Korean war lies with South. Korea and "those who stand behind them.” The statement was issued in-Moscow in reply to a U. S. note ask-
Korean fighting. Both Russia and the North Koreans announced yesterday that V. S. B-29s had attacked Pyongyang. the North Korean capital. This was denied indirectly by Air Force spokesmen. They said U. S. operations have been confined south of the 38th parallel which separates North and South Korea.
CHINA’S REDS broadcast a decision “to liberate Formosa from the U. S. aggressors." The Communist Government-Council voted unanimously “to unite and fight to the last" to gain control of tills island stronghold of the Chinese Nationalists. Foreign Minister Chou En-lai excoriated the U. S. for what he called "armed aggression against the territory of China." He declared that "no matter what obstructive action' the V. SI imperialists will take, the fact that Formosa is. part of China will remain unchanged forever"- according- -q the broadcast picked up in Tokyo.
Presumably the "obstructive action” would be naval action by.the U. S. 7th . Fleet, which Truman has ordered to "prerent any attack on Forrriosa.” But the Chinese reds gave no hint of when, they would make their "liberation” attempt. !
