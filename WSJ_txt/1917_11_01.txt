Sales. 1.44-4.000 shares.
Liquidation of a most alarming; kind set in anew and prices tumbled to levels which made the panic prices of 1907 look high. It was an enormous market which moved in large fractions and full points. The market showed the cumulative effect of months of slow liquidation. It was a crash in the full sense of the word and yet the decline was orderly every minute of the day. Brokers with 30 or more years of experience in Wall Street insisted that they had never seen such a market in their experience.	_
Obviously the decline has reached a point where it is hurting rich men. The highest class of investment stock yielded most to the pressure. The decline of United States Steel common to the lowest point of the year wa* not as a’arming as the intense depression of Southern Pacific, Atchison. Union Pacific and Reading. New low records were made in nearly all parts of the list. Resourceful-
ness of a few pools operating in shipping and malt stocks was a saving grace.	;
Prices no longer represent values. They only show a trend and the argument that stocks are selling way be- ; low their intrinsic values has lost its force.	:
We are paying for three years of speculation. The • events of the last few weeks in the war zones show that1 the war is* far from ended. There were many big men in Wall Street six months ago who believed that the war would be over by this time. They have changed their j method of reasoning. Perhaps these are the men who ar** now selling securities which have been locked up for ; generations. It is now stated in well informed circles that ; the war will only start in earnest next spring. Some es- I timates of the length run in excess of ten years. The evi- J dence against German barbarism that has been collected • in Washington will probably come out in the near future. It will emphasize the fart that this war is not only a war for dcmocarcy but a war for human existence. This country will yet be inflamed to the same extent that France and England have become inflamed, and then only will the struggle be on in full blast.	.	__ __
A longer war will necessitate another readjustment in the security market. Billions must be raised, perhaps as much as twenty billions next year. The competition for money will become more intense every month. Left to Itself' the competitive market will straggle for its ex-istance. Government aid will certainly be asked if the slump is carried much further. The Chamber of Commerce of N. Y. has just passed resolutions urging the Interstate Commerce Commission to come to the aid of the eastern railroads. The Chamber not only asks for increased rates to cover the high transportation cost* but include-. In its request a demand for sufficient income to cover al?»a tho highe? cost of capital. A railroad which is compelled to pay IO**? for its money ought to get a square ^deal from a Government which gets its money for 4^7 . Wall Street would like to sec the Interstate Commerce Commission move a* fast as <ecuritv value* arc moving downtvar-Tho rnmmi^sion has moxed at a snail’s pace to date. _t is high time for an awakening.

Buving of Put* on Stocks
Big trader* xvho are restrained from short selling and who beliexe that the market will go much lower are buying puts on stocks. There is reason for encouraging this practice. When n stock goes below the put price the holder of a put becomes a prospective purchaser. His commitments in puts, therefore."bring a new stabilizing influence into the market.
Indiscriminate Adx-icc to Sell Short
Indi*crirfiinato advices have been sent all over the country to sell Steel common *;hort. The Stock Exchange authorities arc already cognizant of the source of these advices. Telegrams and letters xvere sent m the face of the general knowledge that the exchange was trying to ctiru sho't selling. It is verv probable that tlie severe break in Steel to 96 in the second hour, repicsenting a net loss of 4 9* for the day, was due principally to the scajc-head instructions to an army of large and small investors.
Steel Corporation Buying Its Bonds
Wai! Street xxmnts to know whrit the Steel Corporation is doing with all its money. It xvould like to know xvnether its purchases of Liberty bonds xvere made in cash or xvith foreign money. One source of expenditure, it can be stated, was for the corporation*.* own sinking fund bonds. It is understood that §14.000,000 of these bonds have been purchased in the open market from 106 down to 99. This represents a good investment and also explains xvhy these bonds had been holding up higher than other 5% industrial bonds of similar character. The sinking fund provides for the retirement each year of §1,000,000 bonds at 110. These are called by lottery and the purchase of additional bonds does not abrogate the cnlling of a million a year. If the Steel Corporation should buy $50,000,000 of the sinking fund bonds on an average of par it would save 10 points or $5,000,000.
Crucible Steel Weak
The report of the Crucible Steel Co. wae disappointing and the stoctc sold off 39A to 57^6. Pittsburgh advices had created the impression that Crucible was earning $2,000,000 a month. The annual report does not show clearly whether taxes xvere subtracted from the net of about $12,000,000. Quarterly report of the New Jersey Zinc Co. wag another discouraging feature.
' Lowest Brices at Close
’x>west prices of the day xvere made in the last Sour. Ster common sold at 94% for a net loss of 0 points. This los' was more pronounced than any made in the turbulent markets of last February and December. New low record* were also made in the last half hour in Reading, Anaconda, Midvale and American Sugar common. New York Air Brake sold off 11 points to 100. Even Marine preferred, the bulwark of the day, lost 4 points from its high.
A few strong spots xxcrc found in the motor group, in Canadian Pacific and Interborough Consolidated preferred.
Reports were heard that large Canadian accounts held in New York commission houses had been liquidated dur-(^ing the das’.
