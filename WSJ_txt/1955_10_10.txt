Abreast of the Market
Stocks Tumble 3rd Monday in Row
Industrials Off 13.27, Rails 4.63
For the third Monday in a row prices nose dived on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Volume of trading again expanded sharply while prices were falling* and for 20 minutes around the middle of the day the stock ticker lagged as much as three minutes behind in its reports of individual transactions taking place on the floor of the exchange. However, after that period the ticker caught up and remained abreast of trading for the rest of the day, even when quotations slid off further during the afternoon.
Yesterday’s declines reached one to (our points in Individual stocks. In the Dow Jones industrial average the drop amounted to 13.27 points, or 2.92%. It was greater than (he 10.92-point break of Monday* October 3, but still a lot smaller than the 31.89-polnt crash of September 26. In the railroad average, off 4.63. the percentage decline was about the same as in the industrials, being 3.06% but in the utilities it was much less at 1.39%
From their recent highs, the industrials and rails also have fallen about the same percentage—rospectively, 9.5% and 10.9% The! industrials’ decline in points is 46.31 horn its' top, reached September 23, while the rails are off 17.92 from their recent peak, reached September 16. The utilities touched their high back in July.
In all three averages, it is necessary to go back several months to find levels as low as those at the close yesterday. The industrials are now at the lowest level since the June 14 close of 438.20, the rails at their lowest since March 22 and the utilities since December 2S. 1954.
While brokers reported some buying yesterday by people who had placed orders on r descending price scale, with private investors and institutions both in the market, purchasing was not aggressive. The selling seemed to come in large purl from investors salvaging some of the profits they had accumulated m the last couple of years. Many orders placed tor exactly that purpose, to sell stocks i! they fell below specified prices, were touched off A natural result ot thsec profit-taking sales is that customers' cash balances m many brokerage houses have increased sharniv.
Heavy selling of copper shares was noted. This weakness was accelerated by th»- three successive reductions in prices of the meta! I last week. Anaconda was the most n.-t:v.- issue j Thompson Products— and at one time was more than 2<» poiuts under . the 1955 high ot 83.	i
Phillips Petroleum was active and weak. Traders had been talking of o split or an increased dividend, and declaration of onlv the regular dividend was a distinct disappointment to short term traders who had bought the stock.
General Electric was showing leststance to the selling and brokers reported investment buying in this issue on weakness. Westtrghnusc ' Electric sold at new lows.
Aircraft shares were firmer than the re.< the market, particularly Glenn L. Matin: .mb United Aircraft.
U. S. Steel made a strong snow of resist.i:: •< at 55 in the forenoon, but heavy sellmg imm took it down below 51. Bethlehem wa> urn active, but it suffered a sharp sinking spell during the day. when it was off some tmir points. Leading automotive stocks were unde: pressure.
Utilities were mostly lower, but Ameri- an j Gas & Electric enjoyed some investment support. Natural gas stocks also met buying on declines, but like the majority of issues were off on the day.	j
There was foreign selling in Royal Dutch and the stock dipped below the weak opening price on September 26. when n was off m ' points at 76.	'
Railroads were not active, but thin mark-’is were noted in sonic of these issues, including Rock Island. Atchison and Southern Raiiw.iv DuPont was weak after the announcement that the Supreme Court would review dismissal of the Government's civil antitrust suit against the company and General Motors. International Paper was a firmer stock, with the Street talking of possible higher prices.
Prices were also lower and trading on the American Slock Exchange. I’. S. Foil j B was off 13 at 207 and Pittsburgh * Lake Erie off 3\ at 100. Woodley Petroleum and international Petroleum were active and lower.

Calaveras Cement—	'
A record year for both sales and earnings seems assured for Calaveras Cement Co. (San Francisco) although bad weather in November and December could lower present estimates. Net sales now are expected to be in the neighborhood of $10 million and net profit over $1 million, or better than $2.65 a share. Last year sales set a record at $8,649,972. on which $836.088. or $2.21 a share, was earned.- The previous record net was $950,649 in 1953. Since the firm | has been producing at about capacity all year, land selling all it could produce, the "normal" seasonal pattern of better second half showings resulting mostly from higher sales during the summer season is not likely to occur. High sales during the second quarter depleted invcnloiic.. making any notable htrrcnse In sales for the third quarter very unlikely.
Thus, sales for the year should be roughly double the $5,082,539 reported for the first half, but errnngs are not expected to reach twice the $672,268, or $1.77 per share reported for the same period. Ono factor affecting earnings is a -f't wage increase effective May 1 winch will ho tn effect in all the second half against two nionUis m (he first. Depreciation charges, which lust year were $901,277, amounting to $2.38 a share, will be about Ute same this year. The company’s active expansion program anounts for the high rate of amortization. Calaveras is currently embarking on a .$1 million expansion which by completion neat the end o: 1956 will boost capacity lo 4,500,000 barrels annually from 3.250,000 barrels presently. By that lime, the company | expects that increased capacity of most manu-| facturers will have brought return of a nor-| mal. highly competitive market.
j Net of Thompson Products. Inc., this year is expected to drop below the record $11,678,645, equal to $4.25 on each of 2.663,322 common shares outstanding, eurned ir 1954. Though it s too early to pinpoint final rcsults, they should easily be the second best on record, exceeding the $9,652,923, or $3.56 a share, recorded m 1952. the previous second host year. For the first six months this year, , the company earned at a record rale, netting $6,768.119, or 52.42 on each of the 2,721,940 common shares now outstanding. J. H. Coolidge, vice president, indicates, however, second half profits will fall short of those for Hie first six months because of model changeovers m the automotive industry and shifting aircraft engine production schedules under the defense program. Thompson is a major supplier of parts for the automotive and aircraft industries.
The firm's sales this year will exceed 1951 , volume of $268,980,897. thus outstrip, ing by a l considerable margin company estimates made i early in the year of a volume around $250 ' million tor 1955. Sales, however, will be below ' the record high of $326 million, in that j year, volume was swelled by peak post-'Korean war aircraft production. Shipments of products to automotive manufacturers arc expeeled to set a record high in 1955, according tu Mr. Coolidge, with the ago more than offsetting j cl me m j auto purls j expected to
gain over a year an anticipated deaircraft parts sales. Shipments of for the replacement market arc be about the same as a year
ago.

Despite the St million which has been spent.in the last nine years for new and improved manufacturing facilities, additional capital expenditures for machinery and equipment are planned to meet increased demand and reduce costs. During the next six months, the company expects to spend between $-100,000 and $600,000 on expansion. The funds for the expansion and additional working capital are being provided through a 5 year term loan of $600,000 which has just been negotiated with bankers.
