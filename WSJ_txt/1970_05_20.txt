Abreast of the Market
Stocks Plunge to 7-Year Lows; Industrials Fall 14.85 Points as Trading Pace Picks Up Sharply
By David McLean
Stock pnces declined sharply along a broad front yesterday in heavier trading as the market fell to seven-year lows.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.85 points to 676-55 cutting through the old 1970 and seven-year low of 684.79 of last Thursday. The industrial average was lower on March 15, 1963, when it closed at 676.33.
Yesterday's volume, picking up from its sluggish pace of the past few weeks, totaled 13,020,000 shares, a big jump from Tuesday's 9.480.000. Declines overwhelmed advances— 1,258 to 160.
Other Indicators Fall
The Dow Jones transportation and utility averages also broke into new low ground. The transportation indicator finished with a 3.73 loss to 142.30. its lowest close since Jan. 2, 1963. when it was at 142.03. The utility average yesterday sank 1.60 to 101.51. its lowest since Jan. 8. 1961. when It was 101.40.
“It was another bad day at Black Rock," commented one analyst.
Continuing worry about a host of situations -Cambodia, the economy, inflation, domestic unrest. Federal budget deficits-weighed on the market, an analyst said. “Confidence is the key word,” he remarked. “There’s a lack of confidence in the future of the economy and of the conduct of the Government. There are good values here, but nobody’s buying and they just keep going down.”
“The selling breeds more selling,” another analyst said. A continuing negative factor in the market was margin calls, he said. Investors were selling stock to raise cash to keep equity in their credit accounts at brokers above a minimum standard.
Prices’ sagged from the opening bell, with the industrial average sliding 6.71 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. There was some firming in mid-morning, but it lacked force and the steady erosion set in again by noon.
Shortly before 2 p.m., the Labor Department announced consumer prices rose at a 7.2% annual pace in April, exceeding March’s 6% rate. The sharp increase was viewed as a setback to Government economists who have been predicting a slowing in the rate of price rises. The report accelerated the stock-price decline, a broker said.
The drop snipped 0.38 from the American Stock Exchange index with the average closing at 20.53, its lowest close since July 7, 1967, when it was at 20.51. Volume advanced to 3,820,000 shares from 2,410,000 in the previous session. Declines led gains by a better than seven-to-one margin.
Two New Highs
Two stocks managed to set new 1970 highs, but 617 issues hit lows for the year. On Tuesday, one stock reached a high for the year while 289 slumped to new lows.
Block activity, a measure of institutional activity in the market, picked up. There were 83 trades of 10,000 shares or more, up from 56 Tuesday.	,
Electric & Musical Industries Ltd., a London-based manufacturer of phonograph records and electronic equipment, headed the volume list, its final turnover of 912,900 swelled by blocks of 613,200, 100,000, 94,000, 40,000 and 35,000, all handled for institutions by Eastman Dillon. It closed at 4, off %. The company has a contract with the Beatles, the singing group, on an individual or collective basis, one analyst said. The group recently announced they are disbanding. Electric & Musical also controls Capitol Industries, manufacturer of Capitol Records. Capitol closed off 1% to 25% on the American exchange.
American Airlines had a block of 175,100 handled on both sides by Goldman-Sachs, and the issued closed off 2 to 22% on volume of 220,900. The airline reported an April loss
