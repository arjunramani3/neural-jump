Industrials Surge by Record 35^34 as .Stocks Rebound In Busy Session in Response to .Moves to Boost Dollar
By Victor J. hillbry
After one tit its biggest collapses in history. the stock market yesterday exploded with surging volume across a broad front in response to Washington's moves to bolster the sagging dollar.
The Dow Jones industrial average skyrocketed 35.34 points to 827.79, exceeding its previous single-session record of 32.93 points on Aug. 16,1971. after President Nixon's announcement of wage and price controls. In the 12 sessions prior to yesterday's move the index sustained a net drop of 104.64 points.
Underscoring the wide sweep of the recovery were the 1,506 New York Stock Exchange issues that gained, more than six times the 235 losers.
The market’s rebound came after the Federal Reserve Board announced an increase to 9%% from 8H% in the discount rate it charges on loans to member banks, establishment of a supplementary reserve requirement equal to 2% on large certificates of deposit and increases in the Fed's swap arrangements with the central banks of Germany, Japan and Switzerland. “Change in Psychology”
“The measures indicate the administration finally means business about defending the dollar and also means business about beating inflation even if it requires the economy to go into a recessionary phase," asserted Newton D. Zinder, vice president of E.F. Hutton & Co. “Among investors there's been a complete change in psychology.”
“The upshot of this has been a dramatic rally in the dollar and a precipitous decline in the price of gold" and “this response has been long overdue," commented Hany A. Jacobs Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Bache. Halsey, Stuart Shields Inc. "The implication of all this is that the administration has made the political decision to court a recession in order to support the dollar. This is the hardball reaction which the foreign speculator had been demanding."
Big Board volume, including 23,910,000 shares traded in the first two hours, swelled to 50,450,000 shares, the seventh highest on record and up from 42,720,000 Tuesday.
Part of yesterday’s buying wave was attributed to short covering, or the purchasing of shares to replace borrowed stock that had been sold earlier.
“in recent weeks, the market has experienced one of its most severe declines over a short period of time in the post-war period," said Richard McCabe, analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. “The decline had apparently been catalyzed by the fears of a continued rise in inflation and interest rates if the economy remained strong, weakness in the dollar in foreign exchange markets which has discouraged for eign buying of U.S. stocks and by the correction of the secondary stock-margin debt up-cycle of recent years."
He added that “we would expect this initial rebound from the extreme oversold condition to be followed by further testing or consolidation later in November before a sustainable new advance develops."
The recent period was “the most oversold two-week period in stock market history," contended Ralph Bloch, vice president of Moseley, Hallgarten & Estabrook Inc.
The market's recent precipitous drop apparently was necessary to move Washington to take firm action, said Thomas S. Darnall Jr., senior vice president of St. Louis Union Trust Co. "It was applying the two-by-four method. You first get the mule's attention by hitting him between the eyes with a two-by-four." Record Gains
Record gains also were made yesterday by the New York Stock Exchange composite index which spurted 2.12 points and by the American Stock Exchange indicator which climbed 6.67 to 143.42. Big advances also were shown by the Dow Jones transportation average, up 10.32 points to 219.03 and the utility index, up 1.25 to 98.58.
Greater institutional activity was reflected in the 547 trades of 10,000 shares or more, up from 410 Tuesday.
Part of yesterday's strength also was ascribed to foreign buying but "the full impact of foreign purchases probably won't be felt until (today) because many of Europe's investors were out of the market on Wednesday observing the religious holiday,” said
Larry Wachtel, first vice president at Bache.
Yesterday the market climbed for the first 90 minutes, and then hesitated a bit until mid-afternoon. Brokers suggested that this pause probably reflected selling by specialists, who are charged with keeping orderly markets on the floors of the exchanges, and by big block-trading houses. The specialists and block-trading houses reportedly had a big pile up of inventories during the market's recent collapse.
“There isn't any question that the Fed's recent action will slow the growth of business activity, but, what the market seems to be saying is that it's prepared to meet that, rather than face double-digit inflation in 1979," said Richard McFarland, president of Dain, Kalfoan & Quail Inc.
With the “tremendous amount of institutional cash on the sidelines, we are very optimistic about the outstanding values" in the market, particularly about companies whose recent earnings have risen 50% to 100% but whose stocks have dropped about 30% to 50%. he added.	i
Townsend Brown II, senior vice president of U.S. Trust Co., contended that "the administration's anti-inflation program of voluntary wage and price'controls just won't work and the next step will be mandatory controls.” The reason, he said, is that “if the Fed cracks down hard enough to really squelch inflation it would put us in ar recession and that would be an unpalatable platform on which to run for reelection."
Therefore, he thinks “it's vital to examine every security to see whether it would

be on the hit list with any program of mandatory wage and price controls."
“Expectations of future inflation won't decline until there is a clear trend toward more conservative monetary policy and a slowing of growth in government spending,” contended Ben. E. Laden, chief economist at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.
Bernard Rosenbaum, a senior trader at Neuberger & Berman, believes “people should be selling into this rally to accumulate buying power.”
Bond prices rallied strongly. Prime corporates were up about 1% points and longterm governments as much as two points in over-the-counter trading.
A 3.53-point gain was shown by the National Association of Securities Dealers' Nasdaq composite index of OTC stocks; it ended at 114.65.
