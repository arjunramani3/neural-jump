‘	A GENERAL ADVANCE
After early hesitation market advajjced briskly under leaitership of Steel, which rallied. from 38 to 40.	*
Sales 384.040 shares
The action of United States Steel was the dominating Influence in the stock market yesterday. For some time after the opening there was uncertainty as to whether the new official minimum of 38 was sufficiently low to restore Bteel permanently to active trading, and the traders, who were bearishly inclined, endeavored to force the general market down in the hope of making that issue once more unsaleable. The bearish operations produced a fairly sharp reaction in the general list; but they also demonstrated that there was a good demand for Steel, and when this
fact was ascertained* the traders endeavored to cover their shorts* with the result that a good rally ensued. United States Steel was the leader of the recovery and its price before the close reached 40, which was the official minimum at the end of last week. At the day’s low point Steel showed a decline of over 13 points from the level at the close on Tuesday of last week, when the direcors* meeting was convened to reveive the quarterly report and act upon the dividend question. That decline was probably sufficient to reflect the unfavorable trade conditions and the passing of the dividend, so that a recovery was due on general -principles, -without the aid of such improbable stories as were circulated in the course of the day to explain the strength of the stock.
Apart from the recovery" in the price of United States Steel, the news of the day contained much that was favorable. The offering of $49,000,000 Pennsylvania Kailroad bonds, the largest issue since the outbreak of the war, was heavily over-subscribed, the price of copper was advanced to 14% cents, the Homestead Works of the Carnegie Co. resumed after a long shut down, the Chicago & North Western placed an order for 27,000 tons of rails, and there was a reappearance of foreign buying in the grain and cotton markets. The day’s exports of cotton amounted to almost 130,000 bales, the largest of the season, and close to the highest ever reported in the history of American commerce; and wheat, due to the influence of foreign buying reached new high record prices. The increased exports of cotton, and the continued large export movement in wheat at the high prices now prevailing, give promise of an even larger excess of exports over imports than was reported for December, when the balance of trade in favor of the United States amounted to almost $132,000,000.
Transactions totaled 285,000 shares, and at the end advances were general.
Active and firm
At the opening the market was moderately active and firm, although there was a disposition to wait for definite indications as to whether or not the new minimum of 38 on Steel would prove low enough* to insure activity in the stock. The opening on Steel was made at prices from 38% down to 38. but a few minutes later there was a rally of a fraction from the minimum price. The preferred, selling ex-dividend, opened at 102%, the equivalent of ^Saturday’s closing price of 104%.
• Interborough-Metropolitan preferred opened ’4 up at 531m and was one of the active features on rumors that a dividend would be declared before the end of the present year. Amalgamated Copper started at 54%, a gain of %.
Union Pacific, at 119 %, was one of the few stocks to open at a decline, and its lo»s was only I4. Reading gained % on the first sale, and the railroad issues generally showed very little change.
Jtisv iii Sears-Roebuck
During the first half hour the market was dull without disclosing any definite tendency. Reading, which had opened up. sagged off; while Union Pacific, which had started at a decline, developed an improving tendency. The action of Steel was inconclusive, and the whole market -waited on that.	,
Seurs-Roebuck, responding to the declaration of a 50stock dividend, advanced to 209% compared witn 193% at Saturday’s close. Street taking it for grunted that the dividend rate would be maintained, and when applied to the increased volume of stock would be the same as a substantial increase in the rate of disbursement.
Steel rallied tt> 28but the raJlv of from the minimum was no mote than had occur:ed on Friday, when the stock sold at 40in the first hour. bu.t became unsaleable inter in the day. The traders said there -would have to be u considerably larger rally to prove that the present minimum price i:- low enough.
A reaction
Towards the end of the first hour the market sold off with an increase of activity on the decline; but although the traders said it would be necessury to make a further reduction in the minimum on Steel, and that this would bring the whole market to a lower level, that stock met with fairly good support, and did not lose its sale ability at 3S, or a shade over.
Reading was a particularly weak feature, and the traders said the stock had been opened up to afford large interests an opportunity to dispose of a part of their holdings. From the initial price of Q46 there was a drop to 144%; and Canadian Pacific, after opening at 139%, fell back to 157, where it duplicated last week’s lowest.
The sinking of British merchant ships in the Irish Sea and the English Channel by German submarines was regarded as a «er.ous development in the war, and it was contended that further activity of the same kind would inevitably increase the volume and urgency of liquidation of American securities by British holders.
Sa-Istbility of StevI
A slight improving tendency developed in the second hour and at noon the market was firm at a moderate recovery from the low figures. Careful observers said there was good buying of stocks, but that it was conducted in a very quiet way.
For the first time since the dividend on Steel was passed that stock maintained its suleability all through the forenoon. On other -days it started off briskly, but the buying demand was s*oon satisfied and those who had to sell were obliged to go out on New street to make sales.
The announcement of the immediate success of the Pennsylvania bond offering.* the amount being largely over-subscribed on the opening of the subscription books, tended to strengthen investment sentiment, and was one of the factors which caused a somewhat better tendency in the stock market.
A rise in Kresge of 2%, bringing the price to 101%, was said to be sympathetic with the advance in Sears-Roebuck, which tended to stimulate speculative sentiment on the stocks of the mercantile companies in general.
Advance resumed	*
Steel, in the early afternoon, resumed its place as the leader of the market, advancing to 39% after having sold nt the minimum price of 38 in the first hour. It was the first time that the stock succeeded in getting well above the minimum price, and the effect was sufficient to drive many of the shorts to cover, not only in that issue but elsewhere in -the list.
The traders had a rumor that a New York syndicate had taken over 150.000 shares of United States Steel from Amsterdam last week at 35. The story was not widely credited, but it was evident that large interests were buying the stock at the prevailing level, and it was inferred that they would take it in quantity at lower prices if the offer of a large block were made to them.
The advance in the price of copper to a 14%-cent basis helped the whole list, as it encouraged expectation of a general business revival. Amalgamated Copper rallied to <54% after having sold at 52%. Canadian Pacific recovered 2 points by selling up to 159, and Reading showed pronounced strength, advancing to 146% compared with a low of 144% in the forenoon. '

Good technical condition	_
A little reaction which occurred in the late afternoon seemed to be only one of the earmarks of a bull market. It tended to discourage buying by weak speculators and covering of shorts by traders thus preserving the market’*; condition of technical strength. When it ceased, prices recovered easily.
Although the earnings of the St. Paul for December were unfavorable, showing a substantial decrease of gross and a relatively heavier decline in net, it produced no effect, the Street looking upon railroad statements for the last month of 1914 as a reflex of conditions already past, there being now an inclination to look forward to better things in the spring.	•
