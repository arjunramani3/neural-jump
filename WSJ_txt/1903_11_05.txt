Declines were general in the railroad list extending to - over two points to Missouri Pacific,and Northwest, a point or more in St. Pau£ Brie seconds. Pennsylvania and Southern Bailway pfd., and substantial fractions were knocked off the prices of all the active issues in the course’of the day. The Gould and Standard Oil stocks were about the weakest.	•
\ . The severe decline in TT. S. Steel was the feature of . the industrial group, but such active issues as Smelter. ’Amalgamated Copper. Locomotive.

face of a renewal of the continued weakness in that security.	•
.The weakness in Smelters seemed to be based upon an erroneous assumption that the c’ompauy was in some way affected by the cut in the price of capper. The stock, still seems to be very closely held.
It is known that Toronto has some Tennessee Coal Iron for sale, and it is passible that some of the weakness in it was due to selling from that quarter.	*
The specialists had some selling orders in Amalgamated Copper which reflected to some extent the heavy tone in London.
More than two-fifths of the day's transactions were in V. S. Steel common and preferred.
Shoarson. ITamuiill & Co. wore among the conspicuous supporters of Steel preferred.
Pittsburg was a heavy seller of the Steel stocks during the day.
-.	GEXEIIAL INFLUENCES
The London trading was distinctly noticeable for the heavy selling of the U. S. Steel stocks. Sales for ■fcToign account in these issues and principally’the preferred-amounted, to at least 25.000 shares. The buying in the general list offset the selling there and probably <l:d not amount to more than 5.000, shares additional, about evenly divided. It is not impossible that London got some of its orders in Steel from the continent, but the best informed arbitrage houses think that, the oraors "for the most part arc sent there from this side.
. The rumors indicating financial trouble in the "London stock exchange need not be treated seriously. Failures are never announced there in the middle of an account. and the earliest date at which nay would be in the •least likely to be made public would .be November 12th. at'the conclusion of the fortnightly account. The stories all seem to be the wanning up of an old report, and contains nothing which was not. perfectly well-known to everybody whom it concerned nearly a month ago.
There was a notable increase in the demand for stocks in the loan crowd. The general rate wn> unchanged at 3’/•>%. but Pennsylvania. New York Central ano Canadian Pacific were in request, and Steel preferred was in considerable demand. Some of this was probably due to the fact that the arbitrage houses were heavy sillers and were borrowing the stock until its arrival from the other side.
... The trading in bonds was in moderate volume with a weak tone in Wabash Bs and some further depression in If- S."Steel 5s. It is understood that the bond underwriting syndicate is allowing the market for these to takci.carc. of itself. . Government issues were steady without.feature. Total sales $2,047,000.
< ; 'The official cut of one-quarter cent in price of the metal explained some of the early weakness in Amalga* mated Copper. This is the first reduction by the Unit-jd Metals-Selling Company, and was therefore taken as a significant trade development.
'The Weil brokers were extensive borrowers of stocks after, the close.	_
RAILWAYS.
There was some evidence that Toronto was a careful seller of Canadian Pacific, where the market would take it. .This is probably old stock remaining from the financial disturbance early in the year which is being gradually liquidated by the banks. It is understood that Twin jCity, Detroit Union, Sloss-Sheffield and Tennessee Coal & Iron have all been sold in the same way in the past few_months. There is probably not much of this stock left.

. The weakness in Missouri Pacific gave a good deal of point to the opinion expressed by the shrewder traders on .Wednesday that the Standard Oil interest was bearish on the market outlook. The brokers usually acting for the* Gould crowd seemed to be making no attempt to take care of the stocks of that particular group, and they are generally credited with taking their inspiration on the market from 20 Broadway.
The action of the tractions were disappointing to the market. .Metropolitan sold off very easily on some profittaking by people who had bought before ike election It is:thought, however, that politicians were put into the stock in the neighborhood of 106, and that the stock bought by traders on the advance was sold on Wednesday.
George P. Butler <fc Bros, wore said to have given :out selling orders in about 10,000 Missouri Pacific. The best support was from Harriman <fc Co., who took the long side’higher up some days ago. -The movement had (Something of the aspect of an attempt to shake out some weak bulls. •	’	'	s
