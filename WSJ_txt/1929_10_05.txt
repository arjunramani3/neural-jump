Market Vndcrgoe* House-Cleaning
Technical conditions in the main body of1 stocks were subjected to drastic readjustment last week. Heavy selling’ went ahead throughout the list, representing largely the process of correction necessitated by the prolonged advance during the summer months, which created on overbought position in the principal trading issues.
Liquidation was given impetus by the increase of $6G7,000,000 in the loans of Stock Exchange members last month, and by the lur-ther gain of $43,000,000 set forth in the weekly Federal Reserve figures given out after Thursday’s close Friday’s session was characterized by wholesale unloading of stocks carried on margin.
Transactions for the five-hour session totaled 5.623.900 shares, and stocks used m the Dow-Jones industrial average broke to new iow ground cn the movement at 325.17. a decline of exactly 56 points from the record high, estab-l.sbed September 3. This extensive recession brought about iimportant strengthening of t -f market’s inside petition. At the same time, it attracted organized buying by influential banking interests and investment trusts, and nctixe stocks scored an aggressive recovery m the brief trading period at the week-end. Industrials used in the Dow-Jone3 averages ral’ied 16 19 points to 341.36. and the whole market displayed a greatly improved tone.
Money In Supply
A surplus of funds poured into New York last week which demand was unable to absorb, with the result call money went to 6^^ officially on Thursday and Friday, as compared with high of 10^; on Monday and Tuesday, while m the ’’outside” market funds were available at 5%^^ and 5r,. Not since late May has money stayed as low as 6r'f for two days in a row. The present ease is probably somewhat temporary, due to return flow of funds from October 1 dividend and interest payments, and also to the declining stock market.	*
Last week’s bank statements were most reassuring. showing leading New York City banks m unusually liquid condition and the Reserve banks with high reserve ratios, despite fall credit and currency demands. Reporting member banks m New York City on October 2 were borrowing only $63,000,000 from the reserve bank, compared with $147,000,000 a week previous and $256,000,000 at this time last year. Current borrowings, incidentally, are the lowest since May. 192S. The reserve banks are still purchasing bankers’ acceptances in liberal amounts to facilitate credit demands, last week’s purchases having totaled nearly $59,000,000.
The week’s increase of $43,000,000 in brokers’ loans, while a surprise to many, was undoubtedly due in part to heavy stock financing. Furthermore. the drastic market declines of Wednesday and Thursday were not reflected in the statement. Washington opinion leans to the new that last week’s loan figures probably represented the peak of the recent loan expansion
Foreign Exchanges Strong
A sharp rally throughout the list, accompanied by brisk activity, featured the foreign exchange market last Monday and Tuesday, with sterling and francs making new highs at $4,86 9-16 and $.0392%, respectively. Month and quarter end demand was the controlling factor in the better tone. In the case of sterling, considerable short selling had been in progress both before and just after rise in the English bank rate. Many of these commitments had to be covered for month-end delivery'. Francs appreciated m response to urgent demand for Paris funds at the close of the month and quarter which caused withdrawal of French balances both in New York and London. This demand has now eased appreciably, but both the currencies are higher than a week ago. Sterling closed at $4,86 7-32 for cables and francs at $.0392’4.
Principal development in the sterling situation since rise in the bank rate is cessation of metal flow from London to Paris as the sterling rate against francs rose above the gold export point. Bank of England lost nearly £3,000,000 to France after the rise to 6%%. There now seems good prospect that the bank will obtain a sizeable portion of the new gold available in London during the next few weeks, and it is known that shipments of sovereigns are being arranged from New Zealand and Argentine, which will also aid m building up the depicted metal stock.
Response to the higher Bank of England rate, which is now beginning to be effective, has been seen in better tone throughout the European list. Lire are being quoted at about $.0523%. Guilders were quoted as high as $.4018, but closed a little easier at $.4015 % to 16. Both Swiss francs and belgas, which regularly move in sympathy with sterling, are materially higher. Former is being quoted around $.1930% and the latter at $.1394. Marks moved irregularly during the week, but closed easier at $.2383 to 83%. Canadian dollars declined sharply at the end of the week to 11-16% discount. Traders attribute the easier tone to remittances to cover margin calls following the break in the New York stock market. Hongkong dollars declined nearly $.03 to $.4500 on Friday and Saturday, due to a rumor that Hongkong government intends to lift the existing embargo on Shanghai silver dollars, worth about $.40. This has tended to reduce the spread between Shanghai and Hongkong dollars.
Steel Rale Up 4%
An unexpected event in the steel industry was United States Steel’s action in increasing its rate of operations by 4% over the previous week. The corporation is now running at about 89% of capacity, and the industry as a whole at arourid 35%, practically the same as last year r.r this time. Increase in operations was attributed to anticipation of needs for rail require-
meats. In fact railroad buying was the most sustaining factor m the steel trade during the week. Evidences of further car orders and rail . ; buying appeared, and this tended to offset the . 'declining rate of steel consumption by the auto- | 1 mobile trade.	;
Lessened auto demand resulted in a some- , what easier market m steel sheets, but the j Dow. Jones steel average remained unchanged j at S50.29 a ton. Structural steel lettings were ; m good volume at 50,000 tons, and for the first nine months, reports showed that volume of ■ structural lettings was running well ahead of j last year. Steel pipe makers continued at peak • activity of the year in some districts, and tin ■ plate makers enjoyed good business. These , favorable factors counteracted to a large extent 1 the adverse developments m other lines.
Pig iron production for September set a new record for that month though off from August, and the nine months’ showing passed the pre-I Vious high mark for that period by 5%. Prices i of iron have held up well m the face of lessened | steel activity, but scrap has been weak lately I m the principal centers.
Conditions existing in the steel trade during September makes it seem likely that unfilled tonnage of U. S. Steel Corp, will show a decline when they are announced the 10th, but outlook for the industry* was generally regarded as not unfavorable.	’
Radical Oil Curb Proposed
A constructive step was taken the past week when a committee of the Midcontinent Oil & Gas Association made the proposal to restrict production of crude oil in Oklahoma for the remainder of the year to 669,000 barrels. It is calculated this will be the amount of oil needed to meet demand. This would mean holding back about 140.000 barrels of crude oil production daily, since it is estimated potential production of Oklahoma would amount to 800.000 barrels daily if no restrictions were placed *on flush pools.
California, however, is still producing more oil than required, causing additional increases in storage. The gas law has not yet exerted an appreciable influence. Despite the reduction of 12,800 barrels daily in week ended September 28, the state was yielding 877.700 barrels a day. according to American Petroleum Institute.
