With pressure lifted, pivotal issues in the pre-holiday session of the stock market were able to score advances that ran to more than four points. The bond market was irregular, but second-grade rail issues were able to make some headway, in contrast to their weakness in the preceding few sessions. Wheat and cotton were firmer, wheat moving up almost a cent bushel, while cotton closed up 13 to 16 points, a late dip erasing some of the earlier gains.	'
The opening found stocks distinctly firm, and some sizable blocks changed hands at the start of trading, particularly in rail issues. Union Pacific, for Instance, opened at 58^., up 3*£, on a 1.200 share transaction, "While Chesa-peak^ & Ohio scored an overnight advance of l^i, selling at 19. Northern Pacific and'Great Northern, which have been under pressure recently, moved*, forward, and Central was a strong spot. Telephone, at 101, was up 1, and Steel common opened fractionally higher.
The market moved slowly higher through the morning, and then rallied fairly strongly at the start of the final hour, but near the close, it eased somewhat from the best levels. American Can ended the day at 49, up 2%: DuPont at 34’/s, up 1%; J. I. Case at 39}*. up 2%. and Union Pacific at 60, up 4}». Telephone, at 103, was up 3. Trading volume was 1,700,000 shares, against 2.300.000 Monday.
An advance in crude oil prices, following on the heels of the action taken in Texas to curb output, stimulated shares. Standard close to 2 points, other oil issues.
The Dow-Jones the week ended 19}£% of capacity, up about 2 vious week.
Telephone, which had been pressure Monday, was firmer all lication of the September figures on telephone installations served to bring a late rally in the stock. In September, the company lost slightly less than 90.000 telephones against losses of 201,000 in August and 268,000 in July.
The Reconstruction Finance Corp, reported a sharp decline in commercial loans in September. They were off to about $62,000,000, the smallest monthly total since the corporation was formed, and less than 50% of the August figure.
The markets abroad were improved. In London, securities staged a general advance, stimulated by the terms of the new British conversion offer, with its import of cheap money. In Pans, prices on the bourse showed considerable improvement.
Salutary Step for the Oil Industry-
Just when the picture presented by the oil industry was beginning to look quite weak, with price cuts threatened, the Texas Railroad Commission- ordered a drastic cut in production, to take effect October 15, altering the outlook completely. If the commission’s order is carried out, production of crude will be brought more in balance with demand, and thte price structure will be maintained. As a matter of fact, the commission’s order brought an immediate reaction in the form of an advance in crude prices.
The major improvement in the oil trade took place early in the spring, when the industry put its house in order. The second quarter earnings reports reflected the betterment markedly, with practically every unit in the industry doing better than in the first. The third quarter reports. usually the best of the year, should be about tn line with those for the second quarter. Demand for gasoline sags in the fourth quarter, and earnings with it, but if the price structure is mnintflinod, the showing for most units should be at least fair.

bf 10 public utility issues r.n September 8 was 90.30, against 90.90 Tuesday night, up close to a point, while the average of 10 industrial bonds, at 77.22, was down only 2.82 from the September 8 closing level.
In the debacle in the spring, the average of 10 high-grade rails was off 7.34 points between March 8 and April 8, the average of 10 public utility issues dipped from 87.74 to 87.52, off about a fifth of a point, and the average of 10 industrials sagged from 77.20 to 70.05, off 7.15. In both periods stocks were weak.
The Nash Quarterly Report
The Nash Motors report for the quarter ended August 31 was something to wonder at, considering that its total output of cars for the period was only about 2,500 units, or in the neighborhood of one week's production if the company's plant were running at capacity. Production for the three months was roughly a quarter' as large as for the previous quarter, but net of 6 cents a share was a little more than half the net for the preceding period.
Nash is such a well Integrated producing unit and has such large revenue producing investments that it can show earnings for the stock when other companies are in red ink figures. Inventories looked low as of November 30, 1931, when they stood at roughly $1,300,000, but they are down to approximately $500,000, so Nash has no inventory problem. Its holdings of cash and government securities, at $32,935,083, only down about $500,000 from the end of previous quarter.	,
September Rail Reports
September railroad reports wilt start riving in volume within the next two weeks,
a number of them should make good reading, judging by the traffic improvement. There is considerable interest in what the Union Pacific will show in net railway operating income, as September is normally an excellent month for the road.
In the four weeks ended August 27, loadings of the road were off 24.6% from August. 1931. Net railway operating income for the month was down only 18% from the similar month of 1931.
In the two weeks ended September 17, loadings over the road were off only 19.1% from the 1931 weeks, and in the week ended September 24 loadings were down only about 15%. In the four weeks ended August 27 the road handled 66,062 cars, and in the one week ended September 24 it handled more than 21,000 cars.
Union Pacific in September. 1931, had net railway operating income of $3,918,381.

“Purely Gossip”—
London and Canada have been buying Canadian Pacific, say brokers interested.
Those in the Street who talk about “testing zones” in the market are of the opinion that today will make for an important “test” as to the power of the market to rally and if it does not come back substantially, say these traders, lower prices can be anticipated.
Holders of National Biscuit have been interested to learn that most of the company’s cash resources are in New York City bonds. Brokers believe that the company will maintain the present dividend rate for the balance of the year.
Bankers report that there is an increased total of buying; of our securities by Europe, particularly Amsterdam.
Brokers say there are few signs of increased activity of pools and that most of them have been content with supporting their shares at the present levels.

Rural Banks* Improvement Shown
Notable improvement in the banking situation outside New York City is shown by the statement of reporting member banks for the week ended October 5. Loans and investments in cities outside New York have ^ield most of the Detter than $170,000,000 rise in this account which took place in the week ended September 21 and are currently $146,000,000 above the low point of the depression. Last week there was an increase of $17,000,000 in the "all other" loans of these banks, the largest advance of the year.
In the rural banks a marked rise In member banks' reserve balances and a sharp drop in their borrowings from the Federal Reserve took place. Reserve deposits of rural banks were up $18,000,000 to $456,000,000, continuing the rising trend of the past three weeks. Reserve borrowings were off $13,000,000 to $226,000,000, a new low for the year and comparing with the year’s peak of $371,000,000.
The decline of $25,000,000 in total 'loans and investments shown by all reporting banks was almost entirely due to normal month-end turnover of funds in New York, where the decline in this item amounted to $22,000,000. The largest decline was the $40,000,000 reduction in security loans, $14,000,000 of which was accounted for by New York banks and $8,000,000 by Chicago Institutions.
High-Grade Bonds Hold
Proof that investor confidence has returned to the markets Is offered by the action of the highest grade bonds in the face of pronounced weaknes in stocks during the current reaction. It is In striking contrast to the performance of bonds in a similar period of reaction in stock prices last spring, when even the best grade issues faded away in a torrent of selling.
On September 8 the Dow-J ones average of 10 high-grade rail Issues closed at 88.02, and Tuesday night’s close was at 88.0. The average
