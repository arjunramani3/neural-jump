The prospect of new government action to create jobs and keep auto makers out of the ditch sent stocks higher for a second consecutive day, amid hopes that a worstcase scenario for the global economy could be avoided.
Gains in the U.S. were part of a world-wide rally triggered by President-elect Obama's plan for a stimulus package that would include large infrastructure development. Congress appeared closer to a deal to keep the auto industry running until the new administration and Congress can consider a more permanent solution.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 298.76 points, or 3.5%, to 8934.18, its highest close in a month. General Motors led the gains, jumping 21%. Ford Motor, which isn't a Dow component, rose 24%. GM and Ford still are trading at less than $5 a share.
Materials and industrial companies rose on the possibility of new infrastructure projects. Alcoa rose nearly 18% and Caterpillar 11%. Dow Chemical rose 7.2% after the company said it will cut about 5,000 full-time jobs, or 11% of its work force.
The gains followed a broad stock-market rally Friday, the same day the government announced that more than a half million jobs were lost in November. The Dow is up 6.7% over the two days.
The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 3.8% Monday to 909.70, for a two-day gain of 7.6%.
Stocks rose in Europe and Asia. Markets in France and in Hong Kong both jumped 8.7%.
Commodities prices also rose, oil by 7.1% to $43.71 a barrel, and copper by 9.1%. Treasury prices and the dollar fell as investors moved to riskier assets.
