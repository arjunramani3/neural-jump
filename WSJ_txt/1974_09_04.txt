Slock prices were dr aJt dnother sLg-gunng blow yesLerday oa tbe faJLermg Dow Jones industrial average neared its 1970 low xxx the heaviest trading in more tha-n seven weeks.
Disappointment over tH**	of last
Friday's rally to continue this week or even hold its ground was noted by Newton D. Z;nder, vice president of E. F. Hutton 4c Co. And Leslie M. Pollack, senior vice president of Hayden Stone Inc., said there was “panic m the air resulting from the buildup of recent pressures on the mar-Xet.”
After sliding 15.25 points on Tuesday, the industrial average yesterday dropped another 15.33 points to 648. its lowest level since it closed at 631.16 May 26. 1970. The transportation indicator also hit its lowest mark since 1970 and the utility average its lowest levei since November 1954. At 2 p.m.. the industrial average was off 20.34 points.
Among developments this week that helped depress investor psychology, brokers said, was news that First National City Bank boosted its interest charges on consumer loans and that Britain's Lloyds Bank may have a loss of as much as the equivalent of $76 million because of “irregularities” at a Swiss branch.
Negative Factors Cited
Also cited was the statement by L. William Seidman, executive director of this month’s anti-inflation summit, that “fundamental” economic decisions by President Ford aren’t likely soon after the summit meeting because Congress doesn’t have time for major new legislation this year. Another unsettling factor was news that Saudi Arabia reportedly has agreed to oppose efforts to reduce crude oil prices.
Last Friday’s rally was fueled partly by a drop in Treasury bill rates, but this week those rates moved sharply higher.
Hayden Stone’s Mr. Pollack said he believes yesterday’s action had some hints of a selling climax, which is a sharp price drop followed by a fast rebound in accelerated trading volume. New York Stock Exchange volume yesterday rose to 16.930,000 shares from 12,750,000 on Tuesday and was the highest since 17.768,830 shares were traded July 12. Trades of 10.000 shares or more. indicating institutional activity, climbed a bit to 84 from the prior day’s revised total of 81.
Another broker who thinks a rally “is in the making’’ is Michael T. Murray, vice president of Robert W. Baird & Co. He noted the current extreme pessimism because of inflation and fears of a recession and he thinks that “interest rates have behaved pretty well the past four or five weeks” despite their lofty level. He added that some commodity prices have declined.
The extensive damage done by yesterday’s retreat was apparent from the better than seven-to-one lead of Big Board losers, with 1,333 stocks down and 187 up at the final bell. There were 597 new 1974 lows, more than twice the 237 on Tuesday and only one new high, compared with two the day before.
Losers were ahead on the American Stock Exchange by about five-to-one and the exchange’s index slipped 1.74 to 67.38. Volume expanded to 2,100,000 shares from 1,500,000 on Tuesday. A sizable loss of 1.93 was posted by the National Association of Securities Dealers* NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter stocks; it finished at 58.95.
Prices of prime corporate bonds lost an average of about % point but long-term governments were up about 4-32 point in over-the-counter trading.
Swept lower in yesterday’s Big Board pullback were computer, chemical, housing. copper, retail, drug, electronic, auto, oil, paper, publishing, television, rubber, steel, gold and tobacco issues.
