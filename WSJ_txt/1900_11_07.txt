THE WHEAT POSITION.
Wheat developed considerable weakness oti principally bull news. The sharp advance in <-a-Lies, unfavorable Argentine private cables and :» sentimental inlliieuce as :» result of the election, made the strong opening t lie top price for the day. The increase in Bradstreet's visible supply and afloat for and in Europe was rhe first and about the ‘inly bearish iiitluenee of the day. but realizing sales found few bills am! foreign houses were sellers. The weakness increased io the close.
On the bite decline there was a fair business done for export. Tin* important part tlie Argentine crop is to play in the speculation in tin* near futlire becomes more apparent, and at least one expert from the ••States” is on the ground and already been hoard from. By a coincidence, however. wheat has of late declined on the strongest bull news from that quarter. After the close the curb was firm. Puts and calls sold cents each way.	’
