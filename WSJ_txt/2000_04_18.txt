Investors yesterday continued to recover from Friday's frightening fall in the stock market, expanding their buying even to some speculative technology names they had left for dead last week. The buying has driven the Nasdaq Composite Index, over Monday and yesterday, to its biggest two-day percentage gain ever, 14.2%.
Although broader-market indexes haven't quite returned to their levels of Friday morning, the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite now has erased all of Friday's nearly 9.7% loss and more. Yesterday's Nasdaq gain of 254.41 points, or 7.19%, to 3793.57, eclipsed Monday's as its biggest point gain ever, and the second-biggest ever in percentage terms. The index still is far from its highs, deep in bear-market territory, but it is trading back where it was on Thursday.
On paper, investors yesterday recovered a total of about $551 billion in lost market value, based on the market value of the companies in the Wilshire 5000 index, which rose to $15.32 trillion. The Wilshire 5000 includes about 7,200 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company with headquarters in the U.S. Adding in Monday's gain of $430.6 billion, the overall market, as measured by the Wilshire, now has recovered almost half the $2.14 trillion in market value lost last week. It is virtually back to where it began the day on Friday, down just 7% from its March 24 record close.

Investors have begun patching the Nasdaq balloon, and perhaps pumped some air back in.
Investors yesterday continued to recover from Friday's frightening fall in the stock market, expanding their buying even to some speculative technology names they had left for dead last week. The buying has driven the Nasdaq Composite Index, over Monday and yesterday, to its biggest two-day percentage gain ever, 14.2%.
Although broader-market indexes haven't quite returned to their levels of Friday morning, the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite now has erased all of Friday's nearly 9.7% loss and more. Yesterday's Nasdaq gain of 254.41 points, or 7.19%, to 3793.57, eclipsed Monday's as its biggest point gain ever, and the second-biggest ever in percentage terms. The index still is far from its highs, deep in bear-market territory, but it is trading back where it was on Thursday.
Some market insiders warned that, in a year filled with enormous one-day and multiday swings, there isn't any guarantee against another rout later. But for a second day, mutual funds reported that individual investors were hanging toughavoiding cashing in their holdings, and in some cases, buying more stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average also surged, but much less than Nasdaq in percentage terms. The blue chips rallied 184.91 points, or 1.75%, to 10767.42. In two days the industrial average has recouped 75% of Friday's 617.78-point sag.
Although the Nasdaq composite still is down 24.9% since hitting a record on March 10 (a bear market is a drop of 20% or more), it now is back above Thursday's close, the day before the rout.
Bonds were mixed, following Monday's big declines, and the dollar advanced.
Among the big stock gainers yesterday: Internet stock Akamai Technologies, which on Monday was down 80% from its high and yesterday soared 31% off that low base, and wireless software group Aether Systems, which leapt 54% after being down 77% from its high.
The buying pressure was heavy from the opening bell, said Pat Davis, head of Nasdaq trading at PaineWebber. As has often been the case this year, buying demand surged at day's end, as some professional investors stepped up their purchases.
"Some of these stocks have just gotten taken apart, some of them down 50% or more," Mr. Davis said. "People are starting to think that things had just gotten overdone, and they kind of rode on the coattails of the bigger stocks."
Is it a lasting phenomenon? Mr. Davis laughed. "A lasting phenomenon is a day now," he said. "I can't imagine that these things are out of the woods yet."
On paper, investors yesterday recovered a total of about $551 billion in lost market value, based on the market value of the companies in the Wilshire 5000 index, which rose to $15.32 trillion. The Wilshire 5000 includes about 7,200 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company with headquarters in the U.S. Adding in Monday's gain of $430.6 billion, the overall market, as measured by the Wilshire, now has recovered almost half the $2.14 trillion in market value lost last week. It is virtually back to where it began the day on Friday, down just 7% from its March 24 record close.
Unlike Monday, when the gains were narrowly focused on big, safe-seeming stocks such as Cisco Systems and Intel, the great majority of stocks advanced yesterday. Leaders of the Dow industrials included American Express, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, J.P. Morgan, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. The main losers were conservative industrial and consumer-product names such as Eastman Kodak, Alcoa and Procter & Gamble.
Fund managers once again were struck by the willingness of small investors to shrug off the day-to-day market turmoil and stick with stocks, much as they did during market drops in 1987 and 1998. Mutual funds that had expected redemptions said they saw little or no net outflows of money. Many investors simply did nothing, and some, who had cash available, bought stocks.

Nasdaq Rallies Again, Erasing Friday's Plunge - ProQuest
"I'm very confident the market will come back," said Joe Kolb, a small business owner in Smithfield, R.I. Mr. Kolb, who sold some stocks in March because he felt they had risen too fast, decided they were cheap enough to buy after Friday's sell-off. He bought Avanex, a fiber-optics company, and Turnstone Systems, a company that provides services to local-exchange carriers.
Bullish investment strategist Thomas Galvin of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette said mutual-fund groups told him they had been delaying investing new money amid last week's market drop, which saw the Nasdaq composite lose 25% of its value. Mutual funds feared big redemptions, which once again didn't materialize. The fund managers began buying stocks this week. Something similar has happened during previous periods of market turmoil.
"Everybody, me included, thought we had better lighten up our mutual funds a bit" to keep some cash on hand in case of redemptions, said Henry Blackstock, director of research at SouthTrust Asset Management, Birmingham, Ala. "When no redemptions came in, you had everybody stepping in and pushing up the market."
But many investors worry that the rebound, for all its magnitude, is just a bounce before the market turns back down.
"I wouldn't be surprised if you were up for the balance of the week and then maybe next week you could take a hit again," Mr. Blackstock warned. As for enormous recent market swings, he said, "I've never seen anything like it. You have a lot of momentum investors who want to jump on and jump off, depending on what the market is doing, and they are exacerbating the moves in both directions." He added: "We are a little skeptical that the correction process is complete. So we are keeping some firepower on the sidelines in the form of cash."
Whether stocks can extend their twoday surge will depend in part on investor reaction to first-quarter earnings reports, many of which are coming out this week. Tech heavyweights Intel, America Online, International Business Machines and Qualcomm reported after the market closed. All beat earnings expectations, but Intel and IBM didn't beat them by enough. Their stocks fell in after-hours trading, while Qualcomm rose and AOL was little changed.
"I think we are on earnings watch to see how the big stocks will perform," said John Peluso, head of block trading at Lehman Brothers.
Another factor is the monthly expiration of options contracts, which will take place Thursday because of the market's close for Good Friday this week. Given the market's volatility in recent weeks, options-related stock trading could be heavy, and some traders said it might already be helping push stocks up.
One sign of how the scorned have returned to favor: The Dow Jones Internet Index, which at Friday's close was down almost 54% from its March 9 record, leapt 14% yesterday; the index still is down almost 45% from its high, however.
Biotech stocks, also among last week's casualties, also bounced back yesterday.
The Dow industrials, which never rose or fell as fast as the Nasdaq, now are down just 8.2% from their Jan. 14 record close. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which advanced another 2.87% yesterday, is down 5.6% from its March 24 record close.
Yesterday's 7.19% Nasdaq gain was close to its biggest percentage gain ever, 7.34% on Oct. 21, 1987, when the market was recovering from the 1987 market crash. This week's two-day Nasdaq gain far exceeds the two-day rebound of that era, which had been the strongest ever. In 1987, stocks gradually continued upward, although traders stressed that there isn't any guarantee they will do the same this time.
The average share of stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange rose 96 cents, or 2.35%, to $41.69.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 2.96 points to 177.28.
In major market action:
Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares traded, 1,926 stocks advanced and 1,048 declined.
Bonds were mixed. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32, or $2.50 for a $1,000 bond, pulling the yield down to 5.906%.
The dollar rose. Late in New York, it traded at 94.74 cents to the euro and 104.75 yen to the dollar, from 95.25 cents and 104.46 yen.
