Industrial Index Soars 28.39 Points to 631.02, Biggest Gain in 16 Months; Volume Is Heavy
By VICTOR J. H1LLERY
After initially according President Ford's anti-inflation plan a lukewarm reception, the stock market yesterday suddenly erupted in an explosive rally that earned the Dow Jones Industrial average to its biggest gain in more than 16 months. And trading surged to the highest level in four months.
"Wall Street generally was unimpressed with the President's proposals but when no serious selling developed, the buyers Just moved in," observed John Smith, Fahnestock & Co. partner. "The tact that the administration is finally taking some action with the likelihood that Congress will act began to sink in and produce a favorable reaction.” said Eldon A. Grimm, vice president of Birr, Wilson & Co.
The industrial average rocketed 28.39 points to 631.02, its biggest leap since it racked up a 29.42-point rise on May 21, 1973. In the first hour yesterday the indicator sank 7.20 points but in the next hour it reversed itself and was up 7.82 points at 12:30 p.m. The transportation and utility averages also took giant strides.
Underscoring the wide sweep of the advance were the 1,220 New York Stock Exchange issues that gamed, more than four times the 264 losers. This was a switch from the morning pattern, when declines were in the lead.
An important factor behind the "buying panic,” brokers also said, was the recent softening in Interest rates. A few more banks jomed the parade in cutting their prime lending rates to 11%% from 12% and expectations increased that the rate would go to 11%%. The rate on federal funds, the reserves banks lend to each other, dipped below 10% this week. "Rates don’t have to come down very much as long as people perceive that they are coming down," commented Larry Wachtel, Bache & Co. vice president.
Big Board volume boiled to 18,820,000 shares from 15,460,000 on Tuesday and was the highest since 19,023,670 shares were traded June 7. The stepped-up institutional activity was mirrored in the climb in the trades of 10,000 shares or more to 130 from the previous day’s revised total of 112.
Buck Kisor, senior vice president of Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis Inc., reported more European and institutional buying than had been apparent in recent sessions. Gary Wollin, Muller & Co. analyst, said “the upturn may be a rally in a bear market but this is the first time I’ve been bullish in two years.” Amex Index Also Spurted
The American Stock Exchange index spurted 2.30 points to 65.54, and gainers exceeded losers by about five-to-two. Turnover quickened to 1,830,000 shares from 1,550,000 Tuesday. The National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose
1.44	to 57.57.
In the over-the-counter bond market, prime corporates climbed about % point but long-term governments slipped about % point.
Most Big Board stock groups participated in the rally, and computers and oils were particularly strong.
Helping to propel glamour stocks, brokers said, was nervous short covering, or buying of shares to replace borrowed stock sold earlier. In active trading, Avon climbed 2% to 24% and McDonald’s, 2% to 25%; brokers said the Ford administration’s decision to forgo gasoline rationing helped McDonald’s. Xerox, which disclosed terms of the proposed settlement of the Federal Trade Commission’s complaint against the company, jumped 4% to 68%. Hughes Tool gained 4% to 50%; a fed-
