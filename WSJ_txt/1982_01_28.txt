Stocks Surge on Heavy Turnover Despite Absence of Bullish News
A.br*east off the Market
By George Anders
Stock prices surged yesterday to their biggest gain in more than 10 months, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.59 to 864.25. Volume swelled past 66 million shares, the most since last March.
“Well before the market opening, there was an aura of bullishness among traders on the floor,” said Michael Manos, a market analyst at Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins Inc. "The market's been oversold. and the mood just changed.” Yesterday's rally came m the absence of any market-moving news, though some analysts spoke of latent technical strength in the market earlier this week.
"The bears took an early lunch and never came back,” declared Ronald Glantz, Paine Webber's research director. Nearly every industry group gained ground, and advancing issues led decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by more than five to one.
The American Stock Exchange index posted its second largest gain on record, and Newton Zinder, market analyst at E.F. Hutton & Co., said he was “impressed by stocks' persistent and very orderly strength.” The Dow Jones industrials were up 7.61 in the first half hour alone, and never faltered. The transportation and utilities average showed comparable gains.
“You could see this coming Wednesday,” said John Sutherlin, a vice president at Crocker National Bank. Hutton’s Mr. Zinder noted that favorable technical signs Tuesday included heavy short selling of borrowed stock, a
broad market stronger than the Dow Jones industrials, and an upturn in the transportation index.
Merger interest provided some of yesterday’s sharpest gainers. Cannon Mills rose 5% to a 52-week high of 43%; major shareholders agreed to sell their stake to a subsidiary of Pacific Holding, which is offering S44 a share for the company. Heu-blein spurted 4 to 39 on volume of more than one million shares; it denied reports in The Wall Street Journal that it has talked with other companies that might acquire it.
But “this isn't a one day fluke,” Hutton's Mr. Zinder said, noting ample market strength elsewhere. The Wilshire 5000 index, a broad market measure, was up 2.69% to 1234.191. “This should carry a while,” Crocker's Mr. Sutherlin ventured. “It's pretty impressive coming off a lower area."
Both retail and institutional investors were active yesterday, Mr. Zinder said. Trades of 10,000 shares or more, a measure of institutional activity, jumped to 1,087 from Wednesday’s 755.
Rail stocks “still look pretty exciting,” Mr. Sutherlin said. Union Pacific rose 2% to 46%, Santa Fe gained 1% to 18%, Burlington Northern was up 1% to 51%, and Southern Pacific was up 1 to 37%.
Computer stocks were another market leader, with IBM rising 1% to 64% as the volume leader. Digital Equipment gained 2% to 88%, Control Data was up 1% to 34% and Honeywell leapt 4% to 74%. On the American Stock Exchange, Amdahl rose 1% to 26%.
Warner Communications, was active and up 4% to 61%; earnings estimates for its Atari games unit have been climbing. Tandy, also active, advanced 2% to 35%. Oil-Service Issues Strong
Among oil-service issues Schlumberger rose 2% to 52%, Hughes Tool spurted 2 to 34%, and NL Industries gained 3% to 34%. International oils showed modest gams. Among domestics, Getty was up 3% to 62, and Superior, the subject of takeover rumors, rose another 1% to 36%.
For companies reporting improved quarterly earnings, gams included 1% to 36% for Cray Research, 2% to 26% for Borg-Warner, 1% to 31% for Browning-Ferns, 1 to 23% for Witco Chemical, 1% to 40% for American Hospital Supply, 1 to 37% for R.R. Donnelley & Sons, 1% to 35% for Time, 1 to 24% for Ogden, and 1 to 34%
