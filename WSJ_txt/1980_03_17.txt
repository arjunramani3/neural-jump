Industrials Fall 23.04 in Wide Retreat Prompted by Anti-Inflation Program
Abreast of the Market
By Victob J. Hilltxy
Having had a look at Washington’s latest anti-inflation program, investors sent the Dow Jones industrial average plunging 23.04 points, its sharpest setback in more than five months. Trading was at one of the slowest paces of the year.
Recently strong oils and other natural resource stocks were hit the hardest as the industrial average fell to 788.65. its lowest level since finishing at 787.51 Dec. 18. 1978. The transportation and utility averages also sustained big setbacks.
The American Stock Exchange index dropped a record 12.83 points, closing at 249.20. The previous record was a decline of 12.26 points Oct. 9, 1979.
“Investor sentiment turned sharply negative as it became apparent that the Carter administration’s anti-inflation program wouldn't bring any near-term relief,” asserted Jacques S. Theriot, first vice president at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. “Additionally, it appears that the odds for a deeper and longer recession have increased.”
The retreat covered a broad front with defense, airline, housing, chemical, copper, electronic, movie and paper stocks joining the oils and metals in the pullback. Some of the computer and tobacco Issues gained, however. More than 1,400 New York Stock Exchange stocks lost ground, more than seven times the gainers.
“The budget message wasn't of great concern, but the action of the Federal Reserve this weekend was," said Bud Simons, vice president of Cowen & Co. “There’s concern that we are heading toward a credit crunch," because of the various fed moves to boost interest costs. Some bankers are predicting that banks’ prime, or basic lending, rate will climb to 20%; on Friday it reached a record 1814%.
In yesterday’s market, said Mr. Simons, “we were seeing the reverse of what was occurring a month ago; instead of a flight into stocks that represent assets, there was a rush” to get back into high-yielding liquid financial instruments..
"It seemed that no matter what Mr. Carter proposed some people didn’t like it and this suggests he’s going to get opposition to his program, which will bring us back to square one,” commented Alan C. Poole, vice president at Laidlaw Adams Peck Inc. “But it’s somewhat surprising Please Turn to Page 45, Column 3

Continued From Page £ that the market would be so weak with the dollar very strong in Europe."
Some of yesterday's selling was by people who have margin accounts, or carry their stock partly with loans from their brokers, said Mr. Poole. “People are aware of the high carrying costs of margined stock and we have been recommending that such accounts reduce their margin holdings and get into cash," meaning interest-bearing liquid securities.
The high interest rates “are squeezing the speculation out of stocks and commodities," contended Eldon A. Grimm, senior vice president at Birr, Wilson & Co. He also said that some investors had pulled back to wait “until the current storm in the market blows over.”
Robert Nurock, vice president at Butcher & Singer Inc., Philadelphia, asserted that “investors had low expectations for President Carter's anti-inflation program before it was announced and the actual measures didn't even achieve those expectations.”
He said that he expects the industrial average to fall below the 780 level, which some technicians regard as "an important support level." When this occurs he thinks the market's fall will accelerate and bring it quickly to a bottom, perhaps in a few days.
Mr. Theriot of Smith Barney also expects a rally to develop fairly soon because stock prices had been retreating for several sessions before they were hit with the events of the past weekend.
“Climactic Selling”
Yesterday's market action had some aspects of “climactic selling,” observed Larry Wachtel, senior vice president at Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc. However, yesterday's turnover of 37,020,000 shares was among the year’s lowest and didn’t fit the pattern of the heavy rush to sell that occurs in the typical climax; yesterday's volume was up from 35,180,000 Friday.
The low level of institutional participation in yesterday’s action was underscored by the 409 trades of 10,000 shares or more, down from 448 in the previous session.
Oil stocks were prominent on the active list. Texaco was the volume leader and slipped 2% to 33%. Gulf slid 4% to 38%; Mobil, 6% to 68%, and Exxon, 2% to 57%.
Other oil casualties included Superior, down 9% to 131; Cities Service, 4% to 86%; Marathon, 3% to 56%; Phillips, 3% to 45%; Standard Oil (Ohio), 3 to 86%; Indiana Standard, 4 to 98; California Standard, 2% to 70%; Sun, 4% to 70%, and McMoRan, 3 to 41%.
In the metals group, Asarco slid 3% to 34 in active trading; the company produces copper and other metals. In the gold group, ASA dropped 2% to 39%; Dome Mines, 4% to 54%; Homestake, 3 to 45%, and Campbell Red Lake, 3% to 28%, and Newmont, 2 to 38%. Newmont yesterday also cut its copper price.	’
Silver Losers
Among silver losers, Hecla skidded 5% to 26; Sunshine Mining, 4% to 26%, and Callahan Mining, 6% to 33.
One of the few gainers on the active list, Eastman Kodak climbed % to 45%; analysts attributed its strength to the drop in the price of silver which the company uses in photographic products.
American Cyanamid was another gainer on the active list; it rose 1% to 33; the company frequently has been the subject of merger rumors.
