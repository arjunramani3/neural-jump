nati, San Francisco and Salt Lake City were among the important cities which turned down municipal operation proposals in one form or another. Camden, N. J., approved a $10,000,000 bond Issue for production and distribution of electricity, and Columbus and Akron, in Ohio, leaned to the municipal operation side.
New York City bonds rose and the traction stocks were firm as an aftermath of the municipal election.
Volume Expands on Upswing
Trading; volume expanded rapidly yesterday as prices pushed upward. In the first three hours, volume reached only 550,000 shares, while in the fourth hour, when the first mark-up in prices occurred, transactions jumped to 470,000 shares, almost as much as in the first three hours. Volume dipped in the middle of the final hour, when profit-taking brought a minor setback in prices, *	‘

Day holiday furnished some inspiration for those looking for higher prices, but it did not spur the list at the outset. At least three out of the six states voting approved repeal, and the balloting on municipal operation of utility plants in a number of cities scattered over the country | revealed that advocates of public ownership didn’t have things all their own way. In several important cities, municipal operation proposals were flatly rejected.
The foreign exchange market furnished some noteworthy developments, calculated to inspire inflationary excitement. Sterling reached a now high, up around $4.98, and the dollar was weak i	_____________,___

High and Low
Stock Ex-
the domestic price of gold at $33.05 an ounce, another new high.	!
The 25-cent extra dividend by General Motors helped to bring interest into stocks. Railroad loadings reports for the latest week were moderately encouraging.
There was still pressure on the bond market, and prices eased all along the line. While the downward sag of the list continued, losses in individual issues were not as great as they had been recently. Government obligations were weak, the new 4U-3U issue touching a new low. United Kingdom and Swedish Government bonds were the outstanding strong spots in the foreign list.
While profit taking cut down the advance, grains closed not far from the top with an advance of from l“x to 2'S> cents a bushel. Coarse grains were higher, too. Cotton rallied after the appearance of the government forecast, closing up $1.75 a bale.
Foreign markets were higher. In London, the oil and the metal shares were the leaders. In Paris, the list was generally firmer.
i highs, and two stocks (Peoples Gas and Public Service Electric & Gas pfd.) made new low’s, for the year 1933.
Ward’s Sales Volume Soars
Farm belt troubles didn’t prevent Montgomery Ward’s sales in October from pushing ahead to a volume of $23,026,704, the best level of business the company has had since December, 1930, when volume topped the 28-million mark. Reports from Chicago have testified to the fact, borne out by the sales figures, that farmers are buying as they have not done for more than two years, in spite of the clamor in the farm belt for higher prices.	’
The bulge in Ward’s business has come in the mail order division, where low prices still prevail. In the retail store outlets the company operates, volume isn’t going forward, due to the fact that the public is showing resistance to rising prices.	!
Ward’s business in October, normally a good month for the company, showed a gain of 16.29< over the corresponding month of 1932. It was I the second widest advance over the correspond- : ing 1932 month for the year to date. In Au- , gust, the company’s business was 20.5% ahead i of the like month of 1932.	I
On a volume of business of only $15,65.7,254 i in August, the first month the company oper- 1 ated under the NRA, Ward is reported to have I shown a profit of approximately $460,000. Vol- i ume in September was roughly §1.000,000 ahead I of August. The October total of business, which j was 47% ahead of August, should permit the I company to show a good net profit for the third i quarter. For the first six months of its fiscal ■ period, ended July 31, Ward had a net loss of i $3,478,983.	I
Southern Railway’s Gross Up Again	I
In the closing week of October. Southern Railway's gross revenues again topped the cor- i responding week of 1982. In the second and ' third weeks of the month, gross fell under the corresponding period of the previous year for! the first time since the late spring, and caused some apprehension that a definite break in the 1 upward trend had come. The latest week’s figures stirred the hope that the upswing in earning power had been only interrupted, and not terminated.
International Troubles Brewing
The threat of devaluation of the Argentine peso and Great Britain’s denunciation of the tariff truce, agreed to before the London Conference last summer, arc two signs that international trouble is brewing again. Devaluation of the Argentine monetary unit, while it is calculated to raise internal prices and stem the tide of agricultural discontent in the South American republic, would have an adverse effect on world prices of wheat.
Great Britain, in denouncing the tariff truce, follows the lead of Holland, Switzerland, and the Scandinavian countries. Italy, while it hasn’t formally denounced the truce, has announced it plans putting on compensatory duties. Every / one of these moves helps to hamstring interna-| tional trade. The upward trend of the volume, of International business, since the summer of j 1932, has been the most favorable factor in the' world outlook.	!
Ballots Fail to Lift Stocks	i
Assurance thut at least three of the six states balloting on repeal would go wet had been so general that the announcement that Pennsylvania, Utah and Ohio had completed the group of 36 states necessary to bring about repeal did not excite the alcohol stocks in tho early trading yesterday. The group absorbed what little profit taking there was on the good news, and was firm throughout the day. If there arc no hitches, the first week in December will see the final ratification of tho states’ actions, and prohibition will come at an end. Between now and early December there should be considerable news bearing on tho effect of repeal on general business, as tho liquor companies make preparations to satisfy demand.
Balloting on municipal operation left both proponents and opponents dissatisfied. Cincln- ]
