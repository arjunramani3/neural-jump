Industrial Index Scores Gain of 17.06 to 648.08 In the Fifth-Heaviest Volume on Big Board
By Jambs Carberry
The slock market yesterday registered its second consecutive day of strong gains as some investors who had been sitting on the sidelines apparently decided to invest some of their cash. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the fifth highest ever
“The bargain hunters have moved in." commented Robert Stovall, director of in* vestments at Reynolds Securities. “People are fearful of missing the bottom of a bear market, if, indeed, it has arrived."
At Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., Robert Farrell, manager of the brokerage firm's market-analysis unit, said the dollar volume of net buying by odd-lot investors had risen sharply in the past two weeks.
The Dow Jones industrial average yesterday surged more than 20 points in the first hour's trading, then fell back somewhat. In the early afternoon it rallied once more, rising more than 24 points from the opening, and then cooled again, closing at 648.08, up 17.06 points from Wednesday. Big Board volume rose to 26,360,000 shares from Wednesday’s 18,820.000. That was the highest turnover since Dec 29, 1972, when 27,554,790 shares were traded.
Anthony Ludovici, analyst with Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day, said he thought the bottom may have been reached by certain groups of stocks, particularly interest-sensitive groups such as utilities, savingsand-loan associations, mortgage companies and the like. “But stocks in the industrial average could test new lows in the future," he added.
Other analysts also thought the industrial average could yet test new lows. “I’m convinced we're still in a bear market," said Charles Jensen, analyst with Merkin & Co. "The glamour stocks will lead the market upstairs when the time comes; but in yesterday afternoon's rally some of the glamours failed to reach their morning highs. They haven’t exhibited enough strength to take the initiative," he said.
Some Banks Lower Prime Rates
Brokers said the market apparently was encouraged by the fact that some banks, including Southwest Bank of St. Louis, yesterday lowered their prime, or minimum, lending rates to 11%% from li®i%. Yesterday morning, Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, following a recent industry move, lowered its prime fee to 11%% from 12%. but said it hasn’t any immediate plans to lower it another % percentage point.
In New York, the Federal Reserve Bank reported that business loans at major New York City banks rose $46 million in the week ended Wednesday, compared with an increase of $484 million the previous week. Some brokers have been watching the weekly loan figures for signs that loan demand might be easing.
In a sharp gain, the utility indicator rose 2.43 points, or 3.72%, to 67.68. The transportation indicator also posted a strong gain.
Indicative of the sweep of the market’s advance, advancing issues jumped to a better than eight-to-one lead over declining issues in the first hour of trading; but the gap narrowed somewhat in late trading and, at the close, advances led declines 1,338 to 261. Eight issues reached 1974 highs, however, compared with five the day before; 28 stocks reached 1974 lows, down from 58 on Wednesday.
The American Stock Exchange index also gained, closing at 66.91, up 1.37 points. Volume rose to 2,830,000 shares from Wednesday’s 1,830,000. Advances led declines about three to one.
The National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ index of over-the-counter stocks advanced 1.56 points to 59.13.
