Fresh signs that consumers aren't spending revived doubts about the broader economy, which sent stocks lower and hurt the price of oil.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 184.22 points, or 2.2%, to 8284.89, retracing nearly all its gains this month.
Banks, which led the market's surge in recent weeks, fell as more financial institutions raised capital and some investors took profits. Bank of America dropped 10%.
Oil futures slipped 1.4% to $58.02 a barrel. In the latest inventory data, imports of oil hit a 10-year low as refiners decided to draw down stockpiles rather than buy new oil, a sign they expect demand to remain weak.
The S&P 500-stock index declined 24.43 points, or 2.7%, to 883.92, hurt by declines in every sector. Its financial sector was down 5%. After recently breaking into the black for 2009, Wednesday's decline put it back in negative territory, off 2.1% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 51.73 points, or 3%, to 1664.19.
"We are certainly a lot more cautious than we were two or three weeks ago," said Jack McPherson, a portfolio manager with Eagle Boston Investment Management.
A series of reports raised concerns about consumer spending, a driver of economic growth. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 0.4% in April from the prior month, contrary to analysts' expectation for a slight gain.
Separately, a report by RealtyTrac showed that the number of U.S. households facing foreclosure jumped in April, and mortgage applications declined last week.
Investors scooped up government debt as a haven. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.103%.
