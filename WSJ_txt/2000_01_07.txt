The Nasdaq Composite Index, which is heavy with technology issues, took a severe beating last week, falling nearly 10% from its record high Monday. But the index ended the turbulent week on a positive note, rising 155.49 points, a one-day record gain for the index. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 3,882.62, up 4.17%. Smallcapitalization stocks also gained ground, with investors apparently choosing to ignore employment data that suggest higher interest rates may be in the offing. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks climbed 12.97, or 2.73%, to 488.31.
But Nasdaq stocks have been beaten down almost all week long on worries about overvalued technology stocks and the interest-rate outlook. By the time the data was released Friday morning, some investors decided that it was already priced into the Nasdaq, analysts said.
Ultimate Software Group lost 3/4, or 7.9%, to close at 8 3/4. After the close of the market Thursday, the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., maker of human-resource management and payroll software said it expects to report results of break-even to a loss of three cents a share for the fourth quarter, weaker than what the company previously anticipated. Ultimate Software cited a delay in closing certain year-end business due to year-2000 issues.

NEW YORK -- Tech stocks may have been down, but they're not out.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, which is heavy with technology issues, took a severe beating last week, falling nearly 10% from its record high Monday.

The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks climbed 12.97, or 2.73%, to 488.31.
The December jobs report was stronger than what had been anticipated, raising an inflationary warning that analysts say the Federal Reserve is likely to pay heed to when it meets in a few weeks.
