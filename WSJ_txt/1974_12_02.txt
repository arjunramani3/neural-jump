Abreast of the Market
By Gene G. Mabclal
A dismal economic outlook continued to depress the stock market yesterday
A "concentration ot bad economic” news has caused "investors to sit back and wait for the time being”. Lawrence Lewis, analyst for Pershing & Co., said.
The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 15.64 points to close at 603.02 in light trading. That was the average's sharpest one-day drop since it fell 22 69 points on Nov 18 to close at 624.92.
Uncertainty over when the coal strike might end continued to damp investor interest. analysts said Rank-and-file miners were scheduled to vote yesterday on a tentative settlement, but bad weather caused United Mine Workers President Arnold Miller to ask local unions to keep ballot boxes open through tomorrow.
Despite Mr. Miller's campaign for ratification, the proposed settlement might be rejected and this worries investors, analysts said. Prolongation of the coal strike, currently in its fourth week, could add to the severity and longevity of the recession.
Analysts also noted that the drop in short-term money market rales may have reached a temporary plateau. Yesterday. First National Bank of Chicago held its prime, or minimum, lending rate at 10%% for the second consecutive week. The bank’s prime fee is based on a formula tied to commercial paper rates and is reviewed weekly. Friday, First National City Bank said its 10% prime rate would remain unchanged. It was the first halt in Citibank's prime-rate cuts since early October, when the rate stood at 12%. Declining interest rates tend to stimulate the market.
New York Stock Exchange volume rose to 11,140,000 shares from Friday's 7,400,000. Friday’s turnover was the lowest since 7,373,000 shares were traded on Oct. 25, 1971.
Brokers noted that President Ford's scheduled press conference last night, in which he was to comment on the state of the economy, didn't have any impact on yesterday's market. "Ford's policy appears to be one of reaction rather than one of innovation” in dealing with the economy, Robert Mintz, research director of Muller & Co., said
Amex Index Fell
The American Stock Exchange index also fell, closmg at 62.68, off 1.07. Declines led advances nearly three to one. Volume rose to 1,540,000 shares from Friday's 1,050,000.
The National Association of Securities Dealers' NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter stocks dropped 1.29 points to 61.66.
The transportation index slumped 1.89 points and the utility indicator skidded 0.93 point.
On the Big Board, declines led advances nearly three to one at the outset, and the gap widened during the day. At the close, declines led 1,183 to 256.
No stocks reached new 1974 highs yesterday, while five touched new 1974 highs on Friday; 97 issues fell to new 1974 lows, up from 41 the previous trading day.
Analysts said there also was concern about the probability that unemployment will continue to increase. The November jobless figures, scheduled to be announced Friday by the Labor Department, are expected to show a sharp rise from October, they commented. Over the long Thanksgiving weekend, General Motors announced new auto-assembly cutbacks and layoffs of 62,000 during January.
Many glamour stocks were swept downward. Xerox tumbled 3% to 56%; Texas Instruments 3% to 70%; IBM 6% to 170%, and Schering Plough 4% to 52%.
Bond prices also fell. Long-term governments dropped about 12-32 point and, in over-the-counter trading, prime corporate issues tumbled about % point.
