Tech and financial stocks led the biggest rally in more than three months as an upbeat forecast from Intel and a drop in credit-card delinquencies helped restore investor confidence.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, including Intel, rose for a third day in a row, an overall 5.8% gain that recoups nearly a month's worth of losses. It gained 256.72 points, or 3.1%, Wednesday, to 8616.21, its biggest one-day gain in percentage terms since April 9.
Still, the Dow remains 2.1% below its recent high on June 12.
Intel jumped 7.3% after reporting strong sales and saying it expects strong revenue in the third quarter. Cisco Systems was up 5.8% and Microsoft rose 4.4%, helping the Nasdaq Composite Index rise 3.5%, its sixth consecutive gain and the longest winning streak since November.
As the market's gains piled up through the afternoon, the financial sector joining tech at the fore of the rally. The S&P 500 rose 3% to 932.68, its highest close in more than a month, led by a 4.3% gain in its financial category.
Credit-card issuers posted big gains after new data showed that delinquency rates fell throughout the industry in June. Capital One Financial was up 12%, American Express rose 11%, and Discover Financial Services was up 11%.
Treasury prices fell as investors returned to riskier investments. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 3.596%, the highest since June 24. The dollar fell 1.2% against the euro.
The dollar's decline and investors' renewed optimism helped send commodities prices higher. Still, second-quarter corporate-profit reports have only begun to trickle out, and investors are eager for the flood of reports due out later this week and next week, including Google, Bank of America and General Electric.
"This week will be one of the most important in terms of determining the market direction for the year," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
