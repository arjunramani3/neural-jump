"There’s no good news because in a sense, an interest-rate cut merely confirms that things are weakening,” said Nigel Cobby, who heads up the marketing of equity research at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. “Nobody wants to look at fundamentals anymore.”
On its own, the Fed’s monetary turnaround over the past 16 weeks, when it was still leaning toward higher rates, isn’t enough to push stock markets higher, analysts said. “A Fed rate cut helps because it takes out the panic, but it doesn’t change the fundamentals," said Paul Donovan, senior international economist at Warburg Dillon Read in London.
“It doesn't change the outlook for corporate earnings in tlie near term. It doesn't change the outlook for the Japanese banking crisis. It doesn’t change the move toward capital controls in Asia. It doesn’t sort out Latin America’s deficit problems, and it doesn't sort out weak levels of demand in Asia," Mr. Donovan said.
