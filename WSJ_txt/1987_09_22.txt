Industrial Average Advances 75.23 As Stocks Surge in Late Trading
ABREAST OF THE MARKET
By Tim Metz
Persistent bulls sensing the bottom of the latest stock market correction finally were right yesterday, and they triggered a runaway rally that catapulted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its largest one-day point gain ever. Trading was heavy.
In what seemed to be a solid, it unspectacular recovery from Monday's nearly 32-point slide, the industrial average was ahead slightly more than 17 points at 2 p.m. EDT. It was up more than 35 points at 2:30. more than 37 points at 3 p.m. and, with computer-assisted buy programs acting as an afterburner, it roared to a 6S.86-point gain by 3:30. The average closed at 256S.05, up 75.23 points. The previous record one-day rise. 69.89. occurred April 3 of this year.
In percentage terms, however, yesterday’s 3.02% gain in the industrial average barely nudged the 3.01% gain April 3 and didn't place anywhere near the top 100 percentage gains in history.
Initially, the rally was driven by a firmer dollar and bond market, and it gained force as both these other markets held and even improved their gains in the face of the tense Persian Gulf confrontation between the U.S. and Iran and nervousness over this weekend’s dollar talks among the U.S. and its major allies.
In midafternoon, when the price of the December Standard & Poor’s 500 futures contract advanced to a premium of nearly five full points above the value of the index itself, program traders jumped in with “about 20 to 25 buy programs." said Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette trader William Marcus.
Through much of yesterday's session, the number of New York Stock Exchange issues gaining in price and those declining were about the same, but gainers pulled away smartly in the final hour to end with a commanding 1.055-to-554 edge. Big Board volume surged to 209.5 million shares from Monday’s 170.1 million.
Some broad market indexes posted spectacular advances, too. although most of yesterday's fun was reserved for the blue-chip issues. The S&P 500 surged 8.96 to 319.50 and the New York Stock Exchange index rose 4.23 to 178.48. However, the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks gained only 1.89 to 437.90, and Nasdaq losers actually outnumbered gainers, 1,339 to 1,059.
Despite the big volume and huge point advance in the industrial average, the Big Board’s transactions ticker never fell behind the pace of trading yesterday. And the smooth pace gave some traders “an eerie feeling," said one. “It all seemed too easy to be real,” he said. “But you can’t deny numbers like these.”
“The bears finally climbed to the top of the ladder and fell off," said Gruntal & Co. technical analyst Gene Jay Seagle, who said the comparison between the latest correction and the one last spring was striking. "Both were relatively shallow-6% to 8%—and rapid, and both were accompanied by a very sudden and widespread rise in bearish sentiment." Mr. Seagle figures this sentiment will make plenty of stock available to the bulls, who he expects to drive the industrial average to at least 2850 by the end of the year.

Stan Weinstein, who publishes The Professional Tape Reader, a technically oriented market letter, said he was "convinced" that yesterday's reversal marked the end of the market correction.
Mr. Weinstein in mid-August had put out a short-term sell signal, less than two weeks before the industrial average’s Aug. 25 peak of 2722.42. But in last Friday’s weekly update of his recorded “hotline” service for clients, the Hollywood, Fla.based market analyst told them that any close of the industrial average above the 2545 level in the days ahead would confirm that the market’s short-term bottom had been reached.
“So I expect my clients will be in there buying the rest of this week." Mr. Weinstein said.
They aren't likely to be lonely. Market observers noted that yesterday's surge tripped technical signals for increased buying by the now-widespread “index funds"-portfolios that mirror the market averages. And. many other institutional investors, approaching the end of an otherwise undistinguished quarter, will be sorely tempted to add the newly sizzling blue-chip stocks to their holdings today, so their trades will be effective, or settled, by next Wednesday, Sept. 30.
Yesterday’s volume total was distorted by a tidal wave of trading in shares of Newmont Mining, the target of a hostile takeover attempt by a Boone Pickens-led group. Newmont on Monday announced it had amended an agreement with Consolidated Gold Fields to allow the British mining concern to expand its 26% stake in Newmont to 49.9%. Yesterday, amid traders’ reports that Wall Street professionals were the sellers and Consolidated Gold Fields was the buyer. Newmont rose 1 to 95 on volume of 18.9 million shares.
Among other heavily traded issues, IBM surged 5'4 to 155-14, American Telephone & Telegraph rose Uts to 33%, USX gained 1 '.i to 36%. General Electric spurted 2% to 62% and Exxon, which recently split its stock 2-for-l, jumped 2% to 49.
Only a handful of stock groups declined, with oil and oil service, communications, apparel and consumer products issues especially strong.
Among the oils. Chevron advanced 3% to 53%. Arco rose 4% to 91%, Texaco added % to 40’2. and Pennzoil gained 1% to 70%. Oil services and equipment gainers included Halliburton, which rose 1% to 39%, and McDermott, up % to 27.
Litton Industries, which lose 1% to 100%. and Westinghouse Electric, which added 2% to 69%, were advancers among electrical equipment makers.
