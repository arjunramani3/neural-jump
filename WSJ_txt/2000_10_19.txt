The bulls were back in town.
A day after the stock market's rout on Wednesday, and on the 13th anniversary of the 1987 stock-market crash, stocks staged an across-the-board rally.
The gains sent the Nasdaq Composite Index to its third-strongest percentage gain ever. Propelled by Microsoft's strong earnings report, the Nasdaq composite leapt 7.79%, or 247.04 points, to close at 3418.60.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which also includes Microsoft, jumped back above the 10000 mark, after falling below it on Wednesday.
Traders said they found the gain doubly amazing, since the Nasdaq index, dominated by beleaguered technology companies, had staged its second-strongest percentage gain just a week ago today. That gain, like yesterday's, was a snap-back after a series of daily pummelings.
"This could be the broadest technology recovery we have seen this year," said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, a subsidiary of State Street Corp. in Boston. He pointed to gains in almost every tech sector, from software to semiconductors to computers to networking to communications to Internet companies.
Although so-called defensive stocks such as drug makers pulled back, financial stocks, industrial stocks, airlines and many retailers joined in the fun. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1.68%, or 167.96 points, to 10142.98.
The catalysts? Three things, including Microsoft, said Matthew Johnson, who heads Nasdaq trading at Lehman Brothers.
The stock market's ability during the day on Wednesday to turn a potential price massacre -- the Dow industrials were down 435 points at one juncture -- into merely a sharp decline created strong upward momentum yesterday, as many investors hustled back into the market in case it finally was beginning a lasting rebound.
The return to stocks was accelerated by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said in a speech that oil prices weren't causing severe economic problems and that the nation's productivity boom was continuing.
But first on most traders' list was Microsoft, a company that some investors had written off and left for dead. Microsoft surprised the market after normal trading ended Wednesday by announcing a much stronger-than-expected third-quarter performance.
Microsoft soared almost 20% on the day, and pulled other tech bellwethers with it. Networking giant Cisco Systems surged 11%, and both Dell Computer and Intel advanced 10%.
"The market got a leader back in the form of Microsoft, a stock that hasn't been a leader for a number of months now," Mr. Johnson said. "I think a lot of people decided that the world wasn't coming to an end, and they decided to buy stocks."
Since the Nasdaq composite peaked on March 10, at 5048.62, a growing number of investors have been selling stocks and moving to cash deposits or bonds.
When the Nasdaq soared 7.87% last Friday, and then leapt another 7.79% yesterday, some decided the train was leaving the station.
"You had some people chasing and trying to catch up," said Larry Lawler, head of stock trading at Dreyfus Corp.
But he, like many other traders, cautioned that there isn't any guarantee that the reversals are over. "I'd like to see another day or two of this," he said. "I'm not sure we are completely out of the woods yet, but things definitely look a lot better."
The dollar fell back somewhat after setting another record against Europe's ailing euro on Wednesday. The U.S. currency advanced against the yen, and bonds rose.

Bulls Roar Back With Broad Rally; Tech Stocks Help Lift Nasdaq 7.8% - ProQuest
Many traders and professional money managers caution that the same factors that drove down stocks -- high oil prices, disappointing corporate earnings and a weak euro -- continue to be a plague. Some say the recent heart-stopping volatility may not be over.
In addition to staging two of its three biggest percentage gains in just the past five trading days, the Nasdaq composite's biggest percentage gain was also this year. The index soared 7.94% on May 30, as technology stocks were rebounding from weeks of punishment. Its biggest percentage loss took place during the 1987 crash (down 11.35%), but No. 2 on that list also was this year, in April. Recent gains have been punctuated by big losses.
Yesterday's rebound leaves the Nasdaq composite up 11.2% from its low for the year of 3074.68, set on Thursday of last week amid Mideast violence. The Nasdaq index is at its highest level in two weeks. But it still is down 32% from its March 10 record and down 16% for the year.
The Dow industrials, less severely hit, are 13% off their January record and down 12% for the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which jumped 3.47% yesterday, is down an even-more moderate 9% from its March high and off just 5% for the year.
Many investors consider the current rebound strong enough to continue for a while. But many also believe that the pullbacks probably aren't over.
"Microsoft is a great company, and it was probably depressed, but should it jump 20% in a day because the quarter was slightly better than expected and they gave a few encouraging comments?" asked Mr. Riley of State Street.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.29 billion shares traded, 1,943 stocks advanced and 920 declined.
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32, or 93.75 cents for each $1,000 invested, pulling the yield down to 5.648%. The 30-year bond was up 8/32 to yield 5.75%.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 84.33 cents to the euro and 108.18 yen to the dollar, weakening from 83.88 cents and strengthening from 107.86 yen.
