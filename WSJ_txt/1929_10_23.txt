LIQUIDATION AGAIN HITS STOCK MARKET
Co’ifintierf from first ties said they recognized considerable urgent selling in the last few minutes to improve balances. Some of this sort of thing was regarded as having occurred in Kennecott, Columbia Graphophone and, on the Curb, in Electric Bond & Share. The last sale in Kennecott, a block of 20,000 shares, was at 67, more than 7 points under the previous sale.
Bears, naturally, were again active, pointing attacks at high priced issues as well as the group of stocks in which a large Chicago element is interested. Though it appeared totally lacking, there were evidences of buying on scale in a number of leading issues. Among the major declines were 77 points in Auburn Motors, 70 m Commercial Solvents and 46 in Case.
