Sell signals from two influential forecasters helped knock a slack stock market jd’ff balance yesterday, sending the Dow atones Industrial Average to its biggest Jme-day point decline ever. The index fell <91.55 points to 2548.63.

Jn.8% plunge of Oct. 28, 1929. Market pro-'fessionals added that it was highly unlikely that yesterday's decline in itself spelled the end of the five-year bull market. In ■fact, the Dow has declined more than 4%— and risen more than 4%—on more than a .Hundred occasions, mostly in the 1930s.
But yesterday’s move, coming on a day when the bond market was up slightly and in the absence of any other salient piece of bad news, still created its share of anxieties. In particular, it served as a vivid reminder that stocks have remained at a
nigh level despite a pronounced six-weex decline in the bond market.
The higher interest rates that have weakened the bond market pose a longer-term threat to the U.S. economy because they raise the cost of borrowing for both businesses and consumers, and threaten the robust earnings prospects that have propelled the stock market to date.
Some observers also were unsettled by the fact that the drop was within nine points of becoming the Dow’s first 100-point move. “People are going to have to get used to this stuff," said Bill Harnisch, president of Forstmann Leff Associates, a New York money manager.
“It's unnerving to see this kind of volatility” in response to market forecasters alone without some change in fundamentals, added Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.
Effect of Newsletters
The sell signals credited with sparking yesterday’s decline came from Robert Prechter, who writes the Elliot Wave Theorist newsletter based in Gainesville, Ga., and Peter Eliades, editor of the Stock Market Cycles newsletter in Los Aneeles.
Mr. Prechter couldn’t be reached for comment, but traders said he had sent out a bulletin indicating that a decline below 2640 might presage a 300-point fall in the Dow Jones industrials. However, there was nothing to indicate that Mr. Prechter had changed his long-term forecast that the average will surpass 3000.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Eliades said it was a bad sign that the market couldn't stay above its average level for

the past 10 weeks after moving above it for a few days last week. He said the market needs to digest yesterday’s decline for a few days before regaining strength.
Although the bond market stayed firm yesterday, a bellwether West German interest rate rose a notch, and some traders said pressure was building for an increase in the prime rate, the interest benchmark used by big U.S. banks.
On the other hand, in a development that could have positive implications for the bond market, crude oil prices plunged yesterday on reports that Saudi Arabia is linking some of its crude-sale prices to spot market prices.
Susan Byrne, president of Westwood Management, a New York money manager, said that yesterday's move of greater than 3% is likely to cause more selling today as programs tied to portfolio insurance kick in. Such programs automatically sell stocks or stock-index futures when the market declines. “I would say the market is really jittery," she added.
All year, the stock market has been pulled upward by rising corporate earnings and downward by rising interest rates. Even at yesterday's close, the Dow Jones industrials were less than 200 points from their record close of 2722.42 set Aug. 25 and

650 points above their level at the start of this year.
In a recent report, Merrill Lynch & Co. economists estimated that earnings of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index would rise 15% in 1987 and 14% in 1988.
Meanwhile, the 7.5% Treasury bond due in November 2016, which was quoted at a bid price of 100 22/32 in early January, had fallen by mid-August to 86 10/32 and by midafternoon yesterday was quoted at 77 20/32, for a total decline of 23%. In the same period, the effective yield on the bond has risen from 7.43% to 9.82%.
One reason higher rates hurt stock prices is that they reduce the current value of a given level of future earnings and dividends. For example, with interest rates at 5%, a $1 dividend payable a year from now is worth about 95 cents today. But with interest rates at 10%. the same $1 dividend is only worth about 91 cents today.
As is often the case, the market's skid yesterday was led by stock-index futures. As big institutional investors turned bearish, traders said, they chose to sell index futures rather than individual equities. “The easiest way to quickly restructure a portfolio is with futures," explained Richard Sandor, a top futures official at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
With futures prices closing the day at an unusual discount to underlying stock prices, some traders predicted that stocks might take a further jolt at the start of trading today, until futures prices recovered.
In any case, yesterday's big move knocked the wind out of both professionals and small investors.
“This one really came out of the blue. I didn't expect it to be so bad,” said Edward Nicoski, a technical analyst at Piper Jaffray & Hopwood Inc., a brokerage in Minneapolis. At Kidder Peabody & Co., technical analyst Ralph Acampora said his staff “froze around 3 p.m. and just started watching the screens. Even the phones stopped ringing. We were watching history in the making.”
And at a Charles Schwab & Co. brokerage in downtown New York. Palmira Romero. a paralegal with the federal government, admitted bewilderment. “I thought the market was going to go up. actually." she said. Ms. Romero, who owns about $11,000 of such blue chips as General Electric Co. and BellSouth Corp., maintained: "Eventually they'll go back up again. I'm still, optimistic.”
