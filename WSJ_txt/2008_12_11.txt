The stock market stalled on weak economic news and worries that the Senate wouldn't approve the auto bailout. The dollar slid and oil surged, reversing two recent trends.
Major stock indexes held steady through midday but then slumped. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 196.33 points, or 2.2%, to 8565.09, hurt by declines in its manufacturing and financial components.
General Motors slid 10% as the House-approved bill to rescue auto makers came under fire in the Senate.
Declines in financial names accelerated after J.P. Morgan Chase CEO James Dimon said on CNBC that home prices could fall 20% from already depressed levels and painted a gloomy picture of the bank's prospects for 2009. J.P. Morgan shares fell 11%.
"A lot of people have been eager to call a bottom in the financials, but there's still a lot to be hashed through in that sector," said Chris Johnson, president of Johnson Research Group, an analysis and portfolio-management firm in Cincinnati.
Before trading began, the government reported that weekly unemployment claims hit a 26-year high.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2.9% to end at 873.59, led by an 8.1% slide in its financial sector.
Oil futures jumped 10% to $47.98 a barrel in New York, helped by a weaker dollar, rising expectations of a production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries next week, and unwinding of bearish bets made during oil's slide from its July record.
Treasury prices rose and yields fell. The yield on the two-year note, 0.801%, was the lowest in more than 35 years.
