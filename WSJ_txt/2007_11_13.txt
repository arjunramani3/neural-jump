"Maybe the credit-market asset write-offs are pretty much all on the table," said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "The sense is that this problem is going to go away sooner or later."
The rally picked up steam as the afternoon wore on. "We've got a lot of money on the sidelines, and bond yields are not appealing," said Mr. Goldman.
The question now is how long the rally can last. "It's probably a day for the market to take a step back to assess," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "This is a very choppy market, and I will be surprised if we have a one-direction of market movement that lasts very long."

Good news from big banks, signs that consumers haven't put away their wallets and a drop in oil prices combined to send stocks soaring after four straight days of losses.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 319.54 points, or 2.5%, to 13307.09, recovering nearly half the 673 points it lost in the previous four sessions. The blue-chip average is up 6.8% in 2007, though 6.1% below its record close of 14164.53 on Oct. 9.
It was the second-biggest point and percentage gain this year, after a 336-point, or 2.5% gain on Sept. 18. Financial stocks led the rise. Citigroup rose 6.9% after it said it was reorganizing its investment bank.
Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group, said the Wall Street firm wouldn't have write-offs from mortgage-related investments in the fourth quarter, sending its shares up 8.5%.

Technology stocks, which had taken a drubbing after this year's big gains and concerns about the impact of slowing economic growth on spending, also rebounded as investors saw bargains. The Nasdaq Composite Index leapt 3.5%, or 89.52 points, to 2673.65, up 10.7% this year. Apple led the charge, rising 10.5% following reports that it is in talks with China's biggest wireless carrier to offer its iPhone in China.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.9%, or 41.87 points, to 1481.05, up 4.4% this year.
Wal-Mart Stores reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, and its shares rose 6.1%. Home Depot, which benefited during the now- ended housing boom from customers' appetite to add decks, swimming pools and the like to their residences, issued disappointing results. Still, its shares rose 2.3%.
The drop in oil futures, of $3.45, or 3.7%, to $91.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, came after the International Energy Agency reduced world-wide demand forecasts.
It was the biggest dollar drop for a near-term futures contract since December 2004. Although oil futures are up 49% this year, the price has fallen 5.7% since last Tuesday.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks rallied. Total trading volume for stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange was 4.1 billion shares, as 2,726 stocks advanced and 595 fell.
Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury note lost 8/32, or $2.50 for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield up to 4.256%. The 30-year bond was down 4/32 to yield 4.608%.
The dollar was mixed. It traded at 110.89 yen, up from 109.67, while the euro rose against the dollar to $1.4602 from $1.4539.
