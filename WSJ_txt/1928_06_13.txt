Rally Develops
Stocks Stage Vigorous Recovery from Tues' day's Break—Call ZSIoney 6%
Stocks Tallied yesterday, reflecting an improved technical position m the general list. After nine consecutive days of decline without a rally of importance, it was evident that the market had reached a stage where considerable adjustment of overextended speculative accounts had taken place.
Tuesday’s sweeping break op a record’ turnover of more than 5.000.000 shares fairly well cleaned up necessitous liquidation immediately overhanging the market. As a matter of fact, this sharp drop brought industrials used m the Dow-Jones averages down 18 points from the June 2 high, a setback which was fully as drastic as the initial stages of the memorable shake-out of February-March. 1926.

On precedent, therefore, the market was entitled to at least a technical recovery. While a large amount of leftover liquidation appeared during the morning, improvement in the main body of stocks steadily gathered momentum.
For a tame it appeared that call money might advance to 6X=%. from the renewal charge of 6%. But this stiffening was prevented by the recent wholesale cleaning out of poorly margined accounts which substantially reduced the demand for speculative credit.
When it became evident that sufficient funds were available at 6rr. the rally developed marked aggressiveness. Good-sized rebounds from Tuesday’s lows took place m Steel, General Motors. American Can and other leaders of the industrial category.

New York Central advanced sharply on announcement of the sale of its Mohawk Valley and New York State Railways holdings to a big power group at a price which should materially assist the road’s electrification program
Latter consideration brought active buying into General Electric. American Telephone led a vigorous rally in seasoned dividend issues and the whole market displayed a strong tone through the afternoon.

Institutional as well as large investment interests were the principal purchasers of Consolidated Gas on the break below 140 m Tuesday's wave of selling. Scale orders on the buying side were concentrated around that level. Selling was largely scattered, indicating that Consolidated Gas passed into fewer and stronger hands on the decline.
One of the stocks m which scale buying was strongly in evidence was Montgomery Ward, which rallied about 6 points from Tuesday’s low. Some time ago people familiar with Ward’s affairs felt that a reaction in the general market was overdue, and scale support was put in. from 140 down. Buying was of a confident nature so far as Montgomery Ward’s prospects were concerned, being premised on the upward swing of business indicated by the gain of 15.5% in sales last month, and the experience of the vastly greater increase in profits which such a sales improvement brings about.
“Settlement of political and credit problems, we have maintained for some time,” says Jackson Brothers, Boesel & Co., “would have to be effected before readjustment in the stock market could be regarded as completed. We are now well along the way to see credit problems straightened out through forced liquidation. Political problems should be clarified in the next few days, with all indications pointing to the unanimous selection of Hoover as the presidential candidate.
“Situation prompts these conclusions: First, holders of high-grade industrials and railroad securities who are in position to protect their holdings should not sacrifice them now. Second, purchases of the highest grade of industrial and railroad stocks should be bought on any further weakness which may develop. Third, holders of second and third rate securities should scan their lists carefully with a view of switching into the highest grade of stocks.’*
Weekly steel trade reviews reported, a cautious attitude on the part of consumers, with production declining but prices holding on the whole fairly well to established levels. At the same time an effort on the part of the trade to advance third quarter quotations on heavy products $1 a ton is not making much headway.
It was pointed out that mill operations are holding above the level of both last year and 1926, the record production period; that although consumers are buying only their immediate needs specifications are supporting a fairly high rate of operations, for th* time of the year
when summer dulness is expected.
