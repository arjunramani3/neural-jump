Stocks mounted an afternoon rally to close near the day's highs as investors awaited monthly jobs data for more guidance on the fragile economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 50.63 points, or 0.49%, at 10320.10, hanging on to Wednesday's blockbuster gains and extending its winning streak to three days. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.06%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.91%.
Better-than-expected housing and retail data provided some encouragement to investors, but caution prevailed as the market treaded water between Wednesday's big runup and Friday's monthly jobs numbers.
John Canally, economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial, said recent data had taken some fire out of those predicting an economic double dip.
"The mood has shifted," he said, "the burden of proof is back on the double dippers."
Retailers led the small climb after back-to-school sales for August beat expectations. Home builders also gained on modest improvement in the housing sector, while disappointing U.S. factory orders and a continued stream of jobless claims pointed to lingering economic overhangs.
"We need to see more consistent, positive economic reports," said Stephen Carl, head trader for Williams Capital in New York. Until then, "things are going to be choppy," he said, predicting more downside risk to the downside.
The Dow traded in a tight range for most of the day amid muted volumes, but broke higher in the last half hour as cyclical stocks led. Defensive sectors including utilities, telecom and health-care lagged.
The euro edged up after the European Central Bank kept its key interest rate unchanged, as expected. Treasurys fell again. Gold rose $5.20 an ounce to $1,251.50, less than $6 below its record high set in June. Gold is up nearly 20% from its low earlier this year.
