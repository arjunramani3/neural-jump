The Tres-ident’.- message was the dominating influence in the stock market. It came late in the day, and the first hurried interpretation left a {rood imp’tssion m Wall Street. Trader.- a”d the public rushed in to buy both industrials and rails, and tlir market appeared very buoyant In the body of the long address, however, there was found a hidden paragraph relating t" price-fixing, and when this was unearthed Wall Street changed its point of vi*?w. Recalling the old fears inspired by Governmental price-fixing, traders took advantage of their opportunity, and offered stocks freely. The result was a slashing of price- and large net declines. The paragraph in the President’ address which caused all the trouble reads as follows: ’‘Recent experience has convinced me that the Congress must go further in authorizing the Government to set limits to prices. The law of supply and demand. I am sorry to say. ha* been replaced by the law of re-trained selfishness. While we have eliminated profiteering in govern1 branches of industry, it still run- impudently rampant in others.”
President Wilson*** attitude on price-fixing, if approved bv Congress, might result in the reviving of the Pomerene bill, which was introduced in the Senate at the last ses-ton. and which cadcd for price-fixing on steel, iron, and all their constituent products under force of law. This is naturally not a favorable prospect for the financial community. Mr Wilson*.* suggestions a^ regards the pooling of manufactures for foreign fade were interpreted favorably, on the other hand, hut were overweighed bv the suggestion- of price-fixing. Legislation tending to off-et the Sherman law would be viewed as constructive.	,	.	_
Among the day’s developments wn* a reduction o. Kennecott Copper’s quarterly dividend. This 1* only on • of* the series of cigh* or more copner companies whi-n will meet '01 dividend action this month and other reduction- may he expected.

Anntner favorable turn was tho placing of a S20.000.-0<)0 onler for motor truck- with tho W?Jvs-Overland ( o.

XVeakneas in Rock Island Issues
Extreme dulness ruled during the second hour. Many specialties showed big losses on a small turnover. Special wcakne*- developed in Rock Island issues, and the preferred stock- went to new low records. Rock Island We stock sol * at 39. off 2%. and the 7% issues sold at 49X£, off 2. Rock Island common lost % to 17 Xi. Smaller earnings prohablv attributed to tho decline. The original shareholders of Rock Island who put up the $40 assessment and obtained 7% preferred stock to the amount of the asses-ment now have a loss of over 50% in their new stock and their common stock also shows, a decline. This shrinkag. is one of the worst that has come to light in reorganized railroad properties. In the nine months of the calendar year Rock Island’s net earnings decreased $l/‘4L*.OOn. Directors v*. ill probably meet for consideration of dividends this month.	’

D< duration of the H’% cash dividend in place of an announcement covering all the S2*% bark dividend* was the immediate cause for tho selling Persistent strength of Marine preferred m Monday’s market had caused holders to expect the carrying out of the original plan.*.

An En*cnible of Unfavorable Developments
War nous which developed overnight gave market fclloweis concern. The Bol*nevik' succeeded in bringing about an armistice on th? Russian front and have apparently disregarded the objection- made by the United States. Purlin reports that Rumania ’s seeking an armistice and tl.oie are hints that a di*cu*sioh with Germany is already unde) way. Tho British me. with more reverse* on the we-'t front and lost many mon and guns. A Romo di-pntch -tat'.d that a now Gorman-Austriun drive on tl‘.< Italian front was anticipated. ’Io these factors was u<t<led th*' statement of Secretary Baker hinting that Germany v.u* pieptirtng a new winter offensive and large military opetations “somewhere in Europe”. Partly offsetting thc-e factors was the new? that the populace in Vienna recently made a Ing peace demonstration and that a plan of unity had been worked out nt tho Allied XX ar Conference in Taris.
Charles Hayden on Copper
Market adopted a waiting attitude and trading was on a light scale al! through the first hour. There was good inquiry for Anaconda, which advanced % to .>7:4. Charles Hayden is authority for the statement that if the copper market had been left to take care of itself the price today would be 40 cents a pound. The demand largely exceeds tho supply, he says, and adds that an over supply is not likely to be realized during the war.
General Electric Has Support
Marine preferred continued its irregular course. After selling to a high of 94%, it dipped to 93, witnin a fraction of the low. Goodrich gained % to 38. Continental Can gained % to 95. General Electric had some evidence of banking support. Pennsylvania, Reading, and Canadian Pacific were weak.
Complications in Mercantile Marine
Declaration of a 10T cash dividend on International Morcant’le Murine prefer!ed leaves 72% m back dividends on this stock. Difli<-nlti<-s facing the committee whicn bad the readjustment plan under consideration were such u.-to make a complete funding plan impossible at this time It govs without saying that a funding plan must now be postponed for a lone time and the old mysteries of Marine preferred will prob ibly be exploited again in tne fu-tuir. That a 107r d.wdend would be declared was forecast exclusively by Dow, Jones & Co. Points to remember in connection with the Marine Co. arc these: Earnings have fallen off to a very large extent in the last six months and since October 15 the ships of the company flying the American flag have been lun for Government account. The undivided surplus in the subsidiary companies is not nv.ulab’o now for dividends to the holding company and much of the assets have already been used up in the recent payment of $30,000,000 International Mercantile Marine Co. bonds. The cash in the New York treasury will bo nearly depleted with the payment on December 31 of the lty% dividend.
