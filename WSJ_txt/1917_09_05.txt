STRONG AND ACTIVE
Karly los««e» especially in investment shares--Recoveries about noon lead to substantial grains for the day in most issues Itej>orts of more liberal price-fixing-Steels,
('oppers and Marines lead in recovery -Most rails also show strength—-Close strong.
Sales. 1 .O7f>.5<>O sharers.
Another wave of liquidation reached Wall Street at the opening of rhe market and thia was not checked until pood news came from Washington with respect to taxation and price-fixing. It appeared that the Sinunonp Bill would pass the Senate in the present form and it appeared further that the Government would allow a basic price of $6S a ton for steel,	for pjg iron and 25 cents a pound
for copper. These influences were constructive and bears rar. to cover. The rise in quotation- became quite us pronounced as the earlier declines.
It is no secret that some alarm	expressed in fi-
nancial circles over the course of events in the Street during the lust veek. It was feared that the Government was not pursuing a saf-* course in preparation for the large Government bond offering; that it was intimidating investors rather than encouraging them. An advance of money rate*. u> 6*< did not helu nuxtters. It was said that prominent liankors used their personal influence to obtain deposits of large funds of Government money in New York banks. Funds were deposited and this action tended to steady interest rates.
For a while, prices were slaughtered again m good investment issues Pennsylvania Railrosid stock, for instance. sold on better than a G'U yield basis, and reached the lowest price in twentv-two years. At its previous low. moreover, the stock was on a 5«> instead of the present 6*, dividend basis. The sacrificing of values, a« evidenced in the case of Pennsylvania, naturally impaired confidence in the market :is a whole. Stock raiders took advantage of the situation and made their best play in the industrials.
Opening Erratic and' Lower
Tho m.fket was erratic at rhe opening. Wtd*» fluctuation'- nin*k<d sales in the first few minutes Some stock'- gained fractionally, and others in the same class lost more ground
The raiding of Tuesday was credited in part to Waldorf operators, and in part tn big speculators who are summering in the Adirnnduc k*. Pressure such as developed Tuesday was ngair tn evidence shortly after the opemng.

tax bill *jb a whole. The division fxx the Senate has son and La Follette amendments will not be broken on become very marked on the tax question. The radicals have been squelched. They may come out anew from “time to time with views on the conscripting d wealth* but their influence is no longer dangerous. The third amendment offered by La Follette, providing for a tax of 60% on war profits* received 18 votes* thus showing no gain over the first amendment* which provided for a total of 80% in taxes on war profits. If t3xe United States raises $2,500,000,000 in taxes this year, she will have done -more than England did bv taxation in three years.	*
Government Support of Money Market Gives Strength
Call money renewal rates dropped to 4% in the noon hour and this announcement stimulated the buying movement in stocks. The report was in circulation on the Stock Exchange floor that a group of bankers after the close on Tuesday had importuned Treasury officials at Washington to deposit large funds in the New York banks. This report was not confirmed, but it is a fact that the Federal Reserve has turned over a large sum of money to the banks. At leading banks it was stated that there had not been any heavy calling of loans and that securities were welcomed as collateral at present prices.
In the buying movement the steel stocks and Marine shares were very* active.
Report of More Liberal Price-Fixing Helps Market
Announcement by Dow, Jones &, Co. of steel and copper prices rallied the market in the early afternoon trading. The prices of 25 cent? for copper and $68 a ton for steel and S3R for pig iron, while not official, are believed to be the figures which will be announced by Washington shortly. The published reports were credited in the financial district, and were supplemented by similar reports which reached various houses over private wires.
Steel common and Bethlehem E each rallied 3 Vi points from the low of the day. Central Leather and Great Northern Ore were also strong features. The entire list with, exception of Distillers, responded favorable to the news developments.
Rumors of Liquidation of Rail Collateral on Foreign Loans
Reports were current that the violent decline in rail stocks in tho lust few days was due, in a me^s^re, to liquidation of collateral under foreign government loans placed in this country in the last year.
It is worthy of attention that the loan of $94,500,000 three-ycar 5*7 collateral gold notes nlnced by the American Foreign Securities Co was secured by American stocks which included Atchison. Northern Pacific. Southern Pacific, Canadian Pacific. Great Northern, and Union Pacific common and pre ferrod.
The 8:»0b.0<H» 000 r. and 5-year 5%Cr British loan placed a y eat age ha»l a nrov.sion that tho British Government might -ell securities pledged under the loan and use proceed- U, retire note*? by purchase or redemption. It is believe*’ that an official announcement would have been me.de if redemption were considecrd-
Collatoral behind the $100 000.000 2-year 5%n- French Government loan placed bu.t February included Atchison, Baltimore A- Ohio. St Paul. Chicago North Western, Delaware A- Hudson. Canadian Pacific. Great Northern, Illinois Central I.**h'gh Valiev. LouisvUie &'Nashville. New York Central. Norfolk A- V.’<stem. Northern Pacific. Pennsylvania. Reading. South* n> F«u Hie. Union Pacific and Soo preferred stocks.
Strong and Active
In the rlosinr hour stocks were rushed up quickly under the leadership of sV'el and copper shares. Steel gained 4 u. points from the low and Lackawanna 4 points. Utah ga.ned 6 and Anaconda 5N.
To’swo Products was a weak spot, jaelhng ofT to and then recovering to 70. Distillers remained weak. United Cigar Stores was stronger.
Pittsburgh Coal gained two points between sales, and there were erratic movements also in Atlantic, Gulf & We<t Indies and Th*» equipments
The upward turn was attributed largely to short covering. neres«itaxed bv the good news from Washington on price fixing. Word wa« passed around the floor that stock- were a purchase, and there was unusual enthusiasm on the Exchange.
