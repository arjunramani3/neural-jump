NEW YORK -- The options market's fear gauge rose as stocks sagged under the weight of more geopolitical worries, including a missile test in North Korea, news reports of activity at a nuclear-power plant in Iran and preparation for possible war against Iraq.
But the rise was fairly muted, traders said, largely because many investors have been bracing for such instability. Many investors have bought out-of-the-money index puts to hedge their portfolios, or out-of-the-money calls to position for a rally, and continue to wait out the uncertainty on the sidelines.
As the major stock indexes tested or fell below their Feb. 13 lows, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's market-volatility index increased 2.20 to 37.85. But the index is shy of the 40 mark, a short-term resistance level it topped Feb. 13. Other sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios for stock and index options were neutral.
Nextel Communications' options saw active trade after an analyst downgraded the stock and as jittery investors pared back their holdings following large losses recently reported by European telecommunications companies Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.
In 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Nextel fell 90 cents to $11.26. Its March 12.50 puts traded 6,181 contracts, compared with open interest of 11,930 contracts, and gained 70 cents to $1.40 at the International Securities Exchange. The April 12.50 calls traded 4,132 contracts, compared with open interest of 4,357 contracts, and fell 25 cents to 55 cents at the Pacific Exchange.
Puts traded actively in Amazon.com, whose stock price is hovering not far from its 52-week high set in early December. From the bid and ask prices, it appears some investors were focused on buying July 20 puts, which provide downside insurance through mid-July should the online retailer's stock weaken.
In 4 p.m. Nasdaq trading, Amazon fell nine cents to $22.88. Its July 20 puts rose 15 cents to $1.55 as 4,490 contracts traded at the CBOE, compared with open interest of 2,204 contracts. An additional 2,051 contracts traded at other exchanges.
Many investors also picked spots to sell calls against stocks, essentially to earn premiums while defining prices at which they will be willing to sell stock.
In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, General Electric fell 69 cents to $23.61. Its September 30 calls traded 12,330 contracts, compared with open interest
of 5,972 contracts, and fell 10 cents to 40 cents at the Pacific Exchange. Credit: Dow Jones Newswires Word count: 405 Copyright Dow Jones & Company Inc Mar 11, 2003 More like this		n
