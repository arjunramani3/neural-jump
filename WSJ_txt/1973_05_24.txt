Abreast of the Market
Industrial Average Spurts 29.42 Points to 924.44 On News of Possible Easing of Dividend Curbs
By Dan Dorfman
Enthusiastic investors, setting aside fears about Watergate, at least temporarily, sent the stock market surging yesterday to its biggest one-day gain in the past 21 months in brisk trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average, ahead more than 17 points at 3 p.m., zoomed another 12 points in the last half hour of trading. That speedy explosive addition to the rally was ignited by a late report that the Nixon administration was considering easing guidelines on dividend boosts. Later, it was learned that the administration had considered such a move but had rejected it for the time being. “Hallelujah,” said one exuberant Shearson Hammill broker. “Maybe the country isn’t going to pot.”
The final count showed a huge gain of 29.42 points in the industrial average, which closed at 924.44. It was the biggest boost since the spectacular rise of 32.93 points in the industrial average on Aug. 16, 1971. That surge followed the administration’s announcement of the wage-price controls program.
Yesterday’s was a broad-based advance, with advances swamping declines, 1,187 to 349, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
The extent of yesterday’s surge caught Wall Street’s professionals by surprise. Shrugged off was the boost in the prime, or key, lending rate by a number of leading banks to 7%% from 7%.
Said a thoroughly amazed Robert H. Stovall, vice president of Reynolds Securities: “It’s hard to believe ... but it wouldn’t shock me to see the market (the industrial average) run up to 970 in a hurry. That would mean recouping about half the 160-point loss we’ve ha din the last 4% months. I think the rally also has to impress even the most ferocious bears, and I look today for a lot of short covering (replacing borrowed shares).”
In yesterday’s robust showing, the industrial average recouped nearly 20% of its loss since early January.
Glamours Scored Big Gains
Dramatic gains were scored by numerous stocks, sparked by the big-name glamour issues (see below) and oil securities.
In the glamour sector, for example, IBM roared ahead 10%; Texas Instruments soared 9; Avan Products rocketed ahead 4%, and Burroughs jumped 9%.
In the energy-related area, Standard Oil of California spurted 3; Atlantic Richfield leaped 3%, and Exxon climbed 2%.
Du Pont, the beneficiary of a renewed buy recommendation from a top research house, rose 6%. Ford raced ahead 4%. General Motors was another big winner, advancing 3. Record mid-May U.S. auto sales was an important stimulus.
But it wasn’t good news for all stocks. Early in yesterday’s session, it was reported that the U.S. experienced its first trade surplus in 19 months in April. That news, which helped spark the early rally, also strengthened the dollar abroad and damped somewhat the immediate enthusiasm for gold. And gold stocks suffered because of it. Dome Mines tumbled 5; American South African plummeted 3%; Campbell Red Lake dropped 2ya, and Homestake Mining was off 3.
A harried Michael Bloomberg, a block trading partner at Salomon Brothers, who was interrupted repeatedly by phone calls, reported steppedup institutional activity as the day wore on—even if it meant paying more for a stock. However, he said: “I’m still bothered about Watergate and inflation.”
One source on the Big Board’s trading floor credited short covering with helping to fatten the day’s gain. He added: “I think more than a few specialists were marking up stock prices rather liberally, and that surely made the gains look good."
With institutions more buy-minded, Big Board volume yesterday rose to 17,310,000 shares from Wednesday’s 14,950,000-share turnover. Block trades of 10,000 shares or more, rose to 114 from Wednesday’s revised total of 103.

TRADING ACTIVITY
Volume of advancing stocks on N.Y.S.E.. 13,750X100 shares; volume of declining stocks, 2,260X100. On American S.E.. volume of advancing stocks, 1,920X100; volume of declining stocks, 800X100.
Trades of 10X100 shares or more on N.Y.S.E., Wednesday, May 23, 1973, totaled 103 (revised).
There was a large number, 191, of new 1973 lows yesterday, probably reflecting early weakness in the session before the market turned upward. Six issues achieved new highs.
The market’s vigor also was reflected on the American Stock Exchange. Its index rose 0.14 to 22.57, as advances outpaced declines 585 to 302. However, Amex volume dropped to 3,320,000 shares from 3,480,000 shares on Wednesday.
Whether the rally will continue is questioned by some brokers. While it’s believed that yesterday’s surge helped correct what some regarded as the “oversold condition” of the market, there’s still strong concern about the strength of the 1974 economy. A better assessment of next year's business outlook, it’s believed, isn’t likely to occur until some time this fall. One respected brokerage house. White, Weld & Co., is projecting as much as a 10% decline in 1974 profits.
Yesterday’s broad advance was graphically reflected in the Dow Jones industrial average, where all 30 components registered gains. Among leaders were Eastman Kodak, up 8; General Electric, 2%; Sears Roebuck, 2%; Allied Chemical, 1%, and Union Carbide, 1%.
Phillips Petroleum Surged
Phillips Petroleum, top gainer on the Big Board's active roster, surged 2% to 50%. A participant in North Sea exploration, Phillips' shares hit a record 50%.
The second-biggest gainer among actives was Winnebago, which rebounded 1% to 7%. The motor home producer’s shares had come under recent pressure after it estimated a sharp drop in first quarter net.
Helena Rubinstein was one of the top percentage gainers, climbing 5% to 36%. The cosmetics concern and Colgate-Palmolive, which fell 2% to 87%, tentatively agreed on a tax-free acquisition of Helena Rubinstein by Colgate.
Another good gainer was Mountain Fuel Supply, which announced a flow of oil and gas from an exploratory well. The stock jumped 3% to 76.
Short covering also was cited as contributing to some of the gains on the American exchange. In active trading, TelePrompTer climbed 1% to 17% and Syntex 1% to 66%.
Also in the plus column, Jewelcor, which said Source Capital, formerly SMC Investment Corp., withdrew its requested registration of Jewelcor shares, gained 1% to 10%.
Gainers led losers 850 to 517 in NASDAQ-reported over-the-counter trading. Activity quickened a bit to 6,425,300 shares from 6,289,800 on Wednesday. American Express jumped 5% to 56, Rank Organisation % to 10%.
