"[Large companies] are still trading at high multiples to what they can earn, and that's a big overhang," said Kevin Kelly, chief investment officer at Recon Capital Partners.

Renewed worries over slowing overseas growth sent U.S. stocks tumbling anew, dashing hopes that last week's market turbulence had abated.
Energy stocks bore the heaviest selling, giving back recent gains, as oil prices resumed their decline. Shares of small companies, which tend to be more domestically focused, also were caught up in the downdraft, underscoring how investors are becoming worried that weakness in China could seep into the U.S. economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 469.68 points, or 2.8%, to 16058.35. Nearly nine billion shares changed hands, making it the seventh-busiest day for stock-market volume this year.
Stocks have been pummeled in recent sessions by fears that growth in China has hit the skids. Those concerns resurfaced Tuesday after manufacturing data out of China fell to its lowest level in three years. Those worries are following the worst earnings season for U.S. corporate-profit growth in years.
"[Large companies] are still trading at high multiples to what they can earn, and that's a big overhang," said Kevin Kelly, chief investment officer at Recon Capital Partners.
The S&P 500 lost 58.33 points, or 3%, to 1913.85. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 140.40 points, or 2.9%, to 4636.10. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks declined 31.40 points, or 2.7%, to 1128.05.
Earnings for the S&P 500 are on track to fall 0.8% in the second quarter, according to FactSet. That would mark the first year-over-year decline in quarterly earnings since 2012. The S&P 500 traded at 17.2 times the last 12 months of earnings as of last Friday, according to FactSet. That compares with a long-run average price/earnings ratio of 15.7. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 fell 3.7%. Oil tumbled 7.7%, to $45.41 a barrel, snapping a three-day rally.
