Stock Prices Plunge A Record 39 Points In Sharp Turnabout
Hectic Late Trading Erases New High Set on Tuesday; Effect of ‘Sell Programs’
Bond Market Triggers Drop
Wall Street laid an egg yesterday, only a day after traders were crowing over another new high
After soaring to a record Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suddenly plunged yesterday afternoon. It dropped 39.10 points on the day-the biggest one-day decline in history, though far less in percentage terms than the 38.33-point drop Oct. 28, 1929.
The slide in stock prices apparently was set off by a drop in the bond market yes-

terday morning (see page 33). Bond traders blamed the decline in their market on a government report of an unexpectedly large increase in civilian employment in December (see page 3). The employment gains suggested that the economy is strengthening, and thus that the Federal Reserve isn’t under any pressure to reduce interest rates
Contributing to the selling was a statement yesterday by Henry Kaufman, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc , who predicted that interest rates wouldn't drop any further unless the economy weakens.
"Henry Kaufman has such an august presence (in the market) that many investors just sold and decided to think” later, says Peter Canelo, an investment strategist at Bear, Stearns & Co
The dimming outlook for lower interest rates apparently shattered the recent,

widespread expectations that the Fed would soon cut its discount rate, the fee it charges banks and savings institutions for loans
Lower interest rates are favorable for stock prices because they both spur corporate profits and reduce the competition from fixed-income investments.
Once stocks caught the chill from the bond market, the sell-off built up its own momentum and ignored a partial recovery by bond prices late in the afternoon Programmed Sales
Securities analysts explained that the falling stock prices kicked off so-called programmed stock sales by major securities firms Such sales are part of complex trading strategies involving both stocks and stock-index futures and are keyed to price disparities between the two markets. Programmed trades often involve several hundred different stock issues and millions of dollars, and they are prearranged to hit the market simultaneously when triggered by specific price movements A fairly new stock market phenomenon, programmed trading has been heavily criticized in some quarteis as increasing the market's volatility
In the final hour of trading yesterday, it was "sell program after sell program. It just fed on itself," says Martin Krouner, the head of the block-trading desk at L.F Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbm in New York
The plunging prices rattled many traders and investors, who had euphon-

Other Indexes
Other indexes also fell sharply yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 5 83 to 207.97, and the New York Stock Exchange’s composite index slipped 2.94 to 120.20.
Trading on the Big Board was heavy all day and totaled 180,330,000 shares, the fifth highest on record.
In Chicago, public commodity funds and professional traders took heavy losses as Treasury-bond futures plummeted from records, helping to send stock-index futures into a tailspin in chaotic trading (see page 34). In the selling frenzy, traders were literally falling out of the Treasurybond futures pit on the Chicago Board of Trade.
“What a day like today does is scare the hell out of everybody,” says James G. Marquez, a New York money manager who invests primarily for his own account.
But one day's drop, no matter how spectacular, doesn't necessarily mean the bull market is over, William Priest, a portfolio manager at BEA Associates Inc. in New York, was one of many investors cautioning against making snap judgments.

Oops! Stock Market Plummets
Record 39 Points in Hectic Day

Continued from first rage a lot of hindsight that you know what really happened,” he said. “Right now, all you’ve got is a bunch of noise."
For investors not involved in program trading. Mr. Marquez believes that yesterday’s decline creates a buying opportunity, since neither earnings nor interest rates motivate such trading. “You’ve been given a gift." he said.
The program trading was kicked off when the price of the March futures contract on the S&P 500 index, traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, plummeted. The futures contract fell a whopping 3.6%. compared to a 2.7% decline in the actual cash index yesterday. Mainly that reflected massive futures selling by Salomon Brothers and other well-known Wall Street program traders, market sources said.
The selling binge actually drove the March futures contract from its usual niche at a premium to the cash index to a discount.
The severe drop in futures prices made it lucrative for arbitragers to buy 'futures and sell a related basket of stocks. For example, Jonathan P. Wolff, head of stockindex trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said he initiated such an arbitrage position that gave him an annualized 6'4% profit edge over simply owning the basket of stocks.
While yesterday’s trading featured extensive selling of stocks for technical futures-related reasons, some futures traders were again adamant that they were reacting to rather than causing the tidal wave of selling that swept stocks.
"This market was created by economic data-the ‘disco fever’ people went running,” Mr. Wolff said. He explained that he believes “there’s been too much buying in both the bond and stock markets in anticipation of a discount rate cut.”
Among individual stocks yesterday, International Business Machines, a favorite choice among investors who want to raise cash quickly, tumbled 6% to 148% on more than 1.9 million shares. Other technology stocks also fell: Burroughs dropped 2 to 62'4; Cray Research declined 214 to 61%; and Digital Equipment slid 5 to 133%.
With the bond market in trouble, interest-rate sensitive stocks, such as bank, savings and loan association, insurance and utility issues, were hard hit. Chase Manhattan Bank fell 2 to 75% after climbing 374 Tuesday; J.P. Morgan dropped 2'4 to 63% and Bankers Trust moved down 1% to 74%. The Dow Jones Utility Average fell
4.31	to 174.75.
Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only one advanced. F.W. Woolworth gained '4 to 59%. Other retailing issues were substantially lower- J.C. Penney tumbled 274 to 53; May Department Stores dropped 2'4 to 61%; Sears declined 2% to 36; K mart fell % to 34%.
Toys “R” Us moved down 1% to 33 74. Wertheim analyst Robert Schweich lowered his 1986 earnings estimate to $1.85 a
share from $2, but he’s continuing to recommend the stock.
Merrill Lynch fell 1% to 35'4 on more than 2.8 million shares. Traders attributed the activity to declining speculation about a possible takeover.
The gyrations in Pennzoil's stock left some investors mesmerized. Pennzoil, which soared 19% Tuesday on rumors that Texaco was planning to acquire the company through a stock swap, fell early yesterday on news that the company had rejected a plan to drop its $11.1 billion judgment against Texaco in exchange for a merger offer.
The stock rebounded and soared several points on fresh takeover rumors. When both Pennzoil and Texaco said they had ruled out hostile bids for one another, Pennzoil’s stock fell once again. At the close, the stock finished down 8% to 74% on more than 1.7 million shares. Texaco fell % to 30% on more than 1.5 million shares.
GAF fell 2% to 49'4 on 589,600 shares. The company said it plans to withdraw its $74-a-share offer for Union Carbide. Carbide dropped 1% to 71% on 937,100 shares.
Polaroid rose 1% to 44%. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a permanent injunction against Eastman Kodak, barring Kodak from selling instant cameras and films that impinge on Polaroid’s patents. Kodak fell 1% to 4874 on more than 1.3 million shares.
Koppers Co. moved up 1 to 23% after the stock was recommended by Oppenheimer & Co.
RCA Corp, rose % to 61% on more than 1.6 million shares The price increase came on persistent rumors that General Electric may boost its $66.50-a-share offer for RCA. GE, which fell 2% to 70%, has said its offer is fair and that it has signed a definitive agreement with RCA.
Beatrice, the most-active Big Board issue, tumbled 4 to 43'4 on more than 6.1 million shares. The company said Kohl-berg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. modified its acquisition proposal, which reduced the cash portion of its proposed purchase price for Beatrice and increases the amount that will be paid in preferred stock.
In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index fell 1.65 to 328.09 on volume of 139.9 million shares, up from 127.4 million shares Tuesday. There were 893 issues advancing and 1,119 declining.
The American Stock Exchange’s Market Value Index fell 2.63 to 247 26 on volume of 16.9 million shares, down from 23.8 million shares Tuesday.
