General Electric Co.'s options traded briskly. More than one trader bought February 50 put options against stock. The protective trade, a married put, hedges a bullish stock position by establishing a minimum selling price for the stock during the life of the put, and limits losses to the cost of the put. With GE shares down 75 cents to $47.31 at 4 p.m. Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the February 50 puts rose 88 cents to $4.75 on CBOE volume of 2,548 contracts, compared with open interest of 1,426. Another 2,511 contracts traded at other exchanges.

NEW YORK -- Options traders stayed on the defensive as stocks fell further back to earth Friday. As the euphoria from Wednesday's surprise interest-rate cut faded, investors again trained their focus onto the fundamentals -- corporate earnings, energy costs and interest rates -- and decided the picture still isn't pretty.
Traders wrote calls, pocketing the premium as a hedge against stock declines. With options volatility rising and put premiums expanding, fewer investors turned to protective put buying as a hedging strategy, according to an options strategist at a major Wall Street firm.
Early in the session, a rumor of problem loans to California utilities and derivative losses hit Bank of America Corp. Although the bank quickly squelched the rumor, Bank of America and other bank stocks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. lost ground on renewed concerns over credit quality. Options of these banks traded actively, with traders probably buying bearish puts and selling calls.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Market Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 option prices to determine investor sentiment, rose 2.07 to 32.03, above its recent range of between 20 and 30.
General Electric Co.'s options traded briskly. More than one trader bought February 50 put options against stock. The protective trade, a married put, hedges a bullish stock position by establishing a minimum selling price for the stock during the life of the put, and limits losses to the cost of the put. With GE shares down 75 cents to $47.31 at 4 p.m. Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the February 50 puts rose 88 cents to $4.75 on CBOE volume of 2,548 contracts, compared with open interest of 1,426. Another 2,511 contracts traded at other exchanges.
GE's call options were active, too. Investors who have written or sold January call options bought back those calls to close out short positions and sold calls that expire in further months.
In Terra Networks SA, at least one investor sold a large number of the out-of-the-money February 15 calls, probably as a hedge against an existing long stock position. The American depositary receipts of the Internet service provider were down 19 cents to $11.63 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday. The February 15 calls were at 69 cents on American Stock Exchange volume of 8,512 contracts, with 1,500 contracts trading at the CBOE. Composite open interest was 22.
