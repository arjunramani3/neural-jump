NEW YORK-The stock market's intest attempt to snap out of its .limitary slump collapsed anti turned Instead into Its sharpest decline since mid October.
Futures-related program selling repeatedly battered the market as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which finished last week with Its first back-to-back gains of the year, plunged 77.45 to 2600.45.
Traders attributed the 2.91? drop-the worst since the average plummeted 190.58 points Oct. 13—to n climate of nervousness that kept many investors away from the market and caused others to step aside as the selling programs arrived.
"There's nobody there to fill the vacuum on the buy side," said James C. Andrews. first vice president In charge of Institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott, Philadelphia.
Declining Issues routed advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by 1.336 to 267. Among broader market averages, the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index skidded 8.77 to 330.38, and the Big Board Composite Index dropped 4.36 to 183.20.
Sell programs resulting from stock-index arbitrage began hitting the market just after the first hour of trading and resurfaced periodically throughout the session, intensifying near the close.
But even with all the programs, Big Board volume slowed to 148,380,000 shares from 185,590.000 Friday. "Customers, by and large, are selling some stocks selectively and raising cash," said Edward J. Shopkorn, director of institutional equities at Mabon. Nugent & Co. "People are reluctant here to purchase stocks.”
The sell-off came despite a rebound in the Tokyo stock market, where the Nikkei index climbed more than 420 points to its first close above the 37000 level since Jan. 12. On the day that the index fell below that level, Tokyo's weakness spilled onto Wall Street as the Dow Jones industrials tumbled 71.46 points.
This time, however, traders set their sights on the Japanese bond market. Concern that the narrowing of the differential on bond yields between the U.S. and Japan could damp Japanese interest in U.S. Treasury securities caused stock-market players some concern, they said.
Meanwhile, disappointment that U.S. interest rates have failed to come down as expected to offset weakness in corporate earnings also continued to weigh on the market.	..
"Japanese interest-rate pressures have certainly cast a different light on the consensus of interest rates continuing to decline over the next several months," said A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research Corp.
Traders and analysts also cited bearish predictions from several top money managers interviewed by Barron's magazine as a factor in the market's plunge.
With the latest decline, the Dow Jones industrials have dropped a total of 299.70
iniluts, or 7.5'j. since rallying Jan. 2 to a record close of 2810.15.
"We're dealing with a break In upside momentum," salt) Joseph fl. Barthel, director of Investment strategy at Hopper Soliday & Co.. Philadelphia. He said he doesn't ex|>ect a quick reversal ot the latest rapid decline, and lie predicted there will be mure selling today.
"There's still some unfinished business on lhe downside." he said, adding that any weakness In markets elsewhere, particularly In Japan, will exacerbate declines In the U.S.
Mr. Moore said several market sectors sensitive to economic developments, such as chemicals, have experienced "breakdowns" as prices have fallen. In recent weeks, a number of analysts predicted that the economically sensitive issues would fare bettor than the overall market.
