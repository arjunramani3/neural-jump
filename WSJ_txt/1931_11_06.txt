Good advances were recorded on the Stock Exchange yesterday For a time prices flue- j tuated with wheat, and when that grain rallied , from its lowest there was a much better de-1 mand for stocks. However, the most impressive > showing was made after the close of the wheat j market. It was then that volume increased sub- , stantially over the earlier average and the best levels were established in the last half hour. • Shares which would be benefited by the strength I in silver and wheat were outstanding perform- i ers. Steel common was one of the leaders dur- [ ing the afternoon, and the action of this stock «»nrouraged active buying in others which disclosed that offerings were limited when the advances were in progress.

Higher prices for wheat have had some effect, and considerable attention has been attracted by the advance m oil prices, accompanied by predictions of further upturns later on. The action of the silver market has given encouragement to those who insist that the white metal is assuming a more prominent position in world affairs almost daily. Finally the upward, trend indicated in steel operations recently has been a favorable development.

Lnrillard Views Mixed
Various dividend views arc heard on Loril-lard.
