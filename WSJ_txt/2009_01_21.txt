Stocks had their best day in more than a month as the financial sector led a rebound from Tuesday's rout.
Double-digit-percentage gains for Citigroup, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 279.01 points, or 3.5%, to 8228.10. After a brief dip into negative territory in the morning, stocks strengthened as the session wore on, and the rally spread beyond financials into several other sectors.
The biggest gains since Dec. 16 recaptured most of the Dow's 332-point Inauguration Day drop. International Business Machines rose 12% after forecasting full-year earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations and a rise in fourth-quarter profit.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 35.02 points, or 4.4%, to 840.24, led by a 14% rebound in financials, which had hit a low in the previous session.
Banks got a late-day boost from a report that several Bank of America directors, including Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, bought more than 500,000 shares Tuesday, an apparent show of confidence in the lender. Shares in Bank of America, which fell 29% Tuesday, finished Wednesday up 31%.
Despite Wednesday's bank-led gains, the sector remains on a more than two-month-long decline. Traders continue to worry that many financial firms, especially Wall Street companies, will need further federal intervention, which could include issuance of new shares or dividend cuts, or both.
"All these options are not good for shareholders," said David James, senior vice president at James Investment Research in Alpha, Ohio.
Energy stocks were among the gainers, helped by a 6.6% rise in the price of oil amid a round of speculative buying as the March futures contract replaced February as the front-month contract.
As stocks rose, Treasury prices fell, sending yields higher. The dollar fell against the euro for the first time in three days.
