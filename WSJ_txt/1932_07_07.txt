The securities markets lost their vigor yesterday. While United States Government bonds were up on the day, European Government obligations were easier, German bonds selling off fairly sharply. South American issues held fairly well, with Argentine bonds strong, but the domestic list was disturbed by breaks in some of the speculative rail issues. Wheat closed fractionally lower and cotton lost around $1 a bale, but sugar moved up.
A number of factors contributed to bring on selling of stocks. A primary influence was the lack of certainty as to the actual terms of the apparent accord reached at Lausanne on the European inter-governmental financial problems. An accord, contingent on debt cancellation by the United States, as early reports indicated, would be disappointing, as it would only continue the present highly unsatisfactory European situation In the absence of full details as to what had transpired. Wall Street was inclined to be extremely skeptical.
The business news appearing during the day was discouraging. The report of the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to the Interstate Commerce Commission for May and the first five months hardly made pleasant reading. Although the report reflected only inter-state business. it gave a line on what the company, as a whole, has suffered in the way of curtailed business. Operating income in May was off 39% from May, 1931, while for the five months, operating income was down only 30.6r^ from the like five months of the previous year. Telephone clased down more than 3 points, reaching a new low at 7-1 i-s.
Chain Store Reports Foor
Another unsettling factor was the appearance during the day of several chain store company monthly statements, tho majority reporting wider percentage declines in Juno, from the 1931 month, than m the first half. Walgreen Co. sales, for instance, were down 20.4 in June, m contrast with a drop of only 13 7% in the first six months The reports belied statements made during June that retail business had shown some increase.
Breaks in individual issues, due to special circumstances, dampened enthusiasm for any upswing. International Shoe dropped another six points, following publication of the earnings statement, and International Business Machines went into new low ground, with a loss of over five points. International Shoe has been on a swift downgrade since it broke through 32, at which level it apparently was pegged tor a time. Business Machines has been a target tor sellers
Sideline*
Still 1'iwored
Developments at Lausanne continue to overshadow other news bearing on the course of the market. Without inspiring news from this quarter, the market cannot go far ahead, for the immediate business news and the imminence of the second quarter reports make a drab market stage-setting. Conservative interests continue to counsel a side-lines position for investors until the Lausanne news can be fully gauged.
Cut in Reparations Demand* IJnornious
The conferences at Lausanne have served tn bring out how far the European nations have gone in recognizing the impossibility of saddling one country with an enormous debt and having anything like real peace or stability in Europe. The present demands of France for a final pay-
ment are in striking contrast to the original demands made shortly after the close of the war.
At the peace conference after the World War, the Allies’ demands on Germany were figured at around $125,000,000,000. The original demand was abandoned even before the peace ‘treaty was written, and the progress in revising payments has gone through a number of tortuous steps since that time, each step leading to a scaling down. The steps have extended over a 12-year period, and each revision has followed a period of near chaos in European affairs.
In 1920, a total of $64,000,000,000 was proposed at a meeting of Allied representatives in France, but by 1921, the Reparation Commission estimated that the total due from Germany, under the Versailles Treaty, was only approximately $31,600,000,000. The Dawes Plan of 1924 set a scale of annuities to be paid, but the total of payments was left blank, and by June, 1929, when the Young Plan was drawn up, revising the entire basis of payments, the total of $8,800,000,000 was agreed to by both sides.
The matter of revising the reparations payments has been enormously complicated by the debts owed to the United States by the Allies, and the clause in the Versailles Treaty covering war guilt. Germany has consistently battled against the war guilt thesis, and the Allies have constantly had an eye on their war debts to the Uufted States in any discussion of revision of reparations.
France at Lausanne demanded a final payment from Germany of roughly 8950,000,000 to clean up reparations.
Northwest Carriers* Prospects Improved
Good crop prospects in the Northwest have stimulated some interest in shares of northwestern carriers, w’faich currently are selling not far above their year’s lows. Among those most favored are Northern Pacific and Great Northern. as both roads would benefit enormously from a heavy movement of crops.	,
At 7. the current selling price for the capital stock, the equity in Northern Pacific is valued in the market at $17,360,000. Even in 1931, the balance of earnings for the equity in the property was $8,902,336. so that the market currently is placing a value on the stock of less than twice net income available for the stock in ths most recent year.
So far this year, Northern Pacific has suffered a sharp decline in gross revenues. The big earnings period for the road, and for other Northwestern carriers, is ahead, however, and with the crop outlook good, the earnings of the road in the fall months should record a comeback. Northern Pacific is m strong financial shape, and earlier this year Charles Donnelly, president, asserted that it would no need to borrow any money this year.
Prospects for a big crop movement are even more favorable for the Great Northern, as last year the road suffered heavily as result of the drought in some of the most important wheat producing area it traverses.
The Great Northern has suffered this year as result of the heavy falling off in traffic, "particularly in ore traffic. There are no prospects of a pick-up in ore loadings, but a real improvement in crop movement would more than offset the slack orc shipments. Ore loadings of the Great Northern for the week ended June IS were 611 cars, against 4.209 in the like 1931 week.
