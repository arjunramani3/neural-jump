The securities markets turned downward yesterday, with the reaction in part attributable to a late break in wheat prices. Government bonds were steady most of the day, but the domestic list in general moved lower, ..The reaction in wheat, which came in the last hour, carried the July delivery to a new low, abd was stimulated by threshing reports from the Southwest which were more favorable than anticipated. Little suppprt was encountered on the break. Cotton also sold off.
A pacific note was sounded in the statements made by delegation heads at the Lausanne Conference, Premier Harriot's opening declaration gave room for hope that the French would go further in working toward a real solution of the reparations problem than at previous international conferences. However, observers in Lausanne indicated the fear that the conference, instead of reaching some clear-cut agreement, may degenerate into a fact-finding group, hunting for some formula for solution which will evade the real Issues. The prolongation of the present uncertainties surrounding the reparations and the intergovernmental debts questions can only serve to lessen the possibilities for any revival in world trade and deepen the depression abroad.
Temporary Traffic Spurt Cheers Rails Some
In the absence of any stimulating word from Lausanne, the Immediate business news was sufficient to discourage those looking for highei stock prices. A series of railroad reports, all reflecting only too clearly the depressed conditions of the railroad industry, put a damper on efforts to move the rail stocks higher. An clement of hopefulness was Injected Into the rail outlook, however, by confirmation of reports that during the past week or two some carriers have enjoyed a pickup in traffic, attributed to heavier shipments of certain commodities to accumulate stocks before the new taxes go into effect. While this is only a temporary traffic stimulus, it is at least heartening.
Cigarette production figures confirmed recent pessimistic reports, the May figures recording a decline of more than 10% below the corresponding 1031 month. American Tobacco B dipped off more than three points from the preceding close, the stock dropping sharply in the late trading, after publication of the figures. Testimony as to the effect of the low rate of steel output on iron orc consumption was afforded by the figures for May, which showed consumption off about 60%. from the like 1931 month. Stocks of ore on hand at furnaces and Lake Erie docks on June 1 were about 20:4 ahead of June 1. 1931. hardly a favorable factor in the outlook for the big orc-carrying roads.
Tleas for Railroad Bond Buying Iajuhm Accumulate
Agitation for loans to railroads to permit them to purchase their own bonds in the open market nt present depreciated prices is increasing. Colonel Leonard Ayres, of the Cleveland Trust Co., is one of the latest converts. He declares in a recent bulletin that probably no more helpful use could be made of a portion of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.'s funds than in this manner.
So far. several objections hRve been offered to the entry of private capital into this field. In at least one instance, a comprehensive plan
of action to purchase bonds of one carrier in the open market was prepared. It was estimated that with a loan of $8,000,000, approximately $20,000,000 of the road's first mortgage bonds could be bought in, even assuming a 20-polnt rise in the bonds.	-
The principal objections to the employment of private capital have centered about the uncertainties surrounding the present railroad sit-! uation. Carrier directors have pointed out that.' any bonds purchased in the open market would be held by the institution making the loan as collateral for the loan. So long as the railroad's earning power was sufficient to meet interest charges on the bonds, interest on the loan , would be secure, and repayment of part of the loan would be assured . However, if receivership were forced on the road, there wopld be outstanding an additional amount of debt for which provision would have to be made in any reorganization plan. While the debt would be secured by the bonds already purchased, neither railroad directors or bankers are keen to enter into any proposal which includes the possibility of any such eventuality.
Attitude of Caution Continues to Rule
Yesterday's decline carried pivotal stocks below levels at which the possibility of support had been envisaged. The action of the market itself on Thursday clearly indicated that increasing resistance was being encountered to the advance, and yesterday's downswing gave fairly conclusive evidence that temporarily, at, least, the impetus for a further recovery was absent. Defeat of the bonus bill and adjourn-; ment of Congress, or really good news from Lausanne might provide stimulus for another rally, but conservative opinion continues to , suggest a cautious attitude toward the market. | California Utility Rato Caso Is Vital
The prolongation of the Industrial depression has brought to the fore public agitation for rate decreases both by utility companies and by railroads. Among the important utility rate cases attracting interest are those of the San; Joaquin Light & Power and the Midland Coun-the Electric Service, in which the companies are involved with the California Railroad Commission. Both companies are seeking a rehearing of the commission's order providing for a reduction in rates.
*In the application for the rehearing, counsel for the San Joaquin declare, in discussing the section of the order directing discontinuance of certain bills for agricultural power service, that the order was made not because existing rates were unjust or unreasonable, but because of the depressed condition of agriculture in the territory'and on the assumption that the commission has the right to require the company to maintain rate for agricultural power service that are less than reasonable and below the value of the service.
Such an issue is new to recent rate cases in California, and for this reason, the cases are of-particular significance. An idea of the depth of the cuts ordered may be gleaned from the company's estimate that they would reduce San Joaquin's gross revenues this year to roughly 20r; below the 1931 level, according to the company's figures.
Not only are the rate cases vital to San Joaquin, but they also assume importance for the whole Pacific Coast area.
