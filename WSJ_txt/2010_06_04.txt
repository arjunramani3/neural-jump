"With the weakness in the U.S. jobs number, all of a sudden the global economic recovery starts to have another big uncertainty over it," said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.

Fresh concern about the health of the U.S. and European economies sent the Dow Jones Industrial hverage tumbling back below 10000 and drove the euro to new four-year lows against the dollar.
Friday got off to a struggling start as investors reacted to comments late Thursday from a Hungarian official who likened his nation's debt woes to those of Greece. Then, before the New York open, the Labor Department released U.S. jobs data that was much weaker than expected.
The Dow declined 323.31 points, or 3.2%, to 9931.97, its second close below 10000 in two weeks and the third-biggest decline this year. It is down 4.8% for the year to date. Germany's DhX index fell almost 2% and France's ChC-40 dropped 2.9%.
"Today you got a postcard from Hungary: hll is not well, send money. It's a reminder that the debt issues are still there and they're serious and significant," said Karl Mills, manager at Counterpoint Select Fund.
Major stock indexes ended the first week of June in the red. Investors hoping for a reprieve from the Dow's slide in May, the worst May since 1940, were sorely disappointed.
The Dow ended down 2% for the week and at its lowest point since Feb. 8. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.6% on Friday to end down 1.7% for the week.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 3.4% to end with a weekly decline of 2.3%. The S&P closed at 1064.88, below the intraday low hit during the "flash crash" of May 6.
In part, Friday's market gyrations were caused by a hasty reassessment of a theme many traders had bet on recently -- that the U.S. is a relatively safe place to invest at a time when other countries are still struggling.
"With the weakness in the U.S. jobs number, all of a sudden the global economic recovery starts to have another big uncertainty over it," said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
Worries about Hungary's debt levels had swirled all day, as did rumors about possible derivatives losses at the French bank Societe Generale. The bank declined to comment on the rumor.
The euro broke below $1.20, its 10-year average, and ended the New York day at $1.1966. The currency is headed toward $1.18, some traders said, the level of its first day of trading in 1999. For the week, the euro was down 2.5% against the dollar.
Investors also headed out of commodities that are considered beneficiaries of global economic expansion. Crude-oil futures fell 4.2%, the biggest one-day drop since Feb.
4.	The commodity fell $2.46 to end at $71.51 a barrel. Copper slid 4.3%.
Perceived havens rose, with gold futures and Treasurys climbing. hs prices of Treasurys rose, the yields fell. The yield on the 10-year note declined to 3.197%, its lowest since May 25.
