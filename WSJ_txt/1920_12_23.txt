THE STOCK MARKET
RAPID RECOVERY
Short covering added to some new buying results in a general upturn in prices— Mexican Petroleum, rubber stocks and the independent steels leads tlie way—Sterling exchange holds recent rally—Some oi those who established losses on Wednesday have trouble getting their stocks hack.
Sales. l.lfdl.SOO shares.
The improvement that become noticeable near the close on Wednesday became decidedly pronounced during yesterday’s session. Stocks opened higher and before the dny wns over the short interest had become decidedly worried. The rally in some of the specialties was sharp. The leaders in the'upturn were Sears, Roebuck with a recovery of tl ponits from the week’s low; Baldwin, 7; Mexican Petroleum. 11; U. S. Steel common, .1; Atlantic. Gulf & West Indies, 9; Crucible, 8; and the tobaccos, nn average of three points.
The sentiment around the Street showed distinct improvement. Some houses arc predicting that the lows of tlie Inst week will be duplicated perhaps again in February, but even these houses think that we arc in for an upturn that should run well into January. The public has been cleaned out of stocks, hut they have passed into 'strong hands. If the hanking interes-ts that have taken stocks for supporting purposes want to sell them they can only do so by putting up prices. The public will buy on the way up, but not on the way down.
A Firm Opening
The market showed a decidedly firm tone at the opening. L. S. Steel common was up nt 77%, which compare with a low this week of 76%. Bethlehem Steel B. which sold a few day ago under 49, opened nt 50"s. an overnight gain of Reading was up a full point at 77 *•*.
Mexican Petroleum, which pot ns low ns 150*4 nn Wednesday. opened nt 155** and then sold at 156. Vanadium was up at 30%. Amons the tire stocks, Kelly-Springfield. which sold down to 25’4 on Tuesday, opened at 30*4. an overnight gain of a point.
I’. S. Rubber Makes New Low While Steels Lead Upturn
The market showed an improved tone around 11 o’clock and the steel stocks led in the upturn. Big blocks of U. S. Steel common were taken at 78. an advance of nearly 2 points over the week’s low. Crucible ran up to 80. n recovery of about 5 points. About, the only exception was IL S. Rubber common which broke to a new low for the year at 53.
Rcplogle Holdings of Vanadium Undisturbed -
A representative of a bunk interested *in Vanadium says liquidation of the stock has been completed. Any stock sold by firms that failed has been disposed of under the rules of the iStock Exchange. It is pointed out that
Vanadium is not a steel company. It has a practical monopoly of the important alloys that enter into steel manufacture. Its prices cannot be unduly depressed by competition. None of the holdings of the Replogle family has been disturbed. Vanadium is selling about 10 points below its underwriting price and almost 70 points from the high established this year. The stock sells ex-dividend of SI a share on December 31.
Rubber Stocks Unduly Depressed
Tho advance continued into the second hour and the revering of short contracts became general. The selling has been sadly overdone in many directions. An example hns boon Goodrich which sold down under 27 this week and U. S. Rubber which touched 53 yesterday. Kelly-Springfield got as low ns 25*4 earlier in tho week. These three companies are among the loaders in the tire industry and must enjoy big business as long as the demand for all forms of rubber goods continues. Goodrich sells a diversified product in which it is in much the same position as U. S. Rubber. U. S. Rubber pays 8% annually in dividends and interests In control of the company here expect the rate to be continued at the January mooting. Goodrich pnys 6% and has already declared its dividend payable in February next. There are many who believe that Goodrich is also well able to continue the present dividend. The yield At 27 is approximately 22% on the investment. Kelly-Springfield pays 4% annually in cash as well as 12% in stock. There is no plan among the directors of this company tn change the dividend disbursement. Kelly-Springfield manufactures the highest-priced automobile tires turned nut in this country and has recently been making big strides in the truck tire field. Kelly-Springfield’s new plant in Cumberland, Nd., will probably treble the company’s capacity, but without including this new plant it is understood that earnings in 1920 were over twice the common dividend after all charges including Federal taxes.
Sinclair
Large blocks of Sinclair wore sold Wednesday to establish losses, hut the stock was well taken, closing with a decline of % of a point. The stock sells ex-stock dividend on the 31st of the current month, and a large amount of the stock sold for tax purposes will be bought in before that date. It is well known that several important interests have been hiL hard by the decline in Sinclair. On tho other hand other large interests of the company have been heavy buyers of the stock. It is also known that one large financier has substituted a large line of bonds and high grade stocks for Sinclair, believing that there will be a substantial improvement in the stock next year.
Kelly-Springfield Leads Recovery in Rubbers
On the Dow. Jones analysis of the rublier situation published earlier in the day there was a sharp rally in all the rubber stocks. Compared with the lows of the week, these recoveries up to 12:39 amounted to nearly 7 points in Kelly-Springfield, 4 points in Goodrich and over 2 points in U. S. Rubber.
Good Buying of Old Line Investment Issues
Among the oils. Royal Dutch ran up to 60, against a low during the last week under 50. The improvement in sterling exchange, which got above $3.53, helped this stoek. Sears, Roebuck was the feature of the specialties, advancing to an early high at 96, against a low cn Tuesday of 85’4. Floor brokers report good buying orders in a number of old line investment stocks which touched rather low levels in the recent break. An instance is Consolidated Gas which sold down to within tailing distance of 70 on Tuesday which is almost a 10% yield on the $7 dividend. Another stock in which gool support was seen was Union Pacific which, around 112 returned a yield of practically 9% on the $10 annua dividend payment.
U. S. Steel Current Quarter Earnings Good
U. S. Steel common got above 78 around nud-day and Bethlehem Steel B above 82. Republic acted well around 58. The United States Steel Corporation is operating from 85 to 90*5 of its capacity, a remarkabh showing when the fact is taken into consideration that the steel industry has been in a state of depression foi the last several months. What is more, certain interests of U. S. Steel say that operations will be well maintained throughout 1921. If this is true, good earnings for tie current quarter can be looked for when the statement is issued next month. Satisfactory earnings for 1921 at? also a.--sured if the predictions of Steel interests pro’e correct. Anyway, the common dividend seems safe foi tho next twelve months nt least. By tfiat time tho ste<l industry may bo flourishing. A house that usually operates for U. S. Steel people was a large buyer of Steel commv: Wednesday.
Passing of Copper Dividends Has Little Effect
The passing of the dividend on Inspiration and Greene Cnnanca had little effect on the general list. Inspiration reacted about a point, but the loss in Greene Canatva was only y. In other words, the action of the directors had been pretty well expected.
Standard Oil of N. J. Advance*
The new $25 pur value common stock of the Standard Oil Co. of N. J. was traded in for the first time yesterday, selling at 144 and 145. Latter price was ecjual to 580 for the old $100 par stoek. up 10 points from Thursday’s close. From its previous high of 910, just prior to being listed, the stock is ofT 330 points. The relatively low price at present operates to the advantage ot employes under the recently adopted stock participation plan, which becomes operative on January 1. next. Subscription price to employes is to be not more than 10% above or below the average price in tho previous three months with the company providing 50% of the amount subscribed by employee
• Big Losses Established Wednesday
There was heavy selling of stocks Wednesday to establish losses. Judging from the action of yesterday’.- market these stocks may be repurchased at much higher prices. As an example, an investor sold 5,000 shares of the stock of a certain company with instructions to repurchase several points lower. The stock advanced after the sa and was five points higher yesterday. A large amount Sinclair wns sold around 2014 Wednesday to establish i«»-ses. The stock was a point higher yesterday. The sellers n« ver got a chance to buy back below the sale price. A amount of Bethlehem Steel B was also sold aroun-i to establish losses, with instructions to buy back at V? The stock was nearly 4 points from Wednesday’s h»"
