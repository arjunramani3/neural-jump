•	1.15 p. m.—The railroad list seemed to be beginning to cut itself free from the other interests, and to act independently of traction stocks and industrials. The dealing in C., B. & Q. and grangers generallv was considerable. Burlington were bought bv Boston brokers. A revival of speculations on the Baltimore ft Ohio dividend and a hopeful view taken gave strength to the stock. Some 12,000 shares were dealt in between 59 and 60. Louisville were active. Foreign brokers were the most conspicuous buyers. In the traction stocks some 15,000 shares were dealt in between 67 and 68. and the stock looked like holding.

2.15.—Operators were beginning to canvass the -effect of the advance in rates on the railroad earnings and some buying of the Trunk line stocks on this basis came from commission houses. Strength in B. & O. was in part attributed to saoguinc rumors of a dividend on the common as well as. a lump dividend on the preferred. The strength of the Norfolk ft Western independent position in view of the Trunk line developments caused some dealings in that stock and accounted for its strength.
