Among the weakest fea-
that class were Bethlehem Steel, Westinghouse
than might have been as some of the papers alarm at Washington, view of the matter 1 of the press.
Westinghouse was weak, declining to 100% after having opened unchanged at 103%. Pressed Steel Car lost % by opening at 56, but Amer’can Car & Foundry gained % on the first sale, which was at 57%. Can lost a point on the first sale, and soon added % to its decline by dropping to 41%.
Steel was firm, the initial loss from Saturday’s strong close being only 14, making the opening sale at 59%. Union Pacific opened % off. and Reading’s initial loss was Canadian Pacific opened 1% down at 164, when New York Central was unchanged at 88%. There was considerable selling of the general list by the commission
Break in Si>eciaHies	*
After a break of good sized proportions in the specialties, like Westinghouse. Pressed Steel
some of ___	________* ___ ___________ .	Car and National I^ead, but of comparatively small extent in the standard issues, the market developed a rallying tendency and at 10:30 the trading was active with prices up appreciably from the low. Although the traders predicted war with Germany, large interests did not seem to be concerned over the situation, although probably some of them welcomed the check to speculative activity in specialties.
Wcstinghou-sc sold down to 98%, but soon scored a recovery of about 4 points from the low. Considering the extent of tho advance in that issue in the past few weeks, the reaction of 9 points from the high was hardly more than might, have been expected. There scorned to be a good demand for the stock at the low level.
Pressed St^ol Car declined 3% to 53%. Reports regarding the order for equipment received from the Russian government varied widely, and the Street was inclined to think the amount is amut 819,000,000, with no very wide margin of profit.	*
U. S. Steel maintained a good tone, and New York Central showed positive strength, gaining % by selling up to 89. while prices elsewhere were under Saturday’s closing figures.
Rise in Steel
The development of pronounced strength in United States Steel helped the whole market, and at eleven o’clock the tone wns good at substantia! recoveries from the low. Some of the traders who had sold at the opening seemed to be trying to get tieir stocks back.
After the clo-e on Saturday, bids of 60% were said to have heen made for United States Steel, and the stock before the end of the first hour net only reached that level but got ’♦ above it. 3.000 shares being done in a block at 60%. That was an advance of a full point from Saturday’s last transaction on the Exchange. Reports that the company has received a very large war order were persistently reiterated, and were regarded as reasonable in view of the fact that, with the possible exception of Bethlehem Steel, no company in the United States is as well enuipped as United States Steel for the handling of that kind of business.
Anaconda was relatively much stronger than Amalgamated. holding firmly when the latter declined 2% to 73%. and afterwards gaining % by selling to 36%. The practical equalization of the two stocks strengthened th® belief in an early dissolution of Amalgamated Copper, and retirement of its stock by exchange of two shares of Anaconda for one. Chino sold off sharply, losing 2% by selling at 44%. while Utah was sufficiently firm to indicate belief in the probability of an increase of the dividend.
Rear Pressure
The bears renewed their attack on the market in the second hour, and succeeded m getting prices off again, although they failed to shake out much stock. There was no orgamzed support, but stocks were wanted on declines, and in the standard issues the undertone seemed to oe verv good. That t-e attack was renewed did not surprise any one, for such things as the possibility of war with Germany do not occur often, and when they happen the most must be made of them.
As part of the bear attack upon the market, cfxorts were made to belittle the importance of war orders; but while it was asserted that Steel had not entered into contracts to do business direct with the Allies, the buying of tho stock was of such a confident kind as to indicate that theie had been some important favorable development in the recent past.

A Sharp Decline
In tho complete absence of aggressive bears renewed their attack on the market afternoon, and succeeded in criving prices lower than those reached on the earlier reactions, fact that prices fell to levels under those nt which stocks had previously shown good resistance tended to promote a bearish feeling, and the chart readers predicted that the decline would go further.
It is an open question how much longer the market could have held up without reaction even if no such incident as the German submarine attack on an American ship had occurred- A reaction was due. and apparently the market had only been waiting for a pretext. Sooner or later it would probably have reacted with or without one.
In manv places it was predicted that the next time an upward movement occurred, war orders would not be much_ of a factor in producing it.
On rumors that the orders for war munitions had been exaggerated, Westinghouse sold off 6% points tc 97% and Bethlehem Steel declined 8% to 132%.
"on the decline a large part of the selling was for short account, but there was also some liquidation, and it may take the market some time to digest the sales.
A Rallying Tendency
tendency to rally developed in the late afternoon, but the traders* said the* buying was chiefly for coveung or shorte? and that stocks should be sold on strong spots. It was argued that until the matter of the sinking of an American ship was cleared up, U would not be safe to follow advances very far.
Rock Island v.as a notably strong feature, making a good response to the statement for March, which compared favorablv with the returns for several years pust, although both in gro.>s and net the figures were a little under those of 1914. New Haven tecovered well and was helped by the March figures which bore out the statements niude some time ago in The WalV Street Journul thut the corner had been turned. The net for the month amounted to $264,806 compared with deficits of approximately that amount in 1914 and 1913.
