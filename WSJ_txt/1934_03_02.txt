unchanged at	for two months, 1% for
three months. 1 l-16rc for four and set months
British Gold Movements
LONDON—London Gazette reports that during the three days to mid-day of March I. imports of gold into the United Kingdom amounted to £7.348.046, of which £4,484,845 came from France, £1.294.295 from Germany, and £1,177,918 from South Africa. Exports during that period amounted to £7,343,253, of which £7,2S0»-060 went to America.
LONDON—Gold bars were quoted in thr open market at 136s lO^d.
LONDON—The £4S5.000 bar gold available in the open market was taken for unknown destinations.
Puffer Tin Pool Opposed
LONDON—The Singapore Chamber of Commerce has unanimously passed a resolution opposing formation of a buffer tin pool. This action follows a similar resolution recently adopted by the Malayan Chamber of Mines.
French Steel Output Up
PARIS—French steel ingot output in January was 517.000 tons, against 492.000 m December and 504,000 in January, 1933. Pig iron output for January was 526 000 tons, against 523 000 and 4SS.OOO, respectively. The number of furnaces in blast remained unchanged during the month at 90, against SI at the end of January, 1933.
Paris Bourse
PARIS—Prices on the Bourse were heavy.
Paris Banks’ Interest Rate Up
PARIS—The Pans money market is tight. The Bourse carry-over rate was 2^r'f and the official rate 5' <. Pans banks have announced an increase to %.rr for interest paid on deposits.
Foreign exchanges are quiet. Gold exports to America have ceased and are difficult to London. After declining steadily, however, the premiums on forward dollars and sterling are tending to stiffen again. Italian lira rallied sharply against the franc under the influence of vigorous support.
Bei'lin Boerse Reacts at End of Week
BERLIN—The Boerse was firm during the first half of the week, but later pnees reacted and dealers continuously sold stocks. Metallurgical, however, were strong, gaining 5 to 6 points, and rayons again rose 2 to 3 points.
Bonds were rather weak, although government issues were defended by steady purchases by the Reichsbank. It is believed the market has not yet digested the large issues originating from conversion of dollar bonds.
The Postal Administration announces conversion of rm. 150.000,000 of 6% bonds, due on April 1. into 4!a% bonds of 1939 at a price of 97. Similar Prussian conversion already has proved successful.
These issues constitute a further step in the general policy of lowering interest rates. Nevertheless, the date of wholesale conversion of long term bonds is still uncertain and probably will not come in the near future.
