Utility Action the Real Feature
The real feature of yesterday’s market was the performance of the utility stocks m the last half hour of trading-. Utilities have lagged behind the market, suffering from neglect as traders and investors rushed to buy industrials, which will benefit speedily from any advance in commodity prices. They were taken in hand in the late dealings, and whirled forward in heavy trading.
The leaders on the upward move were Consolidated Gas, North American, and Public Service of New Jersey. In the late trading North American went from around 19 to as high as 24 H.,; Consolidated Gas soared above 50, and Public Service jumped forward to over 40.
On the basis of the business outlook, prospects for utilities are fairly cheering, but constant agitation for rate reductions, or shifts in the methods of levying taxes so that the burden wilL fall on the power companies and not consumers, has beclouded the picture. The lower House of Congrecss yesterday amended the gasoline tax bill so as to provide that the 3% tax on electrical energy should be levied on the producer, and not on the domestic user as at preseent. If the Senate concurs in the amendment, utility companies will suffer.
Ward's Inventory Gamble
The management of Montgomery Ward took a gamble lust year and built tip inventories. Most other department store, chain store and mail order house managements cut their inventories, partly to enable them to hold their cash positions. Montgomery Ward’s strong financial position enabled it to make what was something of a speculative move, which bids fair to turn out to be of considerable profit to the company.
At the end of January, 1933, Montgomery Ward’s inventories stood at §40.749,557 compared with $36,305,748, at the end of January. 1932, up around 12'7'.-,. In the calendar year 1932, Ward’s sales volume ran to roughly S1S0,-000,000, and Ward’s inventoriese at the end of January were far higher in relation to sales volume than were those of Sears-Roebuck. Sears, in the calendar year, did a gross business of around $280,000,000. and inventories at the end of its year were $49,000,000, a substantial reduction from the previous year-end.
Ward’s inventory position adds a good deal of speculative flavor to the company’s shares. With rising wholesale and retail prices. Ward will benefit very largely. Companies which cut their inventories heavily last year will be sufferers if the advances in wholesale prices arc extremely swift and assume large proportions.
One item in the Montgomery Ward picture which should not be overlooked is the option on 100,000 shares held by Scwail Avery, president, which was granted him when he joined the company. The option was given at 811 a share, and at current prices for Montgomery Ward, Mr. Avery’s potential profit is approaching the 81,000.000 mark, if he has not as yet taken advantage of the option.
The Railroad Outlook
Carrier shares joined in the advance yesterday, and moved ahead, but there was persistent selling in them as they worked higher, and there were no very abrupt advances, such as occurred in some of the industrials. There is a good deal of confusion as to just what the effects of inflation will be on the carriers, but that gradually should be eliminated.
In the first place, generally advancing prices in this country should still the outcry for railroad rate reductions. That is beneficial. In addition, if the President’s public works program is put through, the railroads should benefit with other companies in it. After all, they will get increased traffic, and that is what is needed to revive the railroads.
On the other side of the picture is the question of wages and salaries. A general rise in prices will mean stiff pressure on carrier managements to increase both wages and salaries, which will offset, to some extent, the benefits of increased traffic. At present, it seems likely that the first test of wage matters will come in July, when, under provisions of the Chicago agreement, extending the 10% wage deduction, either organized railroad employes or managements con take steps to bring about a readjustment.
Up to the Rails
At yesterday’s close, the Dow-Jones industrial average stood at 72.27, a clear-cut break through the trading range high of 68.05. The average of 20 rail stocks, although it moved up to 28.75 at the finish, is still almost two points under the trading area top of 30.61.
Under the Dow theory, an upward move by one average through a resistance point is not conclusive evidence of a trend unless confirmed by the action of the other. So the movement of the railroad stocks is given added importance, since the industrials already have pushed through the trading area high.
