chief inspiration for the better feeling in financial quarters. Some trade authorities think motor production will not reach its peak before March or April. If purchasing power ot the public continues to improve, a condition that would be suggested by a rising stock market and a more diversified upturn in industry, the motor trade by that time should be able to sustain operations satisfactorily for it would be entering the season of open weather when every inducement to motor demand would be at hand.
Bulls were quick to pass on the gold clause decisions ket, a wave ot bin mg startin; the a nnounccmcnt that i’._ Railroad had won its case. detailed information appeared rickcis tne pace mentum rapidlv chine: \ w a transactions, falling 12 minutes behind. TTjin was the first time since July 22 that the tape fell so far behind Volume of dealings which up to noon was of negligible proportions swelled to a total of 1,910,000 shares for the dav, the highest since July 27, 1934.	*
Rail shares performed most sensationally in the initial upturn Atchison swept ahead to 52 fox- a gain of more than lu points from , the morning low before* encountering lornndablc 1 resistance Union Pacific was up nearly* 7 points i and some of the lower priced rails, selling undei tne twenties, were 2 to nearly 4 points higher at the peak of the move.
The speed and extent of the rise created a vacuum immediately under the day's best levels and rails lost 50 G of tlieir gain** almost as quickly. There was a period of Hesitancy and reduced volume while the market settleddown to niuit* x.orxnai fluctuation.*- anil the industrials then assumed a greatex* part in th? advance.
I Most of the standard industrial stocks had participated in the initial upturn with results almost as dramatic as the rails, but a naw h.ivmg wave started in industrials in the last hour which carried the market ahcau to a broad and active close

RAIL TRAFFIC—
Rail traffic will have to keep moving forward at a good pace through the next month If it is to maintain a favorable comparison with the trend of a year ago between mid-February and mid-March. At this time In 1934 some extreme winter weather set In and the coal movement wan exceptionally heavy through the first half of March.
Coal shipments were good in the early part of last week, rising above the high levels of the early part of the preceding week. There is a good chance that so far as the coal influence is concerned, loadings for the latest week will rise above the total of the preceding week and maintain their gains over the corresponding period of a year ago for at least one week more.
DIESEL AND AIR CONDITIONING_______
The two industries that have captured imagination of the financial district in much same manner as the radio and automotive ... dustry of a decade ago are the air conditioning and Diasel engine fields. Over the week-end considerable analysis and comment was made on both topics, in the press and in broker’s circulars. Some houses are looking into the Diesel engine situation more thoroughly with the idea of sifting and finding the companies which hold forth the greatest promise for profit.

MILL EQUIPMENT ORDERS—
The demand for steel null equipment, for both domestic and foreign consumption, is broadening at a rate ■which makes it difficult to keep abreast of developments. Besides the ’ Bethlehem Steel inquiry for its Lackawanna , strip mill, for which bids have been submitted, the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp, inquirv for a blooming mil], part of a S4.000.000 expansion project is in a more promising stage.
Russian. Japanese and Mexican inquiries are overhanging the market, all in a live stage. American corporations also are working on zinc mill equipment orders for foreign companies.
