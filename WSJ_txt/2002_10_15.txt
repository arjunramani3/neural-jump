The gains in the Dow industrials were echoed by other U.S. indexes. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 61.91, or 5.07% to 1282.44, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 39.83, or 4.73% to 881.27.
Over the four-day period, the overall value of U.S. stocks has surged $1.1 trillion to $9.95 trillion, based on the value of stocks in the Wilshire 5000 Index, which includes almost every company based in the U.S.
Stocks are due to continue outshining bonds, said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, Wells Fargo & Co.'s money-management arm. Since late 1999, the performance of the S&P 500 has trailed that of Treasury bonds by an astounding 90%, Mr. Paulsen notes. That hasn't happened since the crash of 1929, which leads Mr. Paulsen to conclude that stocks are overdue for a rebound. Until earlier this year, Mr. Paulsen was leaning away from stocks and toward bonds, but in recent months he has shifted to the view that stocks will recover.

Just a week after plunging to five-year lows, stocks rose in a buying frenzy that has pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by more than 13% over four days and sparked a debate on Wall Street over whether the rally is for real.
On the surface, the markets looked brighter than they have since summer. The Dow industrials yesterday surged 378.28 points, or 4.80%, to 8255.68. Volume was heavy, with 1.87 billion shares changing hands. Though the blue-chip index still is down 18% this year, and remains 30% off its record, it has rebounded a startling 13.3% since Thursday. That is the biggest four-day percentage gain since 1933, when stocks were recovering after the stock-market crash.
Optimists pointed out that some fundamental reasons were behind the gains: Companies such as General Motors Corp. and Citigroup Inc. announced better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, and the fourth quarter historically has often been a period of recovery for stock prices.
But skeptics noted that the beaten-down industrial average was overdue for a bounce. The index staged a similar recovery in July, when the industrials rose more than 400 points on each of two days -- and a total of 1,351 points, or 17.5%, over a one-month period -- only to give back all its gains and fall to a new low.
Big one-day stock surges, even when they come in rapid succession, have generally been a sign in the past of tough days to come, not of a long-term rally. Of the 20 biggest one-day percentage gains in the Nasdaq composite, 18 have come during this bear market, and all have been followed by more and bigger declines. Of the DJIA's 20 biggest one-day percentage gains, almost all came in 1930s, a troubled time for stocks.
"I take 13% pretty seriously, obviously, and I am grateful for it," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at mutual-fund group Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kansas. "But I wish I could put my finger on a change that would make me more than cautiously optimistic, and I can't find it."
The gains in the Dow industrials were echoed by other U.S. indexes. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 61.91, or 5.07% to 1282.44, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 39.83, or 4.73% to 881.27.
Over the four-day period, the overall value of U.S. stocks has surged $1.1 trillion to $9.95 trillion, based on the value of stocks in the Wilshire 5000 Index, which includes almost every company based in the U.S.
Overseas markets also soared. Major indexes in both Germany and France, which have been even more volatile than U.S. stocks, rose nearly 7% each.
Short-term investors shoveled money into stocks and away from the Treasury bonds to which they had been fleeing earlier this month. That dealt a sharp blow to Treasury prices, which had risen so high that some analysts were describing the government bond market as a "bubble." The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell almost two points, or $19.69 per $1,000 invested. That is something it hadn't done in almost a year. The yield, which rises when the price falls, jumped to 4.04%, the first time it has been above 4% in a month.
In the meantime, investors did get some disappointing earnings news after the close of regular trading hours. Intel Corp. announced third-quarter profit and sales that were short of what was anticipated, and it guided investors toward the low end of expectations for the current quarter. After rising 9% during the regular trading day, Intel shares fell 12.9%, or $2.13 to $14.39 in after-hours trading.
Despite the four-day gains, stocks still are well down over the past year. The Dow industrials have made it back to the low they hit in the wake of last year's terrorist attacks, but the other major indexes, as well as the Wilshire, all remain below that post-attacks level.
The S&P 500 is down 23% since the year began, and is 42% off its record, while the Nasdaq composite is down 34% this year, 75% off its record.
Many investors are hoping that stocks will be able to sustain their gains for several months. They believe that the recent selling was overdone and that corporate profits will
continue to recover now. Whether this marks an ultimate bottom for the market depends on whether companies manage to report stronger earnings in future quarters, they
say. In the shorter term, though, this rally might continue at least for weeks.

"We note that observers are generally unconvinced of an important upturn," wrote Phil Roth, chief technical market analyst at New York brokerage firm Miller Tabak, in a note to clients. "While we, too, are unconvinced, we see the glass as half full, not half empty."
Stocks are due to continue outshining bonds, said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, Wells Fargo & Co.'s money-management arm. Since late 1999, the performance of the S&P 500 has trailed that of Treasury bonds by an astounding 90%, Mr. Paulsen notes. That hasn't happened since the crash of 1929, which leads Mr. Paulsen to conclude that stocks are overdue for a rebound. Until earlier this year, Mr. Paulsen was leaning away from stocks and toward bonds, but in recent months he has shifted to the view that stocks will recover.
Another problem is that much of the recent rally has been due to the arcane activities of short sellers, investors who bet on stock declines by borrowing stock from brokerage firms and selling it. After sharp stock declines, short sellers take their profits by buying the stock back, which can cause sudden, sharp rallies.
And while several blue-chip companies have announced profits that exceeded expectations, those expectations had been slashed sharply in recent weeks, meaning that the results are well below what was expected just a few weeks ago.
Many analysts worry that stocks still aren't cheap compared with their current earnings power.
"On average, at major market lows, stocks sold below book value, at 14 times dividends and at eight times earnings," based on the behavior of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since the 1930s, noted analyst Ned Davis of Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla., in a report to clients. "The current readings of 3.5 times book, 52 times dividends and 27 times earnings (and the quality of some of the earnings is in question) do not look cheap even if we acknowledge that inflation and interest rates are low."
