Stocks rebounded to finish the week with a rally, shrugging aside the worst employment data in more than 30 years as worries about the economy sparked a further decline in oil prices.
Light, sweet crude for January delivery fell 6.6%, or $2.86, to $40.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 25% over the past six trading days to the lowest price since December 2004, as worries continued that energy demand will fall amid a global recession.
But when the price didn't fall below the psychological level of $40, it contributed to a late-day rise in stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which slid 215 points Thursday in anticipation of the jobs report and about 260 points Friday morning after the jobs report was released, finished up 259.18 points, or 3.1%, to 8635.42.
"At this point, people think the bad news is baked into the market," said Nick Kaupp, a stock trader with Source Trading, in Stamford, Conn. "In the past, customers have pulled their bids on numbers like those. But today they didn't. Our buyers stayed buyers."
Investors also welcomed the afternoon news that the Federal Reserve had purchased $5 billion of debt from government-chartered mortgage lenders and banks. The financial sector got a boost from an improved profit outlook from Hartford Financial Services Group, which saw its shares more than double in price.
Still, the Dow was down 2.2% for the week, for the fourth weekly decline in five weeks.
The Labor Department reported the biggest decline in nonfarm payrolls since December 1974 and the highest unemployment rate in 15 years. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the percentage of mortgage holders who are behind in their payments hit a record.
The mood in the oil market remained gloomy as traders were fixated on worsening economic conditions.
"This is just a 'get me out' sort of day," said Darin Newsom, senior analyst with DTN, a market information service. "It doesn't matter what the price is at this point." Other commodities prices also fell.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 30.85, or 3.7%, to 876.07, and the Nasdaq Composite added 63.75, or 4.4%, to 1509.31. Gains in all the S&P's sectors were led by financials, up 6.9%. The S&P was down 2.3% for the week.
Treasury prices fell as investors turned to stocks, pushing up yields. The benchmark 10-year note shed 26/32 point to 109 16/32 to yield 2.657%, up from 2.569% Thursday. But yield on the two-year note remained below 1%, at 0.932%.
