"While BofA's reported income beat expectations, this was easily overshadowed by dour estimates of rapidly escalating charge-offs for uncollectible loans," said Dan Cook, market analyst at IG Markets. The New York Times reported the government may stabilize the financial sector again, this time converting preferred shares in some banks into common stock to provide more capital, much as was done with the last Citigroup rescue.

Stocks slid as investors worried banks would need another round of assistance from the government despite a profit report from Bank of America.
Bank of America dropped $2.58, or 24%, to $8.02. First-quarter profit rose to $4.25 billion, helped by the recent acquisition of brokerage Merrill Lynch. Retail and commercial banking and credit-card and mortgage businesses were hurt by defaults, and the bank set aside more money to cover bad loans.
"While BofA's reported income beat expectations, this was easily overshadowed by dour estimates of rapidly escalating charge-offs for uncollectible loans," said Dan Cook, market analyst at IG Markets. "As we continue to shed jobs here in the U.S., it is likely that more and more of these loans will continue to default. This is a major concern for not just Bank of America, but all of the major banks."
While the flood of red ink evidently slowed at banks during the first quarter, questions about their viability in a prolonged recession remain. The New York Times reported the government may stabilize the financial sector again, this time converting preferred shares in some banks into common stock to provide more capital, much as was done with the last Citigroup rescue.
Speculation about the progress of bank stress tests surfaced in the blogosphere.
Shares of Citi declined 71 cents, or 19%, to 2.94. Traders said many of the gains for Citi recently were linked to a share-supply issue after a stock conversion was delayed.
Like BofA, Citi's credit-card unit was a drag on earnings in the first quarter.
Among other credit-card issuers, American Express fell 2.83, or 13%, to 18.98; Capital One Financial fell 4.47, or
25%, to 13.38.

A reawakening of the deal market has provided some hope for stock-market bulls.
Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq) surged 2.46, or 37%, to 9.15 after the server and software maker agreed to a $7.4 billion buyout from acquisitive business-software maker Oracle.
Oracle fell 24 cents, or 1.3%, to 18.82.
International Business Machines, which had come close to buying Sun, fell 84 cents, or 0.8%, to 100.43. After the bell, shares fell further as the computer-services giant posted a decline in first-quarter profit but stuck by its profit projection for 2009.
PepsiCo fell 2.27, or 4.4%, to 49.86 after the soda maker posted a decline in first-quarter profit and offered to buy out two of its bottlers for a total of roughly $6 billion. Pepsi Bottling Group rose 5.53, or 22%, to 30.73. PepsiAmericas rose 5.16, or 26%, to 25.04.
Texas Instruments fell 65 cents, or 3.6%, to 17.32. Shares rebounded after hours as the chip maker surprised Wall Street with a first-quarter profit and said it would increase production in the second quarter.
Many industrial and material stocks slid as the recent bounce for commodity prices was interrupted. Oil prices fell 8.8% on economic worries and signs of a glut in supply.
Shares of fertilizer maker Mosaic declined 2.85, or 6.8%, to 39.33; aluminum maker and Dow component Alcoa fell 90 cents, or 9.7%, to 8.36.
Eaton declined 4.33, or 9.7%, to 40.42 after the maker of industrial components warned of a 5% drop in sales at its aerospace unit this year.
Pulte Homes fell 98 cents, or 8.4%, to 10.66. Several home builders sold off after small-cap Lennar reserved money to cover lawsuits related to damaged drywall in Florida.
General Motors fell 20 cents, or 11%, to 1.66 after the auto maker said it is cutting 1,600 more jobs in the next few days as it races to avoid bankruptcy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 289.60 points, or 3.6%, to 7841.73, its largest percentage drop since March 5, shortly before it hit its bear-market closing low on March 9. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite fell 64.86, or 3.9%, to 1608.21. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 37.21, or 4.3%, to 832.39.
