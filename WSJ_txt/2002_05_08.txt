"I can't persuade myself that this necessarily marks some overall alteration in the fundamentals," Mr. [J. Thomas Madden] said. "First and foremost, it is smelling a little like a technical snapback," coming after the Nasdaq index had fallen during 13 of the previous 15 trading sessions and at a time when the volatile Nasdaq still is 66% off its record close in March 2000.
The Nasdaq composite, dominated by beleaguered technology stocks, surged 122.47 points to 1696.29. Nasdaq volume was 2.38 billion shares, the heaviest of the year. The index still is down 13% so far this year, but it has recovered all its losses of the previous seven trading days.
The increase eclipses the big gains the index had registered on a few days this year, such as a 71-point gain on March 1 and a 63-point advance on April 16. It is the largest gain for the Nasdaq since it soared 8.12%, or 156.22 points, on April 18, 2001. It exceeded even the one-day gains of 5% to 6% that the index recorded during its rebound in September and October following the terrorist attacks.

A GENTLE HINT from Cisco Systems about a possible coming business recovery was enough to spark a monster stock rally, sending the Nasdaq Composite Index up 7.78%, its biggest one-day gain in more than one year and its eighth-largest percentage gain ever.
Bonds fell sharply as investors fled them, for a day at least, to join in the stock rally, which also saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average soar more than 300 points -- its biggest gain since September.
But investors debated whether the stock market has lastingly shaken off its doldrums. Many said the rally was based more on technical trading flukes than on fundamental changes in the corporate-earnings outlook. They noted that on almost all the previous occasions when the Nasdaq has risen this much in one day, it has given back all the gains in the course of the next few months.
All the same, the rally was "very impressive, very, very impressive," said John O'Donoghue, co-head of listed trading at brokerage firm Credit Suisse First Boston. After stocks surged in the morning, he said, some traders postponed planned purchases, expecting stocks to pull back in the afternoon, as they have on so many earlier days. Instead, stocks continued gaining, forcing some of the skeptical traders to jump in near day's end and push stocks still higher.
Can the gains continue? Perhaps, but many investors think that, with corporate earnings prospects still uncertain, the market is in for difficult days.
"I think it is going to be volatile and range-bound for a while here, perhaps through the summer," said J. Thomas Madden, chief investment officer at Pittsburgh mutual-fund group Federated Investors. He expects that stocks eventually will rally sharply, but probably not for some months to come.
"I can't persuade myself that this necessarily marks some overall alteration in the fundamentals," Mr. Madden said. "First and foremost, it is smelling a little like a technical snapback," coming after the Nasdaq index had fallen during 13 of the previous 15 trading sessions and at a time when the volatile Nasdaq still is 66% off its record close in March 2000.
Even so, the gains were a breath of fresh air.
The Nasdaq composite, dominated by beleaguered technology stocks, surged 122.47 points to 1696.29. Nasdaq volume was 2.38 billion shares, the heaviest of the year. The index still is down 13% so far this year, but it has recovered all its losses of the previous seven trading days.
The increase eclipses the big gains the index had registered on a few days this year, such as a 71-point gain on March 1 and a 63-point advance on April 16. It is the largest gain for the Nasdaq since it soared 8.12%, or 156.22 points, on April 18, 2001. It exceeded even the one-day gains of 5% to 6% that the index recorded during its rebound in September and October following the terrorist attacks.
The tech gains pulled almost all the other indexes up as well. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 3.1%, or 305.28 points, propelling the blue-chip barometer once again above the 10000 mark to 10141.83.
That was the largest gain in point or percentage terms for the industrial average since Sept. 24, when it rose 4.47%, or 368.05 points, as it began its rebound from the terrorist attacks. It was the 16th time that the Dow average has moved across the 10000 line, a level it has repeatedly surpassed and then sagged below since first finishing above 10000 on March 29, 1999. That has left the industrial average back where it was three years ago, but up 1% since this year began.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 3.75%, or 39.36 points, to 1088.85, still down 5% for the year.
The dollar gained, as money flowed into U.S. stocks from abroad.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks soared. On the Big Board, where 1.5 billion shares traded, 2,017 stocks rose and 1,173 fell.

Bonds declined. The 30-year bond was down 1 26/32 to yield 5.662%.
The dollar strengthened. Late in New York, it traded at 128.77 yen, up from 127.91, while the euro fell against the dollar to 90.42 cents from 91.56.
