After the worst week for stocks of the past decade, gallows humor is in vogue again on Wall Street: Time to break out those “Dow 10000" caps, the traders say: we could be using them more than once.
They are talking about the blue baseball caps handed out on the New York Stock Exchange floor back In March, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average first went through the landmark 10000 level. Now, like a modern-day Wrong Way Corrigan, the aviator who departed from New York In 1938 for California and wound up In Ireland, the blue-chip Index is flirting with 10000 again, this time from the wrong direction.
Once again, investors are debating: Is this a momentous event, or is it just a number? The answer: It may be just a number, but it is a big, round one that Is sendlnga chill down people's spines. When the blue-chip Index sank briefly below 10000, to 9998.18, about an hour before the close, a roar of pain erupted on the exchange floor, followed by a roar of relief when the industrials qi Into five-digit territory.
heaviest in percentage terms since Oct. 1 of last year.
But more significant, the Dow Industrials recorded their worst-ever point drop for a calendar week, falling 630.05 points from Monday through Friday. It was the heaviest weekly percentage drop in ID years, since October 1989.
Further, the Index Is down 11.53% from , Its Aug. 25 record of 11326.04. A fall of ■ 10% or more often Is described as a "cor-rectlon."	.
People re-evaiuate things when such a , prominent index revisits such a special ' milestone as 10000. At best, they decide** stocks are cheap. At worst, they decide the market will get worse before It gets better. Moreover, bad Fridays In the past some-;;\ times have been followed by worse Mon-.J days - and sometimes by big Monday re-. > bounds.
This bull market has taken more than one analyst by surprise, of course. But -F bearish analysts, who long have consld- , cred the stock market overvalued, are'. saying that this drop Is finally lhe sign that ■ the bull market is over.	•
"The level itself, the number itself, doesn’t mean anything,” says Tim Hayes, senior stock strategist al Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. "It Is the attention given to the level that has an impact on lhe market. As you break through 1KW again, the recognition that we are in a down trend becomes more pronounced, and lhe recognition that we are In a bear market gets more pronounced."
Nonsense, say the bulls. That was wrong before, and It will be wrong again. The most fervent bulls say slocks aren't going to close below 10600 at all. They note that stocks bounced right back when they fell below 10000 on Friday as buyers stepped in.
But even some bullish analysts say that

the stock market still doesn't look cheap. Il got ahead of Itself this year, they say, and it may have to fall below 10000 before ; buyers really step in.
"The market certainly isn't at great ■ risk anymore now," says PalneWcbber ' investment strategist Edward Kerschner. . ajongstanding bull, but it only has fallen, back to (air value. "It Just Isn’t cheap yet," ' he says.

In the interim, he :: cautions, they could go even lower, which ; ,ymuld bc Va great time to buy." rVi;0ver theweekend, millions of stock-‘holders were asking themselves what, if ' anything, to do about the market drop; - how they answered the question will help determine where stocks go from here.
Some active traders are getting discouraged. Christine Hobson, who trades stocks lull time from home la Santa Clara, Calif., says she mode $600 Friday buying beaten-down stocks early in the day and selling them within an hour, before the market's steepest drop. But over a recent three-week period, she lost between 512,000 and 514,000, she says. "I cannot make money, basically," she adds, although she says she still Is up for the year.
The cause of lust week's pain was a combination of Inflation fears and disappointing corporate-earnings reports. Following Friday's (at wholesale-price numbers, Investors fear that Inflation Is worse than the optimists thought, and that higher interest rates and sluggish financial markets are In store as the Federal Reserve
Those fixated on historical coincidences note that in both 1929 and 1987, stocks crashed 55 days after their peak. ’ Tomorrow will be 55 calendar days after • the Industrials peaked Aug. 25.
Out most investors say that what wor-, ries them is less.exotlc. It Is the Idea that .stocks now.are going through something a -lot worse than a correction: a “stealth*' bear market. * ‘ ' i The most common definition of a bear market is a 20% decline from a high. The industrials would have to fall another 958 points to hit that level. But unlike the Indexes, the average stock is more than 20% off Ils high and has been for weeks. What keeps the Indexes up is a handful of huge glamour stocks such as Microsoft, Generat Electric. Cisco Systems and International Business Machines, which weigh heavily In the indexes. IBM, for example, actually finished Friday up.
“The Inner workings of (he market don’t seem right, ft Is very unsettling," says Michael Weiner, portfolio manager al Banc One Investment Advisors In Columbus, Ohio.
“The concern I am hearing Isn't Dow 10000 per se. What I am hearing is the thought that what we are seeing In the indexes Isn't indicative of the broader market. It's hard to know how to make your next Investment. If a client gives you money, you have to decide what to do with it, and It Isn't easy.”

Dow 10000 Redux Renews Debate
Dn the Milestone’s Significance
Continued From Page Cl iow are confirming Ills views. He recently ent a commentary to clients suggesting hat by various market measures, notably me that measures the performance of the tread market rather than the Indexes, we ilready are In a bear market. That, he ays, will become official when the indexes oln lhe majority of stocks by falling the equislte 20%.
More-bullish stock strategists, such as dr. Kerschner of PaineWebber and Abby loseph Cohen at Goldman Sachs, say that docks will have trouble matching past pins of 20% a year and more. But given the ow level of Inflation, the economy's itrength and the continuing gains In corpo-•ate earnings, they say, stocks also aren't ikely to fall very heavily.
Mr. Hayes is more pessimistic. The low Industrials have tripled since early 1993 and have multiplied in value more han tenfold since they began their pro-onged bull run In 1982. At some point, he hlnks, they will have todigest these gains. Hie Inst time they paused for serious digestion, after the stock boom ot the 1950s, he picture wasn't too pretty. From the jarly 1960s until 1982. stocks essentially went nowhore-for about 20 years.
More perplexing, all of this happened iround the time the industrials were hitting 1000 for the first time. They first touched 1OTO during a trading day In WGG, but didn’t actually finish tiic day above that level until 1972. Then they bounced up and down for a decade and didn't move lastingly above 1000 until 1982.
When the industrials first moved above 100OT, this year, some stock watchers worried that they could get stuck at that level, as they did at the 1000 level. They noted that the Industrials also had some trouble gelling past the 6000 and 9000 levels. The bulls shrug this off, noting that Inflation still Isn't the worry that it was In the 1970s, that the government Isn't running up a budget deficit ns it was then, and that the U.S. Isn't involved in anything approaching the Vietnam War, as It was then.
True, says Mr.Hayes: "Every period is different. But I was out seeing clients, and that question kept coming up."
There are, he says, troubling parallels. Oil prices are rising again, us they were then, as are gold and other commodities. Market gains are focused on a handful of market darlings, as they were then. The bond yield started below G% and then moved higher then, as it did this year. History won't necessarily repeat Itself, Mr. Hayes says, but "actually, there are quite a few similarities."
