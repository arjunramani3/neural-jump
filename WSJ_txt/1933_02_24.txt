compi«t» tabulation ot the Dow-Jonea ages, with charts. ascotui from last pape.
A. respite from bad news, rather than any stimulating; developments, brought about a recovery in security prices yesterday. After a period of acute weakness in the first half hour of trading, stocks turned upward, led by the carrier shares, and were firm the remainder of the session. The close found the list not far from the day’s highs, in a quiet market. Trading volume was under that of the preceding day, and the rally was accompanied by a falling off in the pace of transactions.	.
Government bonds led the bond market upward. Some of the pressure on Governments was lifted in the late trading Thursday, and the Government department was strong from the opening gong yesterday. With Governments reversing their recent downtrend, domestic corporation bonds managed to stage a brisk recovery. High-grade and junior railroad liens and utility bonds pushed up for fair gains after a period of early Irregularity. Recent heavy pressure on the market was lacking.
Wheat and cotton advanced, too. Wheat finished up to % cents a bushel, and cotton was 8 to 12 points higher at the finish. The foreign exchange market was quiet, with the dollar stronger against sterling.
Circulation Increase Foreseen
Wall Street had been expecting the Federal Reserve statement to show wide increase in currency circulation. While the increase of §134,000,000 reported was large, and out of line with the normal seasonal movement, it was as large as anticipated in some quarters. The effect of the increase was felt in the early dealings in stocks, but it did not bring in much new liquidation.
Overnight news included the cut in the Union Carbide common dividend, this time to a 25-cent quarterly basis. Other items were a number of annual reports, a few good ones. Like that of Continental Can. among them. The banking situation, the £rime influence on the securities markets for 10 days, showed little change, and Wall Street was disposed to take the view that "no news was good news.”
The early selling found railroad shares offering a sturdy resistance at around the October 10 bottom prices. Atchison gave way, but Union Pacific, New York Central, Louisville & Nashville and Chesapeake & Ohio were notably firm in the face of the selling in the industrials and utilities. The resistance shown by the rails led to some short covering, and a little speculative buying for a rally. The list started ahead, led by the carriers, and by noon gains of a point or more were sprinkled quite liberally through the list.
Stronger as Hay Advances
The market gathered strength as the day wore on. American Telephone, United States Steel preferred and Coca Cola were strong spots among the industrials, and American Can came to the fore in the late dealings. Among the rails, Delaware & Hudson had a sharp run-up, finishing at 44, up 3^ on the day. Gains ran up to as much as 4% points in the active leaders. Chrysler and Radio, among the trading favorites, were heavy, -with the former closing off on the day.
Stocks were strong in Faris, but in London the market was irregular, on the whole. Oil shares did better than any other group.
New Debt Hurts Roads
Monthly statements of some of the indigent
carriers show how the contraction of new debts, in the form of loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corp, or the Railroad Credit Corp., is noting as a brake on their ability to show any upturn in net income, even though they are improving operating income figures. The Fere Marquette, for instance, had larger operating income in January than in January, 2932, but the road's deficit after charges this year was higher.
Loans to railroads, to forestall receivership by enabling them to continue to meet maturities and fixed charges, to say nothing of paying off back bills and overdue taxes, have postponed a day of reckoning. Without a very substantial rise in traffic, which is not indicated at this time, the loans weigh heavily on the carriers which have contracted them. While they have prevented receivership in the past, they now mean a swifter approach toward the time when the .carrier must make new loans, or reorganize.
Selling In Bonds
The bond market tape was studded on Thursday, and again yesterday, with delayed delivery transactions. Some of these represented shortselling in bonds, particularly in the highest grade railroad and public utility bonds, by a few active traders, who anticipated that the wave of selling of high grade bonds from banking institutions would drive prices sharply lower.
Houses with foreign connections received pretty substantial selling orders on Thursday, and again yesterday. Selling was In both bonds and stocks.
Another Tumble for Exchange Seats
The market for Stock Exchange seats has been inactive recently, but yesterday a transaction was announced at §90,000, off 510,000 from the previous sale and a new low for the year. Prices for seats have covered a wide range in the last 14 months. The high for the period was $185,000 and the low, set last summer, was $6S.000. Yesterday’s price is still 25% above the previous bottom figure.
The Canning Companies
With the two major canning companies* annual reports for 1932 in, some interesting comparisons between them can bo made. American Can's depreciation charge in 1932 was the customary S2.000,000. while Continental Can set by $2,343,701 for that account. In view of the fact that American Can's plants and real estate are valued on the balance sheet at $140.729,948, while Continental Can’s total for this item is only $39,926,S69, the disparity in these two accounts seems wide. However, last year American Can spent only about half as much on new construction as did Continental Can.
Continental Can’s sole capital liability is 1,733.345 shares of capital stock. At the close of the year, the company's cash holdings alone were equal, after deducting all current liabilities, to almost $6.60 a share on the capital stock. While American Can was in strong shape at the end of 1932. there was no such margin of cash behind each of its common shares.
At current prices, American Can is selling for just about 16 times 1932 per share earnings, and Continental Can for about 13.3 times per share figures for last year. American On yields about 7.7% on the current $4 annual rate, and Continental Can about 7.3%.
Vnfillod Orders
Unfilled orders of Westinghouse at the yoar-end stood at about 30% below the total at the close of 1931, hardly optimistic on tbe company’s prospects for the current year. Both Westinghouse and General Electric have suffered from the fact that the utility companies are not buying any heavy equipment, and are putting very little money into new construction of any kind. Both Westinghouse and General Electric, however, since the year-end have felt some quickening in demand for their products from other buyers.
