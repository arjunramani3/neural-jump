U.S. stocks tumbled to their lowest levels since a late August rout, as investors punished the year's biggest winners and losers alike in a search for profits in the market's downturn.
Monday's broad declines signaled further volatility could be ahead in sectors beyond energy and raw materials, which investors have hammered as commodity prices have tumbled.
"The concerns that triggered the drop in stock prices in August are still with us," said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. Investors are "selling the winners," she said. "When investors get nervous about the overall market they sell everything and then figure out what things they shouldn't have sold."
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 312.78 points, or 1.9%, to 16001.89, dipping below 16000 for the first time since Sept. 1 on an intraday basis. The S&P 500 fell 49.57 points, or 2.6%, to 1881.77. Both indexes posted their biggest percentage and point declines since Sept. 1. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 142.53 points, or 3%, to 4543.97.
The selloff continued early Tuesday in Asia. Japan's Nikkei was down 3.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 3.7%, Australia's S&PASX 200 was off 2.7% and the Shanghai Composite was down 1.5%.
In the U.S. Monday, health-care and biotechnology stocks fell sharply.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International fell $32.97, or 17%, to $166.50, after Democrats on the House Oversight Committee asked the panel's chairman to force Valeant to provide documents explaining price increases for two heart drugs.
The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index dropped 6%, erasing gains for the year. The index posted six straight years of gains through 2014.
Last week, biotechnology stocks fell after Hillary Clinton targeted specialty drug makers, tweeting about a plan that would counter "price gouging" and proposing new rules that would control prescription-drug spending.
Investors were selling stocks to try to extract profits from a tumultuous quarter, analysts said. They are "selling their best assets," said Jeffrey Yu, head of single stock derivatives trading at UBS Group.
Jim Hartwell, president and chief executive of Deer Park, Ill.-based asset manager Essex LLC, which has about $200 million under management, said he has reduced exposure to biotech stocks by about 15% over the past year because the sector had appreciated so much. "It's been performing so well," he said, adding that his strategy for the remainder of the year is to "just buy into the weakness of companies you want to own in the long term."
Investors sold even some of the year's most resilient stocks.
The S&P Food Products index, which includes Campbell Soup and Hershey, fell 3% on Monday. The index is still up 2.1% this year. Campbell dropped 87 cents, or 1.7%, to 50.80, while Hershey slid 1.28, or 1.4%, to 91.28.
Energy and raw-material-producing companies also declined as commodity prices fell after a report showed industrial profits in China dropped 8.8% in August from a year ago. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan lost 89 cents, or 9.1%, to 8.91.
Energy stocks slid along with a 2.8% drop in crude-oil prices. The S&P energy sector fell 3.6%. Chesapeake Energy lost 68 cents, or 9.2%, to 6.71.
Williams fell 5.04, or 12%, to 36.56, after Energy Transfer Equity said it would buy the rival pipeline operator for about $32.6 billion.
Alcoa rose 52 cents, or 5.7%, to 9.59, after the aluminum maker said it would split into two publicly traded companies, one focusing on mining and refining and the other on more finished industrial products.
Concern over a slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy, and its potential impact on the Federal Reserve's plans to normalize monetary policy after years of rock-bottom rates, has fueled market volatility in recent weeks.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley on Monday said the central bank will likely raise interest rates this year. Mr. Dudley also emphasized that a rate
increase could come possibly as early as October. The Fed has two remaining scheduled policy meetings this year, one in October and another in December. That intensifies
the focus on Friday's nonfarm payrolls report for September, the last one before the Fed's October meeting. Last week, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen argued the case for

raising rates later this year.
Some investors interpreted the Fed's decision to keep short-term rates near zero at its meeting in September as a lack of confidence in the U.S. economic recovery.
If the central bank doesn't raise rates, it could have an even worse effect on share prices, said Keith Bliss, senior vice president at brokerage Cuttone. "If we're in an economic situation where we can't support [a quarter-point rate increase], then we're in bigger trouble than we all realize," he said.
