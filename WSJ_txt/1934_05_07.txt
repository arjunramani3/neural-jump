sigTi. T «qt year, the month, to month change In volume was greater than usual, due to the sharp upturn in buying following the slump during the HnnU holiday- The month to month gain this year indicates that farmer resistance to rising prices hasn't become serious so far and that farm buying power still is fairly high. The month's business volume Indicates that Ward was well in the black for the latest period.
Russian Trade Difficulties
The ruling interpreting the Johnson Rill makes prospects for any important increase in business with Soviet Russia dependent on a debt settlement agreement. How soon that will come is in the realm of conjecture. Weakness in the farm implement company shares yesterday was due partly to the interpretation of the measure. The companies, however, have other troubles. Their costs are up more than they have raised prices and. even though their balance sheet positions are being improved by payments on old debts from the farmers, the outlook for new business is not encouraging.
Disparities in the Steel Figure*
Monthly figures on steel production, issued by the American Iron & Steel Institute, show a surprising conflict with the weekly operating figures which come from the same source, and cover identical units of the industry. In April the highest weekly rate forecast was by the Institute was 54 0%, but the average for the month, according to the figures issued by the Institute, was at 54.19r,r. Ever since the Institute began issuing weekly figures in addition to its monthly reports similar disparities have been shown.
Last month's total output of 2.935.000 tons exceeded the total for August. 1933. and was only slightly below the figure for July of 1933. While tonnage produced in April exceeded that of March, actual shipments, which are the index of profits, were lower last month than in the previous month. March, the closing month of the first quarter, saw a big bulge in shipments, due to the operations of the steel code. Nevertheless, the steel industry as a whole was in the black last month, getting off to a good start on the second quarter of the year. Current output figures indicate that May will be another money making month for the steel producers.
Now Lows Reached
At last night's close, the Dow-Jones industrial average was at 95.51. off 2 69 and the lowest since December 20. when stocks were depressed by tax selling. The rail average 43 .0, was at the lowest level since January 15. In both cases, the March bottom levels were penetrated by more than a full point.

decline in trade is evident in various directions, there are as yet no indications the slump will be more than seasonal. In Washington, predictions were made that the Lower House of Congress would be ready for adjournment within days. The silver question still is under consideration by the President. The Senate began debate on the Fletcher-Rayburn bill. .
domestic corporation bonds worked lower, but losses were not steep in most cases. Government obligations ranged higher on the day.
Wheat was not the only commodity to gain ground. Cotton closed up $1.25 a bale, and silver futures were higher. Rubber advanced 1 to 8 points.
In the London market, prices moved irregularly upward. In Paris, the list was strong, except for rentes.
Money, Stocks and Costs
The major influence which has contributed to raising the price of bonds and high-gr£de preferred stocks is the plethora of idle funds seeking investment, and extremely low money rates. Tn the long run, there should be a slop-over of such funds into common stocks, but they will go into stocks which offer fair yields and where the earnings trend is upward. The chief difficulty prospective investors in common shares arp having now is estimating how far rising ; costs will go to offset rising gross revenues. In ' the steel companies, the farm equipment companies and some of the motor companies, rising costs are upsetting calculations as to improvements in net income available for distribution to stockholders. In the face of such uncertainties, 5 many managpra of investment funds are sticking to bonds and preferred stocks
Public Debt Drop* in Apx
The $37,000,000 drop in the g^ emment's debt during April afforded a temporary break in the sustained uptrend, due to the government's spending program. The small decline still leaves the government’s obligations within shooting distance of the post-war high, and they

lows. A part of in some points.
The heaviest volume of selling which has hit stocks since the current reaction got under way was encountered, and prices gave way all along the line. The stock ticker ran as much as 5 minutes behind actual floor transactions, and a long list of pivotal stocks set new lows for the year. Volume moved up to 2,360.000 shares, the highest since February 16.
While all groups of stocks were heavy, railroad shares gave way more easily than the industrials during the forepart of the session. Late in the day. however, motors, steels and oils were ______o_________ .	_	_

steel group. Republic Iron & Steel, U. S. Steel common, Bethlehem and American*'Rolling Mill all were off around 2 points at one time. Atchison, Great Northern, New York Central, Central and Baltimore & Ohio were weak spots in the rail group.
American Telephone and Consolidated Gas were the soft spots among the utilities again. Telephone held above its 1934 bottom, but Gas touched a new low, and was only fractionally above the all-time low of 31 set in the summer of 1932. Other stocks tn the group were soft.
Nothing in tho week-end news afforded any explanation for the new wave of selling. So far as business is concerned, the outlook is little changed.
Steel operations, at the outset of the week, are at a new high for the upturn. While some
