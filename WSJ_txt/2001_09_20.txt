Analysts pointed to several stocks that have taken severe hits, including Dow industrials components Disney and American Express. Traders said that the sale of the Disney shares, handled by Goldman Sachs, went very smoothly, and that a number of mutual funds and other money-management groups were eager for them, given that Disney has lost about 60% of its value and still is considered a fundamentally strong company.
Overall, the market value of U.S. stocks has fallen about 10% on paper, or about $1.19 trillion, to about $10.43 trillion, since stocks resumed trading Monday. That is based on the market value of the companies in the Wilshire 5000 index, a total of about 7,200 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company with headquarters in the U.S. Since the index's peak at a market value of about $16.96 trillion on March 24, 2000, its value is down about 38.5%, or about $6.53 trillion. Yesterday, the index's market value fell about 3%, or $327.20 billion.
Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 2.80%, or 3.19 points, to 110.80.

Hopes for a stock-market rally, which had blossomed late Wednesday, faded again in the face of a wave of selling.
Stocks have suffered seven consecutive days of declines, including all four days since trading resumed Monday. Under the weight of the selling, traders, some of whom can see the wreckage of the World Trade Center as they walk to work, are beginning to tire and to look forward to a weekend respite.
Analysts who track trading activity said the average trade size remains much larger than usual, indicating that the great majority of the selling is being done by large institutions, such as hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds. But some mutual funds also began reporting signs that individual investors are pulling back from stocks.
In another day of heavy trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.37%, or 382.92 points, to 8376.21, slipping for the first time since February 1998 below the 8400 level. The Nasdaq Composite Index held up a little better, as the selling focused mainly on smokestack stocks that are heavily represented in the industrials, and no longer are expected to benefit from an economic upturn anytime soon.
The Nasdaq index fell 3.72%, or 56.87 points, to 1470.93. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.11%, or 31.56 points, to 984.54, finishing below 1000 for the first time since early 1998. The Nasdaq composite has lost all its gains since July 8, 1997.
Since trading resumed Monday, the industrials have fallen 12.8%, or 1,229.30 points, while the Nasdaq composite is down 13.2%, or 224.45 points.
Treasury bonds fell amid continuing worries that government spending to prop up the economy and finance the military will put an end to the government surplus, forcing the issuance of more bonds and possibly causing inflation.
As for the stock selling, "I wouldn't be surprised to see it continue," said David Testa, chief investment officer at Baltimore mutual-fund group T. Rowe Price. He said the large volumes had some of the hallmarks of "capitulation" selling, which can mark the end of a downturn as large numbers of disheartened investors sell their stock, permitting new, less pessimistic investors to buy and lead the market back up.
But he added that, given the political and economic uncertainty, the selling might not give way to buying before next week at the soonest. "Friday, you will have a lot of uncertainty. The president will have spoken, airplanes will be moving around, and there will be a lot to worry about" during the weekend, he said.
Vanguard, the nation's second-largest mutual-fund group, said individual investors were sellers of stock funds for the first time this week. Brian Mattes, a spokesman for the Malvern, Pa., company, said telephone calls from the company's fund investors rose to the busiest levels of the week, and that most people who made changes were moving from stock funds to money-market funds.
One investor explained, "I'm retiring in three months and I can't take the risk," according to Mr. Mattes's recollection.
T. Rowe Price also reported high phone volume through early afternoon, and the strongest tendencies yet this week to seek safety in money-markets and fixed-income
funds.
"We're starting to see some exchange and redemption activity that we weren't seeing as much of earlier in the week," T. Rowe spokesman Brian Lewbart said. He said the shift doesn't represent a sea change in investor sentiment, but suggests investors are more worried than they were earlier this week. The company said phone calls from individual investors yesterday afternoon were up about 7% and calls from retirement-plan investors were up 40%.
Janus, a large fund group in Denver, said telephone volume was up yesterday, although it didn't see a trend in the type of transactions.
The selling by large institutions seemed to be strong and sustained, but not what you could call panic selling, said Laszlo Birinyi, whose market-research group Birinyi Associates, of Westport, Conn., tracks New York Stock Exchange trading activity.

"The orders are larger than usual, probably reflecting that institutions are more aggressive," he said. But "the lesson to be learned is that it isn't over yet" because it hasn't yet reached panic levels.
Rumors have circulated that some of the selling is being provoked by investors who bought stock with borrowed money and are falling victim to "margin calls," or demands to repay the loans because the stock has fallen below the loan's value. A spokesman for billionaire investor Sid Bass confirmed that Mr. Bass and other members of his Texas family had been forced to sell 135 million shares of Walt Disney, in part to pay off margin loans, analysts say.
Despite that high-profile move, Mr. Birinyi said what he was seeing was more consistent with aggressive selling by large investment institutions, rather than margin calls.
Mr. Testa said it looked like panic selling to him, which ultimately could be a positive thing if it marks the end of the slowdown.
"In recent times, it is more the professionals who tend to be the emotional reactors," and not individuals, he said. "It isn't us and it probably isn't the other firms like us, but somebody out there is heaving stock over the side at the moment. And that's what you've got to see to get things cleaned out. And you are hitting price points that make stocks attractive now for the first time in a long time."

When you peel back the verbiage, two things are at work in the stock market, and neither is positive. Some investors fear that the two could combine to hold stocks down for some time, perhaps for weeks.
The first is that traders still have no idea how low stocks can go. The sharp bounce at the end of trading Wednesday made some think that stocks had found a new level of stability, at about 8500 on the Dow industrials. Yesterday blew a hole through that hope, although many persist in the view that stocks are nearing their lows.
The second problem is that a lot of the assumptions that had supported high stock valuations are unraveling. Investors had believed that stock prices could remain unusually high compared with corporate earnings because of unprecedented productivity, world peace and the free flow of people and capital around the world. With war at hand and many companies announcing unexpected operating problems, those assumptions are being questioned. Investors are responding by pushing down ratios of stock prices to corporate-earnings projections. Since earnings projections are falling, that means prices are falling even faster.
Some positive news emerged during the day, but it was far from enough to calm investor nerves. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in a Senate appearance that, while the economy is going to suffer during the short term, its basic, strong underpinnings haven't changed.
A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia indicated that the economy was continuing to slow, but at a reduced pace.
Negative corporate news continued to hit the market, reinforcing worries that the next few moths will bring more bad news on corporate earnings.
Among the immediate problems were announcements of staff cuts by AMR's American Airlines, UAL's United Airlines and Applied Materials, a big supplier of equipment to makers of computer chips.
Trading also continued to be affected by the so-called triple witching expiration of futures contracts and of options contracts on stocks and stock indexes.
The Dow industrials are 28.55% off their record close of 11722.98, set on Jan. 14, 2000. The Nasdaq composite has fallen 70.9% since its record close of 5048.62 on March 10 of that year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is 35.5% off its record close, 1527.46, hit on March 24 of last year.
Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 2.80%, or 3.19 points, to 110.80.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks retreated. On the Big Board, where 1.94 billion shares traded, 549 stocks rose and 2,637 fell.
The dollar weakened. Late in New York, it traded at 116.29 yen, down from 117.67, while the euro rose against the dollar to 92.75 cents from 92.68.
