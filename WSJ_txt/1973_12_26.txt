Abreast of the Market
By VlCTUk J. HlIXEKY
A brightening of the oil-supply picture sent the stock market bounding ahead sharply over a wide front yesterday in fairly active trading
The surge followed the Christmas news that Arab nations were relaxing their petroleum output curbs by lowering to 15% from 2591 the slash from September's operating rate and canceling a further 5% cutback scheduled for next month Additional thrust was provided, said Leslie M. Pollack, vice president of Hayden Stone Inc., by indications that the Arabs' oil embargo, which will continue for the U.S., the Netherlands and some other countries, is "more of a sieve than an embargo and that the shortage isn’t as bad as had been feared.”
The Dow Jones industrial average, which eased almost four points on Monday, jumped 20.52 points in the first hour yesterday. It halved this gain during the second hour but then started climbing again. It finished at 837.56, up 22.75 points, its biggest gain since it spurted 23.93 points on Dec. 7. The transportation indicator scored an even greater percentage rise—4.65% against 2.79%. The utility average rose, too.
Indicative of the advance’s broad sweep were the 1,204 New York Stock Exchange gainers, more than three times the 358 iosers. Stocks sinking to new 1973 lows fell to 65 from 159 Monday, and new highs climbed to 22 from 9.
Big Board trading, at its briskest pace during the opening hours, swelled to 18,620,000 shares from 11,540,000 Monday; the exchanges were closed Christmas Day. Yesterday also was a holiday in some European countries. An acceleration of institutional activity was apparent from the rise in the trades of 10,000 shares or more to 70 from the prior session’s revised total of 51.
Another factor that lent support to the market yesterday, brokers said, was news that President Nixon was attempting to work out a program that would avoid gasoline rationing.
Mideast News Was Drag
A development that helped contribute to the market’s late morning retreat was news that Egypt and Israel dismissed each other's pullback proposals as unacceptable. Also, the market continued under some pressure from year-end switching and tax-loss selling.
Nicholas Davis, Boettcher & Co. partner in charge of research, said he is "quite bullish for the long term” because the market seems “oversold” and many stocks "offer very good values.” He said he believes the marl.^t has “fully discounted all the bad news” and that the recent “total investor pessimism” is typical of market bottoms.
The American Stock Exchange index climbed 1.07 to 86.29 and winners outdistanced losers about five-to-three. Turnover picked up to 3,360,000 shares from 2,200,000 Monday. Also higher was the National Association of Securities Dealers' NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter stocks; it ended at 90.19, up 1.52.
Strength on the Big Board was particularly evident in the computer, chemical and drug stocks yesterday, and they were joined by airline, housing, copper, retail, electronic, machinery, auto, oil, paper, television, rubber, savings-and-loan, steel and tobacco issues. Some golds, however, lost ground.
Just as many U.S. companies with overseas operations were hit Monday by fears that the sharp oil price increase would hurt foreign economies; these stocks benefited yesterday from the announcement of the relaxing of oil-production curbs. International Business Machines, which Monday bumped a 1973 low, yesterday spurted 11 to 248%. Burroughs climbed 13% to 200%; Texas Instruments, 6% to 103%; Xerox, 5% to 121% and Johnson & Johnson, 8% to 113%.
Prospects that gas rationing may be avoided helped companies that are dependent on highway travel. McDonald’s, which operates roadside fast-food establishments,
