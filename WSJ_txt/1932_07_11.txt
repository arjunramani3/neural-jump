stock <jver-
A switch of strength from bonds into stocks occurred at the start of the new week. Foreign bonds, which had proved the greatest attraction to speculative interests last week turned irregularly lower under profit taking, and the domestic list was irregular, although government bonds held steady. Wheat was fractionally lower, com was higher and cotton off.
After a shilly-shallying start, with a number of leading issues dipping to new lows, stocks worked higher, and closed near the day’s best levels. Auburn staged one of its spectacular upswings to touch off the rally, running up more than 12 points. In the last few minutes, the stock moved ahead swiftly and closed near the day’s high.
The day’s news included items that served to help confidence. Of prime interest was the fact that Fisher’s index of commodity prices, after advancing two weeks in succession, held unchanged. A number of weekly commodity pnee indices recently have testified to the greater stability in the commodity markets in general.
The President’s veto of the unemployment relief measure, announced just before the close of the markets, increased prospects for an early adjournment of Congress. It is regarded as probable that a substitute measure will be presented within the next day or two and pushed through Congress. In some quarters, it was held likely that Congress would adjourn at least by the middle of next week.
Vote on Borah Inflation Pleasure Disconcerting
The action of the Senate in adopting the Borah amendment to home loan discount bills, calling for a modicum of currency inflation, was a trifle disconcerting, particularly the vote by which the amendment was adopted. Wall Street was more interested in the vote on the beer rider to the measure.
While other groups of stocks were up more, the action of a number of the railroad issues in yesterday’s market attracted the most attention. A number of railroad stocks, including Atchison and Northern Pacific, held steady during the early weakness, and were the first to rally. There has been substantial buying in both Atchison and Northern Pacific recently, with the latter particularly favored in some quarters, due to the outlook for a good crop movement in coming montbs. Some buying has come into the rails, also, due to the fact that the Dow-Jones rail average so far has failed to confirm the recent break of the industrials through the low set May 31.
The action of the market yesterday again demonstrated the increasing resistance to declines. The early sinking spell in pivotal stocks failed to bring liquidation into the general list, and the market rallied rather easily. Conservative interests are inclined tn look for some extension of the recovery, although they dq not believe it will carry very far.
Ottawa Conference Am Recovery Factor
The business and political leaders who are gathering in Ottawa for the Imperial Economic Conference which will be convened July 21 seem likely to reach conclusions and adopt measures which will prove, in retrospect, to have been another of the major steps taken to put the world on the road to business recovery, though the immediate effects of results achieved at the
conference may be hard on United States foreign trade.
In bearing on the trade of this country, no more important matter is before tbe conference than that of tariffs. England and other units of the Empire are seeking tariff changes, to permit a freer flow of goods within the Empire, and to build up trade within tbe Empire. Canada, for instance, already has prepared a list of more than 8,000 items which it will admit free of duty from Empire countries, provided its bargaining conditions are met. For there will be bargaining between the various units of the Empire, just as there was bard trading at Lausanne.	.
Lower tariffs within the Empire will put business in the United States, competing with English industries, at a further disadvantage, and doubtless will lead to more agitation here for reciprocal tariff reductions.
The trend toward lower tariffs and elimination of other barriers which restrain the free flow’ of international trade, is clear. Belgium. Luxembourg and Holland recently agreed to a policy of reducing tariffs on Interchange goods which points to an eventual wiping out of tariffs as applied to each other’s products.
Buy $681,000 C. & E. I- Bonds For Sinking Fund for $76,800
A sample of what can be done in the way of retiring debt of railroads at current low prices for carrier obligations is afforded by the purchases made for the sinking fund on the Chicago & Eastern Illinois Railroad general mortgage 5CJ* bonds. For the May I sinking fund, a total of roughly $681,000 principal amount of bonds was purchased for approximately $76,800. The bonds are held alive in the sinking fund, and interest paid on them affords funds for further sinking fund acquisitions.
For many railroads, the burden of debt at the present time is paralyzing. The current level of earnings will not support it, and they have had to borrow’ to meet interest charges. Loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corp, to the carriers to meet interest charges simply constitute another burden for the carriers to carry, without any possibility that the loans will increase their revenues in any way.
If the Reconstruction Finance Corp, is to continue to make loans to the carriers, the soundest use for the loans would be to permit the railroads to buy in their own bonds at the current depreciated prices, and cut down their debt. Filing debt on to the carriers at the present time only will make the reckoning, when the time comes, more drastic.
Lake Coal Shipment* Continue Upward Move
The upward movement In dumpings of coal at Lake Erie ports is continuing, with the total for the week ended July 3 at 679,481 tons, about 40,000 more than in the previous week. While the total is still running sharply below* that for the corresponding 1931 weeks, the upswing is distinctly encouraging to the management of a road like the Chcaspeake & Ohio.
Through May and June. Chesapeake & Ohio did not experience the usual seasonal upswing m Lake coal shipments. With the increase m these shipments, earnings of j\hc Chesapeake & Ohio should turn up somewhvv and the July statement should show' better net income than either May or June. Early in June, the management declared that a sizeable pick-up in coal movement likely would not occur until midJuly.
