THE STOCK MARKET
ADVANCE CONTINUES
.	.	___I_
Strong- tone throughout the day drives i shorts to cover—U. S. Rubber common up nearly 15 points on talk of dividend resumption——United Retail Stores continues sensational advance—Call money as low as 3J%—Action of IT. S. Steel bears out reports of excellent scale buying that started around 105.
Dawes. He returns shortly and it is believed' that some news will be forthcoming regarding the. establishing of connections abroad for handling the, expbrt end of the company’s oil business. Recently the Oceanic Oil Co. was formed by Ohio Cities Gas Co. as a subsidiary to handle export business. Oil earnings now make up 90% of Ohio Cities Gas Co.’s income.	'	.
Sales. 1,375.700 shares.
Money was decidedly easier and loaned on call as low as 3%%. Brokers’ loans, as a result of the break in prices, have been reduced this week by at least 10%. The position of the market at present is undoubtedly a strong one.
United States Rubber common furnished the real fireworks of the day with a fifteen-point advance. Directors of the company will meet this afternoon and there is talk of a resumption of cash dividends with the possibility of some sort of a stock disbursement. All of the rubber companies are doing an immense business and almost without exception they will report a record gross for 1919. The rubber and tire companies of this country will probably divide close to $750,000,000 of business this year.
_ The boom among the rubber manufacturers is not entirely a result of the great demand for automobiles, although this is an important factor. Sales of mechanical rubber goods during the last month reached new high figures. Any further cut in ‘tire prices has been postponed until later in the year and may* not take place at all.
U. S. Steel led the steel group and at the high for the day was up nearly 4 points from the week’s low. Among the tobaccos United Retail Stores made a new record high and Lorillard Tobacco at its high was up over 14 points. A merger of Lorillard and Tobacco Products is more than a possibility.
Stocks Act Welt at the Opening
The entire list showed a better tone at the opening with advances in the lending issues running from an eighth of a point in Steel common which opened at 104%, to 1% in Baldwin at 103%. The foliowing few minutes of trading showed stocks to be fairly regular with volume rather small.
United Retail Stores opened at 109, up %, and after reacting fractionally advanced to 109%. B. R. T. at 27 W3s off %, apparently the strike of the carmen having little effect thus far.
U. S. Steel a Target for Bears
Failure of an obvious effort to further depress stocks, with Steel common being the special target, featured the first half hour’s trading. Several large blocks of Steel were thrown on the market putting the price down to 104% at which point resistance was met and the stock quickly rebounded a point. Other steel stocks improved over their opening prices.
The Motor
The Railroad Situation
Statement of Warren S. Stone, head of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, before the House Interstate Commerce Committee, that he did not believe a railroad strike would be called even if the Plumb plan for government ownership failed of adoption, served, as a further tonic for the market and U. S. Steel retained a position well above *106. In fact it got above the top price reached in the rally of Tuesday. Mr. Stone said that bin statement was as one speaking largely for the locomotive engineers and said “our action would be to try to create enough sentiment throughout the country to compel Congress to adopt the Plumb plan.”
United Retail Stores at New High
United Retail Stores led the industrial list and made a new record high at 113%, an overnight gain of 5% points. The rights to subscribe to the new candy company shares are 1714 bid on the Curb. No actual dates have been announced by the Retail company on the rights and they* are being traded in on a “when, as and if issued” basis. The Whelan-Duke interests originally underwrote 50,000 shares of the United Retail stock. Since then stockholders of the United Cigar Stores Co. have been offered the privilege of exchanging their stock on the basis of two shares of Retail stock for one share of United Cigar Stores. Inasmuch as the common share capitalization of United Cigar Stores was slightly over $27,000,000, if all the stock was exchanged it would call for something over 540,000 shares of Retail stock. Adding the original underwriting would mean something like 600,000 shares of stock, ital for the new candy which should furnish an operations.
This would mean a paid in capcompany of at least $6,000,000, company’s

Shares Do Well
From the action of dently a short interest iri rally in the motor issues,	_____
Saxon Motors, at 29, touched a new high for the year; while Studebaker, Maxwell common, and Pierce-Arrow were higher. There is no question of the tremendous prosperity being enjoyed by the autoomobile industry, but even this fact could not hold1 up stocks during the heavy* forced liquidation of Monday and early Tuesday.
United Cigar Stores
United Cigar Stores common sold at 200, off 11 points. It is worth mentioning that the rights to exchange Cigar Stores stock on the basis of one for two shares into Retail Stores expired on Monday. Since that time the price of the latter’stock has paid little attention to the former exchange basis.
General Motors, there is evi-the stock. It led a good sized advancing 3% points to 221H.
Floating Supply of Lorillard Small
Lorillard was up 13 points on sales at 240. lowed a 7-point advance on Tuesday and is based on gossip in responsible quarters that the .	.
is now controlled by Tobacco Products with merger possibilities. This would be a logical trade development inasmuch as Lorillard is the largest manufacturer of Turkish cigarettes in the United States while Tobacco Products is in a strong position in the Turkish tobacco leaf market.
Attempts to Uncover Weak Spots Fail
The market continued to act well throughout the first hour and bore out the statement made in this column at the close on Tuesday that the market had been placed in an unusually strong technical position. Of course there were further attempts to uncover weak spots but as far as the general list was concerned the trend was distinctly upward. At the high prices up to 11:15 some of the recoveries over the low of Tuesday included Crucible 8% points, U. S. Rubber 9, United Retail Stores 554, American Woolen 8, U. S. Steel 2%, Union Pacific 2, Studebaker 4%, Texas Co. 7, and General Motors 12. It was only too evident that industrial shares rallied better than tiie railroads.
This fol-evidently company
U. S. Cast Iron Pipe
The activity at rising prices in U. S. Cast Iron Pipe, aside from the advance in price of the company’s products, is said to be based on accumulation by interests conversant with the affairs of the corporation and its outlook. Gossip also has it that interests affiliated with .American Hide & Leather Co. are buying Pipe common on the belief that a merger with Iron Products Corporation is one of the possibilities of the near future. The last named is taking over Centra] Foundry Co. and a consolidation with Cast Iron Pipe is understood to have been tentatively discussed by officials'of both companies.

Rubber Strong
U. S. Rubber became strong early in and before 1:45 got as high as 125%, up S%. reports of an increase in the capitalization but rumor
has it that if such an increase is authorized it will be for the purpose of distributing a stock dividend. Whether or not a stock dividend would be bullish with no dividends being paid on the old stock is problematical. It has been the belief of the Rubber management that when cash dividends are resumed the rate should be a conservative one, probably not over 6%. The company this year should do a business of better than $235,000,000, but the directors will be well satisfied if earnings for 1919 run as high as in 1918 when nearly $31 a share was earned for the $36,000,000 common stock after preferred dividends and taxes-There was talk some time ago that in the event of any further financing U. S. Rubber would sell common stock, possibly at $100 a share. At that time it was officially*, denied that any such plan was under consideration; Talk1 of a stock dividend now might mean rather the distribution of rights for subscription to new stock at considerably below the present market price.
Chicago a Large Seller of Stocks on Tuesday
One prominent New York house on Tuesday sold 35,000 shares of miscellaneous stocks for Chicago interests.
Despite the sharp upturn in the industrial shares thero was a marked disinclination on the part of pools in the low-priced rails to continue operations. The railroad situation is decidedly muddled at the moment and the outlook is hardly conducive to market operations on the long side. At least that seems to be the opinion of those who were bulling this class of stocks up to the end of last week.
All Tire Shares Move in Wake of U. S. Rubber
The whole list became exceedingly strong during tho last half hour with U. S. Steel above 107. Crucible Steel at its top price showed a rally of over 11 points from Tuesday’s low. Cuba Cane Sugar featured the sugar stocks with the common at 32% and the preferred at SO. U. S. Rubber got up to 131% and the move here helped the entire tire division.
