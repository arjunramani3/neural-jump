The long overdue reaction occurred in the stock market in the last hour of business yesterday, and it encountered no such support as had previously been rendered on all recessions. There had been some little warning in an irregular movement of prices early in the day, and although many traders continued to operate on the bull side, they resorted so generally to the use of stop orders, in the hope of limiting possible loss from a sudden decline, that what they intended to be a protextive device became a real element of weakness. The accumulation of the stop orders was so great that it served large operators with a means to catch them and shake stocks out of weak hands. As a pretext for a selling movement Judge Gary’s statement at the United States Steel annual meeting was seized upon, but if there had been nothing of the * * * the decline would probably have occurred at the time, and have been just as sharp as it actually The only feature of Judge Gary’s statement which in any way lend itself to bearish interpretation was

referred to the earnings for the first quarter, and it hardly needed an official announcement to inform the Street that those would be small. In regard to the current quarter Judge Gary expressed the opinion that the results would be favorable, as prices of the company’s product are rising. He advised holders of the common stock to retain their holdings, and expressed the opinion that in finance, industry and commerce this country is Letter today than ever before. A rumor was current at the close of the market that no more important wai orders would be received bv American mills; but the *tory v*as of very doubtful origin, and m any case it is to the prospect of domestic trade, rather than a continuance of European war requirements, "	....... ’
