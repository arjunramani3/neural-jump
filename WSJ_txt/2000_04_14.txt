NEW YORK -- A dreadful performance Friday capped a one-week sell-off that put both the Nasdaq and small-capitalization stocks into bear-market territory.
On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 355.49, or 9.67%, to 3321.29. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks put it the second-worst decline of the major indexes -- at 453.72, it lost 35.50, or 7.26%. The Nasdaq Composite Index stands 34.2% below its March 10 record close, and the Russell 2000 has fallen 25.2% from its March 9 record close. A loss of 20% is generally regarded as a bear market. Many of the stocks that are in the Nasdaq are small stocks, but it is dominated by bigger techs. But the Russell comprises smaller stocks , which indicates that the market sell-off isn't confined to big technology.
The Nasdaq's Friday decline was its largest single-day point loss ever, and its percentage decline was exceeded only by the 11.35% drop of Oct. 19, 1987. The Russell 2000 racked up its largest one-day point loss in history. On a percentage basis, the Russell 2000's decline was its fifth-sharpest ever. For the week, the Nasdaq composite fell 1125.22, or 25.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 89.37, or 16.5%.
Eclipse Surgical Technologies plummeted 1 15/16, or 34%, to 3 13/16. The Sunnyvale, Calif., medical-device company posted a first-quarter loss that was half as deep as its year-earlier operating loss, but which was wider than analysts had been expecting. George K. Baum and John G. Kinnard both lowered their rating on Eclipse to neutral from buy.
MIPS Technologies dropped 10 5/16, or 27%, to 27 3/8 after the Mountain View, Calif., microprocessor designer reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that were below its year-earlier profit and that fell short of analysts' expectations. MIPS said royalties declined 22% from a year earlier, because of lower Nintendo 64 video-gameproduct royalties.
Peerless Systems plunged 29/32, or 25%, to 2 11/16. The El Segundo, Calif., software developer said it expects to post a first-quarter loss of 21 cents to 23 cents a share on revenue of $4.5 million to $5 million, compared with its year-earlier nine-cent profit on $8.2 million of revenue. Peerless said lagging sales and restructuring charges hurt first-quarter earnings.
Amex-traded Dairy Mart Convenience Stores tumbled 11/16, or 24%, to 2 1/8 after the Hudson, Ohio, convenience-store chain said it expects to post losses for the fourth quarter and year ended Jan. 29, and "substantially reduced" results for the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Dairy Mart said lower gasoline profit margins, lower grossprofit margins and continuing increases in expenses, particularly related to store labor, hurt earnings. It said the effects were consistent with overall industry trends.
CellStar, a Carrollton, Texas, wireless-communications products company, fell 19/32, or 9%, to 5 3/4. The company said it is curtailing production at its United Kingdom subsidiary after discovering losses of $3.2 million because of theft and fraud. CellStar said it expects its European revenue to drop while it reviews business practices and that it will take a charge in its second quarter to account for the loss. The company also said scaled-back operations in Europe will reduce revenue in the second quarter, and possibly through the remainder of the year.
J&J Snack Foods fell 1 7/8, or 10%, to 16 1/2 after the Pennsauken, N.J., concern said its fiscal second-quarter earnings will fall short of analysts' expectations. But the company also said it expects "strong sales and profits for the second half" of the year, and that it will meet or exceed analysts' full-year projections.
Horace Mann Educators (NYSE), a Springfield, Ill., insurance company, slid 1 1/4, or 7.3%, to 15 11/16. The company said first-quarter earnings won't meet analysts' projections, largely because of the settlement of an auto-insurance-rate case, as well as lower-than-expected demand from its auto and annuity lines. Horace Mann said it expects its total premium volume in the first quarter to be comparable with the year-earlier quarter.
PlayCore (AMEX) surged 2 3/4, or 41%, to 9 1/2 after the Janesville, Wis., playground-equipment and backyard-products company agreed to be acquired by a newly formed affiliate of Chartwell Investments II for $10.10 a share.
Lexicon Genetics, a Woodlands, Texas, genomics company, climbed 1/2, or 4.4%, to 11 3/4. The company said it was granted a patent covering the use of a protein known as Rad 51 as a novel target for cancer therapeutics.

Idexx Laboratories added 1 7/16, or 6.4%, to 23 11/16. The Westbrook, Maine, concern that sells diagnostic and detection systems for veterinary, dairy and water testing applications, reported a first-quarter profit that exceeded analysts' projections.
Cyber-Care, a Boynton Beach, Fla., health-care technology company, rose 29/64, or 5.7%, to 8 21/64. The company said it completed two equity financings valued at a total of $31 million. Cyber-Care said the financings should provide enough cash to start its plan to make and market the Electronic HouseCall System, an Internet-based healthcare monitoring system.
The Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 indexes fell sharply every day last week, with the Nasdaq composite posting three of its four largest one-day point drops (the other having taken place the prior week). Three of the Russell 2000's largest singleday point declines also came last week.
The weeklong weakness of the Nasdaq and small-cap markets was exacerbated Friday by news of an unexpectedly sharp rise in the March consumer-price index. The CPI, excluding food and energy prices, posted its sharpest rise in five years. The news is seen as all but ensuring that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates further at its May 16 policy meeting.
Technology stocks, large and small, and in a wide range of tech-sector industry groups, bore much of the brunt of Friday's selling pressure, continuing the weeklong trend. On the Nasdaq, 1,295 stocks set 52-week lows, while 21 managed to push to 52-week highs.
On the Nasdaq, declining issues swamped advancers, 3,979 to 535, on volume of 2.45 billion, compared with 1.857 billion Thursday. Nasdaq's Friday volume was the second-highest ever.
