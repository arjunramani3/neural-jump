might have drawn pithy comment from some members of the X. C. C-» although it la in furtherance of the road’s consolidation-plan-
The C. <fe O. paid $11 a share for tbe block of Fere Marquette. At the stock’s low, it showed the C. & O- a loss of about $420,000, but at Wednesday's dose, the C. & O. actually had a profit of a quarter of a point a share In the stock. The big rise in the rail stock market, however, hasn't -yet brought the Erie and^R’ickel Plate' blocks up to «a'price at which C. & O. would have a profit, if it were to exercise its option. Nickel plate is selling around 7 and Erie between 8 and 9, compared with -the option price of $13.25.	.
in the last
A brilliant rally in rail stocks half hour of trading yesterday put new vigor into the stock market, and the list closed with trading heavy and prices near the day's highs. Bonds, which had suffered some moderately sharp set-toacks under profit-taking, rallied in me nnai Hour, many issues recovering most of their losses. The Dow-Jones bond average, however, was off fractionally. Industrial bonds were strong all day, a number reaching new highs on the upswing.
Cotton was the feature of the commodities markets. It was very strong all day, under the stimulus of a weekly weather report adverse to the crop outlook and heavier demand. Tbe close was near the day’s highs, up $2.50 a bale. Wheat was off fractionally. -
Stocks started the day irregular and , drooped during the second hour. Prices for the leaders slipped off, tond only secondary issues were able to advance. During the early afternoon, Telephone sold down to around 113, and there were losses throughout the list. The rail stocks were off a point or more from their earlier highs. The list began to firm up at the beginning of the final hour, and fairly rushed ahead in the last 30 minutes, with volume picking up and the tape lagging. Delaware &. Hud-. son and Delaware..Lackawanna & Western were the leaders of the swift rally. D. & EL, at the close, was up more than 12 points, and D. L. & VV., which closed at 34. was up 10 points, an appreciation of almost 50% during the day. Stocks of other <5oal carriers jumped ahead. Volume for the day reached 3,700.000 shares, against 4,600,000 Tuesday.
There were a few items in the day’s news to whet the speculative appetite. Electric output, in the week ended August 20, recorded a smaller decline from the 1931 week than in the immediately preceding 7-day period. Loadings reports were generally favorable, E. " president of Matheison Alkali, declared that bls company had felt a distinct pickup in business recently, a pickup which also has affected other .chemical companies. C	- -
duced in the latest week*, and .the failures index was down.
Steel operations, for-the week ended Monday, were estimated at around 13%%. slightly below tho&e of the preceding week. From Youngstown, however, came word that the company's mill schedule had been stepped up to 12% of rated capacity, against 8% anticipated at the start of the week.
Too^y, the President’s conference of business leaders gets underway in Washington. It will direct itself largely to plans for bringing about further advances in the commodity price levels.
Prices for securities in both London and Faris were generally firm. In Faris, rentes were off slightly.
Solvents-Moves to Cot Cost of Dividend Payments *
Commercial Solvents is one of the first companies which has moved to cut expenses in paying dividends, by putting payments on a semiannual, instead of a quarterly basis. Certainly, under tbe new schedule of taxes, the cost of paying out a 15-cent quarterly dividend check Is out of all proportion to the amount Exclusive of the labor Involved, the new posts} rates and the tax on checks make the cost of sending ■ cut a dividend on one share of stock just 33% % of the amount of the dividend. Of course, there are very few holders of just one share of a stock selling as low as Commercial Solvents, but even on a 10-share lot, the cost of sending out the dividend is too high in relation to the amount involved.
Solvents is one of the many companies which has seen its list of. small shareholders move up steadily during the long period of depression. The number now is In excess of 27,000. Companies like American Telephone, General Motors and IT. S. Steel, with their shareholders* lists running 'to several hundred thousand, find the quarterly dividend payments, under the new taxes, quite an item.
Central* Pennsylvania	„
leadings Are Better
The railroad optimists got some comfort out of the weekly loadings reports of the New York Central and the Pennsylvania. For tbe week ended August 20, loadings of both roads showed quite a pickup from the preceding week, and the comparison with the corresponding 1931 week was better than previous weeks. The upturn was no more than seasonal, but an indication that the carriers may enjoy a normal betterment in their business, at this time, is a matter for rejoicing.
Incidentally, loadings of Central and Penn-. Sylvania have been the best indices recently as to what the total for the country as a whole will be. If this holds true, the figures to be re* leased Saturday should show traffic gains for tbe country as a whole. The pickup in traffic for some of the roads has been substantial, and has forced the roads to put into active service some of the idle equipment that has been on their hands. The Louisville & Nashville, for instance, recently took out of white lead all the engines in its Cincinnati shops.

Sale of C. & O. Notes Not New Financing;
The Chesapeake & Ohio Railway notes, to be offered shortly, are obligations which the road placed privately when it purchased from the Alleghany Corp. 46.200 shares of Pere Marquette common, and obtained an option to buy 215,000 shares of Erie common and 167,300 shares of Nickel Plate common from the holding company. $3,950,000 in ary 31, 1934. offered soon.
The notes
At that time, the road issued 6% notes, which are due Janu-It is these notes which are to be
are dated February 1, 1932, and are due in just a day short of two years. One reason for making them actually less than two-year obligations is that the Interstate Commerce Commission passes on all rail obligations of two years or more. The Commission previously has approved purchases of Fere Marquette stock by the C. & O. but the acquisition of an option to buy Erie and Nickel Plate stock
