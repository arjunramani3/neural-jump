wy FEATURES OF THE MARKET.
’^Ji.iTra.nsactions dropped below 2,000.000 shares, Sbiity with the conspicuous exception of Northern ^Pacific end some other unimportant cases, the list
•	rshowed -tremendous gains. Twelve stocks gained &__ye than .10 points on the previous close and half ’ Jthei active- list gained more than 2 points. Union tjfPacifie was the great feature, starting the-advance
-leading it to the close. St. Paul, Burlington, ^Consolidated Gas, Lackawanna and Missouri Pacific ,Hiad large gains. In the main, the rise was founded -pon a fallacy. It was believed that a settlement yfof difficulties in the Northwest had been arranged, J-ybut this'was not true. Part of the rise was caused y by: the.covering of shorts and part by the heavy in-“y-zvestanent demand -which came in at the low prices. ’■'.The absence of failures, the ease in money and the t -probabilities of a Northwestern settlement in due /’.lime exerted a favorable influence. Some anxiety iy.-was felt in regard to the London settlement. Chi' cago was a large ifcuyer, Boston bought the copper ' stocks heavily, London did comparatively little.

The great interests in Northern Pacific carried out the agreement to settle at 150. A few outsiders demanded their pound of flesh.

Both parties were confident last night that they controlled Northern Pacific by the ownership of actual stock.
