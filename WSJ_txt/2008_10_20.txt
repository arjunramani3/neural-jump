The rally was helped by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that he would support a second round of fiscal stimulus for the economy and by strong gains in the energy sector, which benefited from a rise in oil prices.

Signs that frozen credit markets may be starting to thaw sent stocks higher.
Stocks started to move up in the morning and never looked back. After a late-day surge, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished ahead 413.21 points, or 4.67%, at 9265.43, just below its intraday high.
It was the fourth-largest percentage gain this year and the fifth- largest in points. Still, the Dow is down just over 30% in 2008.
The rally was helped by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that he would support a second round of fiscal stimulus for the economy and by strong gains in the energy sector, which benefited from a rise in oil prices.
Chevron jumped 11.6% and Exxon Mobil was up 10.2%.
Crude-oil futures rose 3.3% in New York, to $74.25 a barrel, on speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut production at a meeting Friday. Oil has fallen 49% from its record high on July 3.
All 30 stocks in the Dow rose. Some of its financial components lagged behind others' gains. J.P. Morgan Chase finished up 3.4% and Citigroup rose 1.4%, though Bank of America rose 5%.
"The credit-market easing we've seen today is the most bullish thing I've seen in weeks and weeks," said Jerome J. Heppelmann, portfolio manager at asset-management firm Liberty Ridge Capital in Berwyn, Pa. "But we still have a lot of deleveraging to do," the unwinding of risky bets by financial firms using borrowed money. "That process could take months."
The Vix, a gauge of investor jitters measured by options trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, fell nearly 25% after reaching records last week.
"I'm not convinced that we're out of the negative cycle" in the stock market, said Roger Volz, a trader at Hampton Securities, a New York brokerage. "But the worst of the violence of the moves to the downside has probably passed."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.8% to 985.40, with gains made in all its sectors.
