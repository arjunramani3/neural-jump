After bouncing up and down throughout the day, stocks finished with a second consecutive day of gains as a surge in mortgage applications boosted banks and home builders.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 172.60 points, or 2.1%, to 8591.69, after trading in a 400-point range during the day. It was the seventh time in eight trading days that the blue chips finished with gains, a nearly 14% rise since their 5 1/2-year low on Nov. 20.
Citigroup rose 8.3% Wednesday. Bank of America was up nearly 7%.
The Mortgage Bankers Association reported refinancing applications more than doubled last week from the week before while applications to buy a home rose 38%.
Other economic news was grim. The Federal Reserve released its "beige book" of economic indicators, which showed activity in all the central bank's districts had weakened over the past month. The Institute of Supply Management reported a sharp decline in service-sector activity in November.
Stock traders said the day's moves were mostly driven by bets for fast profits that could be quickly unwound, especially if November jobs data due from the government Friday are as dismal as some forecasters are expecting.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished up 2.6%, at 870.74, led by a 4.3% gain in its financial sector. It was also the S&P's seventh gain in eight trading days.
In a sign investors are still nervous, Treasury prices continued to rise, sending yields lower. The yield on the two-year note fell to 0.893%, the lowest in more than 35 years. Credit: By Peter A. McKay
