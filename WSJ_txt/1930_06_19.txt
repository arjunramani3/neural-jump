Downward tendencies in the main body of stocks were checked yesterday and the Raders scored substantial rallies lrom their recent lows Wednesday’s further bad breaks brought industrials used in the IDow-Jones averages down to 218 84, compared Vkith a high of 294 07 at the peak of the spring rise on April 17.
This drastic readjustment of prices. and particularly the rapid pace set by the decline ol the last few days, suggested that bearish operations were being carried to excess. At the same Time, a saner view spread witn regard to Dullness prospects, and buying by important interests started a gradual upturn in stocks recently under severe pressure.
Expressions by leading bankers that there was nothing hidden in the present situation reassured the bull forces, and induced active covering by the extensive short account n the principal trading stocks. Estimates x\ere made that the weekly brokers’ loans statement, cue after Thursday s close, would show a sweep.ng reduction, and th*s outlook gave impetus to the improvement in the general list.

which activities on the downside hart converged, furnished impressive leadership for the rally. With a top-heavy short interest outstanding in the stock. Steel gradually worked upward, stimulating a broadening of the recovery throughout the list. General Electric, Gan. Union Carbide, and other members of the Principal industrial class also pushM persistently upward, and sharp rebounds occurred in various specialties, including Worthington Pump, J. X. Case, and Vanadium.
Buying by traders playing for a rally was based largely on the belief that technical conditions in the market had been greatly strengthened after the last three days of distress selling. Volume in these three sessions was 5,600,-OOO shares Monday, 5.000,000 Tuesday, and 6,400,000 shares Wednesday. While these totals were substantially below the turnover during the culminating phase of the October-November collapse, with brokers’ loans under $4,000,000,000 ■they were equivalent as regards liquidation of margin accounts to much heavier trading days with collateral borrowings at the high levels of last~ autumn.
In addition to the buying activities of speculative interests, accumulation went ahead for the account of people feeling that existing market conditions afforded a good opportunity to make long-pull commitments. In view of the piling up of wealth in. this country since the prewar days, and the steady gams in corporate assets, it was considered illogical to expect a return, to anything like the stock levels prevailing at the outbreak of the European conflict.
Many investors were picking up standard stocks whose dividends appear well fortified and were available at yields above current rates for money. It was argued that those who were selling stocks now would probably prove to be as wrong as those who were buyers last summer. This contention was based on the fact that the present movement is almost the revcise of what happened m the first nine months of 1929. Then stocks were irregular for six months, following which a wide advance took place m stock prices in face of business recession. In the last few weeks, severe declines have occurred after a slump of 12 months in general trade, and nt a time when a turn for the better should not be far away.
A study of the increase in the total market value of all stocks listed on the Stock Exchange, as compared with the increase in number of issues and shares listed, reveals interesting relationships.
From January, 1925, tn September. 1929, total value of listed securities rose from 327,000,000.000 to 3S9.000.000.000. and dropped on December 1 to $63,000,000,000. at which figure values approximately stand today.
Therefore, m the course of the last four years the value of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange has increased over 100%. However, the number of issues in the meantime has increased from 927 issues to 1,324 issues, or approximately 50%, while the number of shares listed has increased from 433.000,000 to 1,220,000.000, or 300%.
Granted that the companies which have been listed m the interim are not all of comparable importance with the companies already on the New York Stock Exchange, it must be borne in mind that in the past four years, the reinvested earnings of the largest companies must be a factor of relative importance. During that period. U. S. Steel and Genera! Motors alone have reinvested nearly $600,000,000 in undistributed earnings, or approximately 1% of the present total value of securities listed.
It must also be borne in mind that stock rights in other issues have brought m money that has increased the total assets behind these securities. Also the transition of V. S. from a debtor to a creditor nation has been reflected marketwise during this interim, in which also widespread ownership of stocks and the appearance of investment trusts and the concentration of prosperity on these leading companies, have been outstanding developments. On the basis it is argued that a large fraction of th’e 100% increase in values is still inherent in the Stock Exchange securities and probably represents value that is much greater in comparison to values of 1921 than is generally supposed in present gloom.

brings about a decline of prices at one time arc never repeated in identical form,” says Erazier Jelke & Co. “But in price movements there ha«s been a marked parallel between tae bear market of 1929-30 and the bear market of 192021. The lows of 1920 were made on December 21. whereas the low’s of 1929 were made on November 13 and December 20.
“The spring rally of 1921 culminated on May 5, whereas the spring rally of 1930 reached its peak on April 17. The June reaction of 1921 made a low’ of 64.90 in the Dow-Jones industrial average on June 20, compared with a low of 66.75 on December 21, 1920. The bear market of 1921 finally culminated on August 24, 1921, when the Dow-Jones industrial average stood at 63.90. It is interesting to note that rallies dur-the summer of 1921 were dull affairs, and that the highest point reached by the average in the 1921 summer rally was 69.05. Incidentally total sales in June, 1921, were 18,170,000 shares, compared with 10,990,000 shares in August.”
felt that this week’s statement would again show that the Bank had been indulging in open market operations to tighten the money market. The statement, however, offers no evidence of such action. Holdings of government securities actually advanced £165,000 to £46,475,000 while “other” securities, which include discounts and advances together with securities other than government, increased £2,991,000. Thus the market received from these two sources a total of £3,156,000 of new funds during the week.
This is particularly interesting in view of the fact that the rates continued, to stiffen when certain factors, such as the above plus higher gold reserves, would give promise of some easing. Explanation is probably to be found in flow of short term credits to Germany which has forced the bill rates in Berlin down far out of line with the Reichsbank rate and which has revived discussion of a possible reduction in the German bank rate in the near future. Germany now has a plethora of short funds but long
Bank of England’s statement this week reveals little important change. Circulation was off £4,755,000 on the week to £359,247,000. This compares with a decline in corresponding week of last year of £2,155,000. Reserves were up £5,064,000 to £58,242,000, compared with £63,197.000 on June 20, 1929. Reserve ratio, however, advanced but 0.7% to 52.6%„due largely to gr* increase in public deposits to £16,577,000 from. £8,238,000. This is a seasonal factor. .East year during the corresponding week public deposits advanced to £21,263,000 from £10,580,000. Private deposits were off £187,000, while in same week last year an increase of £5,518,000 was recorded. Bullion holdings increased £309,000 to £157,489,000. Present figure compares with £163,500,000 a year ago.
It will be recalled that a week ago the Bank sold government securities to amount of £12.070,000 which had a marked effect in stiffening th* London bill rates. These rates have contin-wed to advance in the past week and it has been ( maturities are still scarce and high.
