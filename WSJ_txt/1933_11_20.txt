The Reconstruction Finance Corp, injected renewed enthusiasm for the rise in the stock market at the start of the new week, with a mark-up of 10 cents in the price for newly mined domestic gold. Following five successive days in which the price was held unchanged at $33.56 an ounce, the increase set in motion a series of impulses which were felt in all the speculative markets—in foreign exchange, the commodities and on the New York Stock Exchange where one of the broadest upturns in many sessions took place. Even the railroad stocks, which of late have been inclined to lag behind the recovery in industrials, participated in the uprush.
while the rise in the gold price encouraged speculative activities tending to depreciate the dollar* and buoy commodity prices, there were other forces behind the rise in stocks, chiefly the growing evidence that business throughout the country is improving. This brought widespread buying into the retail stores, motors, chemicals and other industries which thus far have manifested the greatest improvement. Declaration of an extra dividend of 75 cents on the common stock of du Pont, in addition to the regular quarterly dividend of 50 cents, helped to emphasize the tangible character of the improvement in earnings already recorded
Sterling showed an advance of about 8 cents, and the franc was up about 4 points at the peak of the move against the dollar. In the afternoon the dollar rallied a little and recovered part of the earlier losses
Foreign government bonds again moved higher, while United States Treasury issues sold cf to a new low level on the current move. The French government and municipal issues, Irish Free State 5s, Switzerland 5J>s and British 4s pushed to new high levels after their sharp rise of the previous week. Domestic bonds were irregular. with the speculative issues generally showed a firmer trend.
In the commodity markets the grains led the upturn. Wheat closed with advances of from 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel. Cotton late in the afternoon was about 7 points higher on the day.
Recovery Drive Bringing Results
The full impetus of the Administration’s recovery' efforts should be felt within the next 60 to 90 days. Already, retail and automobile sales figures indicate conclusively that the rural areas are commencing to increase buying. The Administration’s plan to put 2,000.000 men to work immediately and another 2.000.000 by December 15 may help the purchasing power of the larger cities. Through the cooperation of states and municipalities, it is estimated that about S48.000.000 a week will be added to payrolls directly through the employment of these men.
Capital Goods Demand Improves Slightly
Despite widespread uncertainty in financial centers and the so-called inability to obtain financing of a long-term nature, there is sonic evidence that the capital goods industries are beginning to feel some stirring of life after the lull of the past two years Structural steel buying and railroad inquiries for rails and other equipment arc better than in some time. It is true that in both cases government financing is largely responsible for the release of this work. But there are also a few signs that private initiative is again up and coming. For instance, over the week-end it was reported that there was a substantial pick-up in building contracts in greater New York. An analysis of the figures showed that in addition to considerable repair work, a few small apartment houses were about to be built. This would seem to indicate that, although there may be a large surplus of apartment houses in this territory, much of it is now obsolete.
Continental Can Depression-Proof
Without attracting much attention. Continental Can has been pushing forward to successive new high's for the current year. The stock started this week with a new 1933 top above 71. This issue has never been a particular favorite for professional traders or group operators, yet its progress over a period has been remarkable. The investor who held Continental Can through the difficult times of the past few years has little to regret at the moment. The high for 1929 was 92 and the low for that > ear was 4014. Despite the issuance ol additional capital shares shortly after 1929 tc finance the purchase of small can manufacturing properties, there apparently has been no dilution of earning power such as occurred when many other large companies made acquisitions on the basis of 1929 and 1930 market conditions. The wrorking capital position of the company is stronger than ever and the current dividend ol $2.50 annually is the same as paid in 1929. The current dividend, moreover, is being earned by a comfortable margin.
Technical Position of Market Strong
In the event that stiffer margin requirement? on stock trading are decided on. as some now anticipate, it should cause relatively little disturbance to immediate market movements. The decline in brokers’ loans during the past month, amounting to about $108,000,000. is a reflection of the cautious attitude of the average trader today. The drop in loans amounts to about 12l,2% since October 18.
