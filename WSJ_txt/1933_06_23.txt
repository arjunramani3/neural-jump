High and Low. Prices
Additions yesterday 3 8 17 2 1
Friday, on the New York Stock Exchange, 22 stocks made' new highs and no stock made a new low, for the year 1933.
Further selling, the normal result of a setback of the type suffered in the late trading Thursday, was absorbed in good style during the morning trading, and the list rallied in the late dealings yesterday, with the agricultural imPlament shares and the motor stocks in the van of the recovery. Strength In J. I Case and International Harvester reflected the new upturn in wheat, which was marked up sharply in the late dealings. At the close, wheat was at the highest price since Mav. 1931. Trading in stocks was dull in the late morning, falling to the lowest levels in a long time. Advances in the leaders ran to as much as 6% points.
The securities markets paid little attention to the fluctuations in currencies. - While francs were weak, and French bonds were heavy, official denial that France contemplated abandoning the gold standard allayed some of the tears which had brought out the hevy selling late on Thursday. Sterling was strong early, but cased off later, and was about unchanged on the day.
Prices for bonds were mixed. High-grade railroad and utility issues were a shade higher, while the industrial and junior railroad obligations, the star performers recently, eased off. Governments were lower.
Grains closed at the day’s hlgrhs, running' up swiftly. Wheat finished at new hiyhs, up 1% to 2^4 cents a bushel. Corn, oats and rye advanced also. The upturn m wheat was due. in part, to progress made at the economic conference on a program of world crop curtailment. Cotton was easier early, but recovered late in the day and closed up almost 51 a bale.
Wheat and Farm Purchasing Power
“While this year’s winter wheat crop is estimated at about 30% under the 1932 outturn, the rise in prices for wheat which has taken place indicates that the return to the farmer for this year’s production will show some improvement from the amount received for his crop last year. September wheat currently is selling: in Chicago for roughly 80 cents a bushel, compared with around 50 cents a bushel at the like time last year. Farmers have had an increase in price corresponding to the upturn in the Chicago market, and it has offset the fall in the size of the crop.
One big factor in gauging farm income from wheat is the carryover of last year’s grain On April 1, grain on the farms was put at 178,354,000 bushels, a considerably larger total than at the like time a year previous. Much of that grraln has come to the markets since April 1, and the farmer got good prices for it. Much more is yet to come, and the farmer will get the full benefit of the current relatively high prices.

Utility Dividend Reductions
Reductions in dividends voted by directors of Commonwealth Edison and Public Service of Northern Illinois had been foreshadowed in testimony presented to the Illinois Commerce Commission in the rate action, recently concluded. Nevertheless, the dividend reductions, made by these two important operating companies have depressed the entire utility group. They demonstrated, once more, how quickly adverse action by rate-making bodies is translated into cuts in returns to stockholders.
The new rates, suggested by the three operating companies in the Chicago area, are not to be put into effect until July 1. They constitute a 3% reduction from existing ratees, and mean an annual loss in revenues of $4,549,000 to the three operating companies, according to their estimates. The commission sought much larger reductions, and the new rates which are being put into effect are only temporary. '
The new dividend rate for Commonwealth Edison brings payments down to $4 a year, just 50% of the level prevailing before troubles beset the company as result of the Insull management. Fublic Service of Northern Illinois' dividend rate is now only 25% of the old annual payment.
Taxes on Corporate Dividends
Corporations are now going to some pains to point out to stockholders that they are being called on to deduct at the source of payment the new dividend tax of 5%. Under regulations promulgated, -the tax must be deducted on all dividends declared after 11:55 the morning of June 16. Yesterday, the Texon Oil & Land Co., in making a payment of 15 cents a share, pointed out that it was standing the tax, and stockholders receiving dividends didn’t need to worry about it.
The Brokers’ Loans Figure®
While brokers' loans showed a small decline last week, the total for the week ended June 21 was $775,000,000, and for the first time since the expansion began brokers' loans were more than double the level for the corresponding period of the previous year. The latest figure compares with $359,000,000 for the similar week a year previous, an increase of 113% in loans. On the basis of the Dow-Jones industrial average, the price level for Industrial stocks is up just about 100% from the similar date a year ago, while the rail average is more than double the figure prevailing a year ago.
Market at Highs Again
Yesterday’s sharp recovery in prices, most of which took place in the final hour of trading, carried the Dow-Jones industrial and railroad averages back up to the highs of the recent trading range. At the close, the industrial average was 1.22 points under the June 12 high, with the rail average once more above the June 12 top of 44.43. On June 19, the rail average pushed half a point above the June 12 top, but the industrial averagePat the close, ruled under the June 12 figure.
Trading volume yesterday died away after stocks had been subjected to pressure In the morning, and picked up again on the advance in the late dealings.
