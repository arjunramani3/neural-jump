Byron Wien, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, turned optimistic this summer, after predicting at the beginning of the year that the stock market would finish lower for the third straight year. Mr. Wien, a well-known market hand who was criticized for his warnings in the late 1990s that the market was dangerously overvalued, now says the bear market is over.
Mr. Wien says the stock market is dramatically undervalued, given low interest rates. He says investor sentiment is too negative amid improving earnings and what appears to be a healthy economy. He says the S&P 500 will finish the year down only 10% to 15% -- which, given it is off 26% now, would be a feat -- and that the market will rise 10% next year.

Corrections & Amplifications
MORGAN STANLEY'S Byron Wien expects the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to finish the year down about 10% to 15%. An article on Monday's Money & Investing page mistakenly said that Mr. Wien expected the S&P 500 to fall 10% to 15% from its Friday level.
(WSJ Oct. 2, 2002)
ARE STOCKS bottoming out or caving in?
After another brutal round of selling last week, optimists weren't easy to find on Wall Street. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.7%, or 295.67 points, to 7701.45. The index slipped 3.6% for the week.
The broader market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, was down 2.1% last week, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was off 1.8%.
Investors fretted about many of the issues that have troubled the market for weeks. Earnings warnings from Philip Morris and Wyeth sent those stocks lower, while corporate-governance concerns -- including talk of a Citigroup settlement with regulators over stock-research activities -- also hurt stocks .
Philip Morris was "one of the areas investors were hiding," says Jeffrey Tabak, managing director at brokerage firm Miller Tabak, because investors think demand for cigarettes should be steady in good times and bad.
International instability came into play Friday, as woes in Brazil and Argentina hurt the shares of large American financial institutions such as Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, which lend to the region.
Yet, the view that the market is in for an inexorable fall isn't universal. A large stable of bullish analysts point out that earnings, despite high-profile warnings, are improving and that the economy is doing better after a swoon during the summer.

Then there is Brett Gallagher, head of U.S. equities at Julius Baer Investment Management in New York, which has about $3.9 billion in assets under management.
An unapologetic bear, he says earnings are still overstated and that investors can't trust the numbers being pumped out by American companies. Given that, he thinks the market has a lot further to fall. He expects the S&P 500 to fall to between 550 and 650 points during the next several years.
Last week, The Wall Street Journal sat down with the analysts in separate interviews and asked each to make his case.
