$158,922 in the previous fiscal year. General Mills, at one time, found it necessary to incur substantial bank loans to carry on its business, but the steady improvement in its balance sheet position has made bank borrowings play a smaller part in its business.	.
An aggressive sales campaign, to further the sales of its branded products, was one factor which enabled General Mills to report increased earnings in the .past fiscal year over the two previous years. Net income moved up to $4,081,855, equal to $4.12 a share on 662,454 no-par shares of common stock, excluding 12,642 shares in the company’s treasury. .Net in the previous fiscal period was $3,891,200. General Mills common, at around 60, is selling for approximately 14 times, per share net income for the last fiscal year, and yields 5% on the $3 annual dividend.'
Stock Break and Staple Prices
The severity of the reaction in stock prices is raising all Kinds of questions as to what effect it will have on the course of business and on prices generally. As far as prices for staples and finished goods is concerned, the position of the government is going to be the controlling factor, and there is no indication of any let-up in the Administration’s program to hold prices at what it regards reasonable levels. That was demonstrated in the drastic action limiting price fluctuations in grain futures.
The codes being adopted under the provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act, and the blanket voluntary code promulgated by the Administration, are major items which should support retail prices. Industries cannot pay the higher wages provided under those codes without some increase in prices. For the time being, at least, retail prices should be held up, although not at the levels which they might have reached had the staples markets not reacted so swiftly.
The point at which the break in stocks will be felt most keenly, in all probability, is in public buying. A slump in stock prices to the extent experienced in the four days ended Saturday has a psychological effect which cannot be ignored, in addition to the actual losses which have been suffered in the market. Even before the setback In the market, concern was felt in conservative quarters as to how the public would react to higher retail prices in the fall.
AU Groups Shared Decline
Before the break in stock prices, the insistent buying came into the utility stocks, in spite ___________________________ of the high prices prevailing, on the theory that In the foreign bond market, the group had not shared fully in the forward ' movement, and therefore would not react to any such extent as would other groups. A study of the extent of the four-day decline in stocks completely disproves that argument.
The Dow-Jones utility average Saturday was off 21.6% from the high on the recovery. The

the week-
The breathing spell provided end and the abbreviation of the trading, session to three hours served to calm the nervousness in the financial community and brought about a distinct betterment in the tone of all the markets. In stocks, the recovery was general, with the list opening higher and holding good gains in an active market. Trading favorites were up 2 to 8 points, and only one or two stocks continued to show the effects of the drastic decline’in shares ana grains on overextended positions. Case was a soft spot, with special selling in the issue linked to the suspension of a house from the Chicago Board of Trade.
In the first hour, between noon and 1 o’clock, trading ran to 1,220,000 shares, but later the market quieted down a little. It picked up in the last part of the session, when prices were advancing, and volume for the short session was 3,420,000 shares.
Stocks had the benefit of the improved commodities markets and several items on domestic business which were reassuring. While the steel'reviews, pointed out that new buying was slackening, operations held at 55% of capacity. Several carrier reports for June attested to the marked betterment in earnings railroads enjoyed in that month. Chesapeake & Ohio loadings for the July 22 week, however, showed . smaller percentage gain over the similar week of 1032 than heretofore.
Selling pressure, which had brought sharp declines in speculative railroad bonds, was lifted and there were abrupt rallies in the group. The whole domestic corporation bond list had an improved tone. j_	"
acute weakness in Argentine Issues was the feature. European bonds held steady. The foreign exchange market was quieter, with the pound reacting after an early rise.
Grains closed with changes small. Three out of the four deliveries of wheat futures finished___________ _
at Thursday’s closing prices, the bottom fixed raij average was off 21.5%, while the industrial by the government. The September delivery average, which had the biggest percentage ad-closed up 1 cent, and corn, oats and rye were vance, was off only 18.6%. On a percentage irregularly higher. The best performers in the basis, the utilities were off more than any other commodities markets were cotton, which moved	......	...
up $2 a bale, and rubber, which added more than 1 cent a pound to ita value, in an active market.
Foreign markets were lower. In Paris, only rentes moved against the trend. In London, the whole list was irregularly easier.
General Mills Builds Up Inventories
The management of General Mills was'quick to see the way the wind was blowing, the company’s report reveals, and stocked up on inventory in the past fiscal year, raising cash for grain purchases by disposing of .the Treasury certificates the company held at the end of the previous fiscal year. Inventories stood at $20,310,415 May 31, up 58% from the close of the previous fiscal year. The heavy stocking-up program didn't impair General Mills’ fiscal position. Current assets, at the year-end, were $32,779,027, compared with current liabilities of $5,407,428, while a year previous current assets were $29,433,300, against current liabilities of $4,377,219.
Two items in the company's income account were noteworthy. Depreciation of^ $1,005,702 was a little larger than in the previous year. Interest paid was down to $92,672, compared with
by
group, instead of holding up better.	•
Announcement on Rubber Coming
Rubber stocks were among the strong spots on the board yesterday, and crude rubber staged a dynamic upswing in the New York market The rapid upswing was due, in part, to the announcement from Amsterdam that some announcement in regard to restriction of rubber production would be made at the International Rubber Association meeting Thursday.
Du Pont Profits on Support Stock
Du Pont must be added to the list of companies which has profited from the sale of some of the support stock purchased during distressed markets of 1932. The company's report for the first half year included an item of $4,023,149 added to surplus and showed that the company's holdings of its own stock, which totaled 193,785 shares at the end of 1932, had been reduced to 17.441 at the end of the first half of 1933.

particularly good, in view of the fact that du Pont received income from its investment in General Motors common equal to only 46 cents a share on du Pont common, compared with income equal to 69 cents a share from this source in the similar half of 1932. Despite this reduction, du Pont had net of $1.03 a share in the first half, against $1.01 in the similar half of 1932.
Retracing Lost Ground
