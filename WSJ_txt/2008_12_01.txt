The stock market had one of its worst days ever, wiping out a big chunk of one of its biggest short-term rallies and showing the impact of its recent wild swings.
The selloff, on many investors' first day back from the Thanksgiving holiday, spurred concerns that the rally of the five previous trading days might have been a temporary bounce rather than the start of a lasting recovery.
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 679.95 points, or 7.7%, to 8149.09. It was the 12th-biggest one-day percentage drop and the fourth-sharpest point drop since the Dow was launched in 1896.
Over the previous five sessions, the Dow had been up 1277 points, or 17%, its biggest five-day percentage gain since 1933. The selling erased more than half of the five-day gain.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had been up 19% over those five sessions, also the most since 1933. The S&P 500 dropped 8.9% Monday, or 80.03 points, to 816.21. The selling began amid fears that gains during the holiday week weren't sustainable.
Another onslaught of negative economic news contributed to the declines.
The National Bureau of Economic Research declared that a recession began in December of last year. That makes the recession nearly one year old, and because it appears to be worsening, investors concluded that it is likely to be deeper than the average recession, which lasts less than a year.
"The real question is, how bad is this recession? We know it is not mild. Is it severe or is it a Great Depression-type event?" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at brokerage firm LPL Financial in Boston.
As the day began, investors learned that an index of manufacturing activity slipped to a 26-year low in November, and that October construction activity was worse than expected.
Some people sold over fears that this Friday's release of the Labor Department's November employment data could bring more bad news.
Some also were concerned because commercial-credit markets didn't rally over the previous five-day period the way stocks did.
Worries about credit markets contributed to a decline in financial stocks, which had been up over the previous five days.
Citigroup fell 22%, Bank of America declined 21% and J.P. Morgan Chase slipped 18%. A Dow Jones index of U.S. bank stocks fell 18%, its worst one-day percentage decline since it was created in 1991.
Those declines came despite comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that further interest-rate cuts are "certainly feasible," and that the Fed is contemplating buying longer-term Treasury bonds, which would push Treasury prices higher and yields lower. The goal would be to try to force market interest rates lower and to pump money into the economy, hoping to stimulate economic activity.
For the moment, the result was to stimulate more buying of longer-term Treasury bonds, to which investors already had been fleeing. The yield of the 10-year Treasury note, already at its lowest level in more than 31 years, fell to 2.719%.
Once again, a big part of the day's stock selling came in the last hour, during which the Dow fell 257 points. Some investors believe that late-day declines in recent weeks partly reflect forced selling.
The Russell 2000 index of small stocks declined 12% and the Standard & Poor's 600-stock index of midsize shares fell 11%.
Biggest Point Drops Monday's slide was the Dow Jones Industrial Average's fourth-largest point decline, though only 12th-worst in percentage terms. Date Close Pt.
