Liquidation in Smelters
With a decline of 2% points, Southern Pacific be
I bearish in their views, but some of the most observant i traders on the floor said the buying was better than the I selling.
I An unfavorable feature was that the market was act-I ive only on down turns. When it rallied, to ever so small an extent, it became very dull, whereas when it began to. go down the activity generally became pronounced.	I
Of course every stock that went to a new low level1 weakened some margin or discouraged some small specu-i lator. and there was, naturally, under such circumstances, a fair amount of scattered liquidation.
Union Pacific was quite active and fell to a new low for the downward movement, and Reading also was under
rather heavy pressure.
There was a belter demand for time money on the part of some of the large commission houses, which had seen the warning regard:ng money in Saturday’s bank statement, and decided to make preparations for the upward movement in the price of stocks which they thought would come before very long.
Foreign selling of storks to t>he amount about 30,00., shares was the heaviest for a considerable time past and was something of a factor in causing the decline. The selling was the heaviest in Steel. Copper and the Harriman issues.
New low records.
The market’s tone was still uncertain in the early afternoon, but the trading was dull by contrast with the activity of the first hour and the liquidation appeared t > be coming almost entirely from the small fry. Some good traders contended that an effort was made to make the market look as weak as possible, but of course they may have been mistaken in their impression.
American Smelting i- Refining was a particularly weak feature, and this stock has probably proved a more expensive speculation to the few bulls on the floor than :.n other. It r.as been bought on the declines by a number of traders, but in nearly ev-_ ry case these have been put out with a loss.
Reading was weaker arour.d one o’clock than it had been at any other stage of the session, but the buying on the decline was said to be good. Since the beginning o. the break Reading has acted as really wanted the stock.

as if the very existence of business was jeopardized by it. The bill was printed in the newspapers weeks ago, and if the Street did not familiarize itself with its provisions
