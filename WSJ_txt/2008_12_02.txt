Stocks rebounded a bit from Monday's steep declines, spurred by a rally in beaten-down financial stocks and late-day gains by auto makers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell nearly 680 points Monday, jumped 270.00 points Tuesday, ending 3.3% higher, at 8419.09. Bank of America and Citigroup both rose nearly 12%.
Stocks traded in the black all day, rising steadily in the morning, falling back in the early afternoon, and hitting their high for the day just before the close.
General Electric jumped nearly 14% after saying it would shrink its financial unit, GE Capital, and maintain its dividend in 2009.
"You have companies right now reaching a point where their shares really can't go any lower," said Neil Hennessy, president of Hennessy Funds in Novato, Calif. "It's probably going to take awhile longer, with a lot of late-day volatility, before that message really sinks in."
There are potential pitfalls. Jobs data due later in the week are expected to show further signs of weakness. Concerns about demand for energy in a slumping economy sent oil futures down 4.7% in New York, to $46.96 a barrel.
Goldman Sachs Group slipped 1.2% after The Wall Street Journal reported that its loss for the quarter just ended would be much deeper than analysts were expecting.
Major auto makers posted dismal November sales as they renewed their push for a congressional bailout with new turnaround plans. General Motors shares ended with a 5.7% gain even after it asked for a bigger bailout than it said it needed just two weeks ago. Ford rose 5.9%.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index, which also fell sharply Monday, rose 4% to 848.81. All its sectors posted gains, led by a 9% jump in financials.
Activity in the investment-grade bond market picked up, as Consolidated Edison, Caterpillar and Hewlett-Packard all sold new debt. Meanwhile, investors continued to flock to the safety of long-term Treasury bonds, sending yields lower. The yield on the 30-year bond slipped to 3.197%.
