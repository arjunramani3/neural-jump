stantial credit balances, or who had sizable bank balances, decided that cash was more expensive to hold than securities or commodities. That brought a flow of buying orders on the early irregularity. The ability of the market to absorb selling, in the face of the unprecedented increase in circulation. Induced short covering. Shorts found a scarcity of stock, and had to bid the market up to cover their commitments.
Opposing Holidays
The opposition of the Northwest Bancorp, to the Wisconsin banking holiday declared by Governor Schmedeman aroused a great deal of comment. The corporation, which is a group banking organization operating banks in Wisconsin, among other states, kept the institutions it controls in that state open, in. the face of the Governor’s mandatory order, awaiting assurance of the Governor’s power to enforce the order.
Tn several states bank holidays have caused a good deal of discomfort to bankers whose institutions were entirely sound. Naturally, they have wished to keep their banks open, not only because of the public service they would render in so doing but also because of the standing it would give them in their communities. The Northwest Bancorp.’s move is the first in the direction of giving a thorough test to the powers of the Governor of a state in ordering a complete shutdown.
Stoclcs and commodities staged an, outburst of fireworks yesterday, rallying strongly after opening hesitancy. Bonds failed to move upward; all high grade obligations sagged lower most of the day. All the markets were nervous.
The upward surge in stocks came with dramatic swiftness, and nervous shorts were largely responsible for it. The major item of the overnight news was the Federal Reserve statement, and the most arresting matter in it was the $732,000,000 increase in money in circulation.
Stocks opened mixed, and for half an hour did little. Trading was only 150,000 shares in the first 30 minutes. Nervousness among the shorts was increased by a flood of rumors in Wall Street and the performance of the market in the face of the bad news. Some covering took place, and then there was a general rush to close out short commitments. Stocks fairly bounded ahead, with trading from 10:30 to noon reaching 700,000 shares. In some cases, stocks rushed up about 6 points from their early lows. Telephone and J. I. Case were among the swift movers. In the afternoon the list eased off from the highs, but prices were up at the close. Gains ran to as much as 3 points.

Wheat Up 2'/2 Cents for a While
Wheat and cotton led the uprush in commodities. At the day's highs wheat was up 2’-i cents a bushel, and at the close it Was up around 2 cents. Com, too, rallied strongly. Cotton linished up more than $1 a bale, compared with highs of 81.25. Silver and rubber were among other commodities showing outstanding strength.
Bonds slid generally lower, even the more speculative issues suffering. High grade bonds were heavy, and government obligations were irregular. There was much trading in governments throughout the day. Foreign bonds were higher. German issues rallying in both New York and London.
Interest remained centered on the banking news, and It was not very palatable. Wall Street continued to look to Washington in tile hope of some action. The new national administration goes into office today, and many vital matters arc expected to come up for action within the next week or two. The possibility that there might be dramatic news from this quarter soon led to some buying of stocks.
The dollar continued weak in the foreign exchange market, hut conditions showed no important change. Prices on the Paris Bourse were irregular, and in London the market was mixed.
Bright Spots
Bank depositors got a lift yesterday when interest rates on deposits were moved up. The increase m the rates was only logical, in view of the generally tight money situation The further rise in call money, which went to I'< in the afternoon, was a boon to those who have cash to lend in the call market and who up to two days ago were getting only 1% on their funds.
Business was booming in bank vaults One savings bank official, finding a rushing business m safety deposit boxes in the vault of his bank, took the opportunity to double the price.
Armco Reduces Loss
With sales down 32% from 1931, American Rolling Mill last year cut its loss roughly 30% For a steel company such a showing is remarkable, for the steel industry has had a difficult time cutting costs to a degree commensurate with the reduced demand
Two Items in the Rolling Mill statement showed wide variation from 1931 The income account showed depreciation at $1,723,291. against 84.9S9.113 for 1931. Actual depreciation in 1932 was roughly $306,000 higher than in 193t. In the latter year, sizable expenditures for maintenance and repair costs, lumped under the heading of depreciation, swelled that figure. In 1932. minor expenditures for maintenance and repairs were absorbed in operating expenses.
Other income showed a big jump, due to the inclusion of excess face value over cost of bonds retired under a policy of buying the company s own obligations when they were selling at bargain prices. That profit amounted to $372,850. There is considerable difference of opinion as to whether such profits should be taken into income, or credited to surplus. Rolling Mill has another opportunity now to buy Its own obligations, for the 4>i% notes, due next November 1, are again below 50.
Railroad Credit Corp. Receipts
The surcharges granted by the Interstate Commerce Commission In early January, 1032, yielded the railroads $61,625,708 for the year. The net railway operating income of Class 1 roads in 1932 was $334,221,999; the surcharges constituted just a little less than 20r,<
The Interstate Commerce Commission now has before it the question of continuing the surcharges. A month ago. carrier officials quite generally felt there was little chance that the commission would grant an extension, but there has been a definite change recently, with more optimism expressed on the likelihood of extension. If the commission fails to extend them, the surcharges will end March 31. The resultant loss in revenues to the carriers would be severe, and there is, at the moment, little prospect of an increase in traffic that would bring in revenues enough to offset it.
The •'Demand for Things**
The steepness of the rally, Friday, was attributed in a number of quarters to a sudden "demand for things". In several brokerage house** cuatomers who had accumulated «ub-
