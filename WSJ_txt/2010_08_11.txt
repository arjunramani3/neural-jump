NEW YORK -- Markets entered a second day of fitful, fear-driven trading Thursday, as a weak U.S. jobless claims report, volatile currency trading and growing doubts over policy options led investors to again sell stocks and seek out havens such as the dollar.
"The U.S. markets woke up this week and really smelled the napalm," said Steve Baffico, senior managing director at Claymore Securities. "The inevitability of a very rocky recovery just becomes that much more apparent."
Adding to people's nerves, technology bellwether Cisco Systems Inc. offered a gloomy assessment of the economic outlook during an after-the-bell earnings announcement Wednesday evening. Although its quarterly earnings surged 79% on the year, investors focused on Cisco's warnings about a deteriorating outlook, causing its stock to drop 9.3% in trading Thursday.
With other stocks following Cisco's lead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.59% at 10317.91 in recent trading and the S&P 500 was down 0.55% at 1082.99. This follows Wednesday's 2.5% drop in the Dow and 2.8% decline in the S&P.
Adding to the pessimistic undertone, the Labor Department reported before the stock market's opening that weekly jobless claims unexpectedly jumped by 2,000 to 484,000, the highest level in six months.
This helped sustain demand for U.S. Treasurys and other safe-haven government bonds such as German bunds and U.K. gilts. However, the strong recent gains seen in two- and 10-year Treasury notes kept their gains in check while people shifted to higher-yielding 30-year bonds, whose appeal was strengthened by the jobless data, which quashed any residual inflation concerns.
In recent days, the "long bond" had lagged gains in two- and 10-year Treasury notes, which were helped by the Federal Reserve's announcement on that it would modestly increase its purchases of those securities. Recently, the 30-year Treasury was quoted up 9/32 with a yield of 3.913%, while the 10-year note was down 2/32 to yield 2.729% and the two-year was down 1/32 with a yield of 0.537%.
"Money managers and insurance companies are forced to the 30-year bonds to grab yields. You have a slowing economy, no inflation, the Fed buying Treasurys, which all pushed bond yields lower," said Tom di Galoma, head of U.S. rates trading at Guggenheim Partners in New York. "The jump in jobless claims is another nail in the coffin for the economy."
Though the 30-year bond was up earlier in the day, it fell modestly after a relatively weak auction of 30-year bonds. The 30-year was recently quoted down 5/32 with a yield of 3.937%, while the 10-year note was down 7/32 to yield 2.744% and the two-year was down 2/32 with a yield of 0.545%.
Overnight threats of intervention from Japanese officials during Asian trading hours helped bring the Japanese yen down from 15-year highs against the dollar and in turn drove some demand for the euro in European trading. With London desks preparing to close, traders there further offloaded yen positions to avoid being caught out by yenselling intervention. But the overall preference for safety kept the euro falling against the dollar.
The euro was recently quoted at $1.2844, down from $1.2882 late Wednesday. The dollar was at 85.92 yen, up from 85.37 yen late Wednesday. Overnight, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the yen's rise had been "a little too rapid" and the Bank of Japan was seen in the market asking for quotes, a sign that it might be preparing intervention.
"They're talking, but there's nothing apoplectic that would make the BOJ act now," said Simon Smollet, senior foreign exchange options strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in London. As for the euro, he said its decline reflected "the nagging feeling that the [global] recovery is going to be hard work." He predicted that the euro will reach $1.15 or $1.12 by year end.
In the midst of all this, a sharp decline in the Chinese yuan's rate against the dollar overnight stoked concern about potential trade tensions between the U.S. and China following Wednesday's news of a $10 billion blowout in the U.S. trade deficit.
This worldwide sense of investor unease has fueled a bout of seemingly contrarian demand for gold, which normally functions as a hedge against inflation. Although the data suggest that deflation, not inflation, is the biggest risk right now, the gold contract for December delivery was recently up $16.60, or 1.4%, at $1,215.80 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The intraday high of $1,218.50 is the contract's highest point since July 15.
Demand for gold reflects the fact that "the market is very worried" about the failure of policy to stabilize international financial markets, said George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures in New York.
"Nothing has worked," he said, noting the apparent failure of the Fed's modest "quantitative easing" measure this week.

Oil, on the other hand, continued to decline in line with most growth-sensitive asset markets. Crude futures were recently down $1.9% to $76.57 a barrel after falling as low
as $76.05 in earlier trading, the lowest level since July.
The slide follows Wednesday's 2.8% decline -- the biggest one-day drop in six weeks, when data on U.S. oil supplies showing rising stockpiles of gasoline and other oil products helped to exacerbate the impact of the economic outlook.
"The macroeconomic factor has taken a dramatic shift this week towards a reduced appetite for risk," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates, which tracks the oil market. "And fundamentals are becoming more bearish than bullish."
