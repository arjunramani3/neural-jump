Some of the New York spirit
affects holders of less than $400,000 principal amount of the notes. These holders, who have deposited their notes but have not made the actual exchange for 25*%> in cash and new notes for the balance; now can get back their old notes, or can still make the exchange.
So far, the B. & O. drive for its refinancing proposal has been the most successful of any similar attempt made by a railroad recently. If it is carried through without acute difficulties with holdouts, it will be one of the notable events of the forepart of 1933.
Trice Reductions and Inventories
By making the cigarette price reduction effective early in January, instead of a week previous, the tobacco companies saved themselves inventory adjustments in their 1932 accounts. If ‘the adjustment had come before the year-end, writedowns would have been necessary. While tobacco companies usually do not have large stocks of manufactured cigarettes on hand, the inventory question was undoubtedly a factor in fixing the date for the effectiveness of the new price scale.
Armco Buys Own Obligations
American Rolling Mill Co. is another which must be added to the growing list of companies which, during 1932, took advantage of depreciated prices for its oblications to buy them in and retire them. The bond market last year was a trying one for the investor, but for companies strong in cash, it afforded a rare opportunity to scale down their debts advantageously. The oil companies, as a group, made the greatest progress along these lines, but there are other important examples. The companies ln-

The markets derived a good deal of nourishment from Washington news. Congress decided that the domestic allotment plan for farmrelief would be given consideration on Thursday, and this gave a stimulus to the commodity markets. Speaker Garner’s insistence that balancing of the budget was the first duty of the current Congressional session bolstered sentiment. and helped the bond market. Then, too. the prospect that Congress would give the incoming Administration wide latitude and full support m any measures looking to Government reorganization, reducing expenses. * other important matters was structive.

Little Resistance to Upturn
The technical situation in the market furnished a good setting for a rally. A fair-sized short interest has been accumulated in some of the leading stocks, and there were no very important offerings in the area immediately above. When real bidding for stocks got under way, prices moved upward easily. Allied Chemical, for instance, jumped of a point between sales, and Telephone fairly shot ahead between 106 and the close of 107% Steel common was called on to absorb considerable stock between 28 and 30.
As a group, the railroad shares did extremely well. There was an insistent demand for Pennsylvania, New York Central. Union Pacific and Atchison, with Union Pacific up on the day. Atchison up 3%, and Central and Pennsylvania each up more than a point. Rails were buoyed by the upward movement in junior bonds, as well as by the relief from selling pressure. Tobacco stocks continued their forward movement, which began with the announcement of the price cut Short covering helped in putting the market up in thc«c stocks and m the steels.
The day’s news, nutside of the developments in Washington, contained a few i nteresting items. Steel production, as estimated by Dow-Jones & Co . the week ended Monday was about 1% ahead of the preceding seven days. Shutdowns over the year-end were not as extensive as those over the Christmas holiday season, and operations made a better showing than anticipated by the industry. Railroad loadings figures were mixed One of the interesting items of rail news was the default by the Frisco of interest due in November on a loan from the R. F. C. The default was the first on an R F. C. carrier loan.
Inflationary talk in Washington had repercussions in the foreign exchange market. Guilders and francs were strong agatnst the dollar. Abroad, the remarks of S-n«t<»r Borah, and others, on currency were seized on as the basis for speculation against the dollar Foreign markets were lower, both in London and in Pans.
Investment Trust Showings
Initial reports from investment trusts, covering operations in the final quarter of 193-., show that they did pretty well with the selective market which prevailed during the last three monthb of the year. The Dow-Joncs industrial average, at the year-end. was off 16.2% from the level on September 30, and the rail average was off 26.2%. The first three investment trusts reporting showed declines in asset values of their shares of only about 8% in the same period.
The year was another period of loss-taking for the first three trusts through sales of securities. Balance sheets show that the spread between cost and market prices of securities held nt the year-end was a good deal smaller than at the end of the previous year, indicating that the process of weeding out unfortunate commitments was bearing fruit.
A Head and Head Race
The Nickel Plate and the Baltimore & Ohio arc running a head and head race in the matter of getting security holders to deposit their obligations under the refinancing proposals submitted by the two roads. The Nickel Plate had a three-months start on its rival, but it had an offsetting handicap in the fact that its plan provides only for payment of 25% in cash, while the B. & O. security holder gets 50% in cash.
The critical date for both roads will be March 1. On that day, the B. & O. bonds Involved in the readjustment plan become duo, and the Nickel Plate has heavy interest payments to meet. An far as the Nickel Plate is concerned, it is highly doubtful whether the Reconstruction Finance Corp, will approve an additional loan to the road if the refinancing program has not been put through.
The expiration of the deposit agreement, under which Nickel Plate noteholders have been turning in their securities, means very little. It
