Analysis, of Motor Industry by Dow, Jones & Co. .
■	first article in Dow, Jones & Co. series on the
motor companies brings out the fact that 1918 will show a new high record in business for. the automobile industry. The passenger car; output will be decreased ■ from 25% to 30%, this , statement disputing the careless statements spread throughout the country that curtailment vvill be as high as 70%. The added business given to the motor companies by the Government will far exceed the loss in pleasure car business. This loss, in pleasure car-business may reach $250,000,000, .whereas new orders from the business for the full year should reach $1,000,000,000. A total of $500,000,000 for trucks, motors, shells, aeroplane parts, cannon parts, etc.,-have already been placed. The automo-hile was an innovation when it first made its appearance. It displaced the horse. It is worth noting that while this displacement has been going bn since the nineties there are still over 20,000,000 horses in the United States. •
Low-Priced Industrials Favored	•-
. Low priced industrials were favored in trie second half hour. They were taken up one at u time and rushed up 1 to 2 points each. These include Cuba Cane Sugar, Corn Products, Ohio Cities Gas,’ Columbia Gas, and American Can. It was easy to get a following in these stories, all of them having a special group of enthusiasts.............
American Can was favored on account of its prospects,
of dividends in the first quarter of 191S.
Cuba Cane Sugar
The recent annual report of Cuba Cane Sugar showed ?7.63 a share on the common.- Adding the $19.10 earned in the previous year makes an equity in two years of nearly $27, almost equivalent to the present market price of the stock. Cuba Cane should have a big year in 1918. The fixed price for Cuban raw sugar is higher than the average obtained in 1917 and a good profit is assured on the new basis.	.
An Industrial Market of Large Proportions
Rails did not share in the general activity. It was an industrial market of large proportions, and peace talk had nothing to do with the rise. This was evidenced by the fact that the old-line w-ar shares were among the most ac-

tive.
- The. last 'itock inarket session of./the year 1917 was _ an-interesting affair.. Investors made a last'day rush ; to , : ’ pick up good railroad and industrial securities ’ at prevailing levels." The prices, naturally, were' attraciye, when compared vrith the high prices of the 1916 and 1917 bull markets.’ The action of the market indicated further that liquidation was'at ah end, and that pessimism has given way to optimism. ’	'	■''--■ ?' ,■■■'<• -' "■■
■;■’ The market was very broad. Inquiry for rails fell off but prices were steady. ’Motor stocks received most attention and trading inthese issues was stimulated by publication' by. Dow, Jones & Co. of important statistics bearing on the motor industry. Other facts .are to follow in a series of articles and it will be apparent to students of business that .the hysterica] depression in motor stocks was not warranted by the facts. ’ Steels, coppers, leather, shipping, malt and gas stocks were also in great demand.
Although the Kaiser , was struggling in the last day of the year for a general peace, this peace talk was in no manner a factor inthe stock market. Wall Street has accepted the advice recentlygiven. by Mr. Lamont of the Morgan firm. ■ Mr. Lamont, it will-'-be recalled, sounded a warning that .the United States should prepare for the war campaigns of 1913 and 1919. " It has been realized now. by -the'many rather than by the few that the United States must more than make up to. the Allies what the defection of Russia has entailed. .	,
. Prices at' the end of the year were far below the closing prices of a year -ago. This suggests the obvious conclusion .that the results of; the year's operations of industrials and railroads have not been discounted at present price levels. The prosperity.-of 1917, it might be said, was measured in advance in the bull market which culminated in the fall of 1916. The big earnings of 1917, despite the heavy excess profits taxes, could be used now as a basis for another bull market and the prospects for 1918 could be thrown in for good measure. ; It is true that the sentimental side of a bull market must be taken into consideration in this instance for with the country at war there is naturally not the same inducement on the part of financial, interests to support a big wave, of enthusiasm in the stock market. Whether there is to be a dull market or not makes little difference. Bargains exist in bonds and stocks which are bound to attract money. The passing of the hysteria as a result of the Government’s constructive policy towards the railroads should give, opportunitv for the appreciation of every bargain on the list. '	’	.
•-:;’i	. Industrials Buoyant at Opening J.

General Motprs rose a point between sales in the first ^eir c°al investments. Presumably the Government does half hour and showed a net gain,of 5% at 106. This was not intePd to touch this other ■ income account. On this the feature of the early trading! - It is recalled that the assumPtion there has been selective buying of the stocks Chevrolet Motor Co., which owns 450,000'shares of Gen- of companies which will share, greater prosperity because of their outside investments. . Some mystery will be left to such stocks, it is contended, whereas the stories of railroad companies which engage solely in transportation may reach a level where the speculative features disappear.	.	.	..	.
Selling for Cash	'
Market held near the top in the second hour. Newcomers which showed up. particularly strong were Distillers, Central Leather, American Locomotive' and Brooklyn Rapid Transit. There were, many sales for cash, probably indicating & desire on theJ part of holders to balance books before the,year’s end. Sales in ten different stocks for cash appeared on the tape.
Union Pacific sold up % to 114%. Canadian Pacific sold up 2% from the low to 139%. Both of these stocks had been, weak early in the morning. Missouri Pacific preferred gained a point.
Chesapeake & Ohio’s Favorable Position
Chesapeake & Ohio: was well taken and gained• % to 51%. It will be recalled that Chesapeake’s dividend rate was reduced from a 5% 'basis to a 4%- basis in 1913, riot on account pf poor; earnings but in order to meet 'certain financial requirements made by the road’s bankers. Since the Government’s allowance to Chesapeake will be over 9% on the stock, .there is a belief in some quarters that the old 0% rate could be re-established'with safety.;
.?	Coppers. Take the Lead	:
" ; Copper stocks came to the front in the early afternoon Utah was taken up 2%-,to 80%,^Inspiration 1% to 45% and Anaconda 2 points;’:.to 61. The buying move really started in Inspiration which has been accumulated-for some time. International Nickel gained 2% to 28%. National Conduit, which is a large consumer of copper, gained 2% to 16%. Some prominent interests Who were long of National Conduit at 35^ sold their stock around 20 and look the short side.	.	\:
Westinghouse, selling ex-dividend 75 cents a share became active and gained? 1% to 40'%. Distillers made a high st 3®%. Central Leather rushed up 2 points to 64. Corn Products made n high at 30%, up 1%. .	‘
. Steel Common 10 Points Lower Than Year Ago
The,principal foature- was Steel common, which sold up 1% to 90. When tho market turned for the better some of the largest interests in the Street predicted that Steel common would touch CO- on the move, but' they did not suggest that this price ^onld bo reached so soon. A year ago’Steel wa3 selling 10 points higher. ■ ’.	.
Atlantic-Gulf gained 8% to 97%. Directors of the Atlantic-Gulf met lost Friday, but took no action on an extra dividend. The stock held up very well on the announcement, and made an easy rise in the early afternoon of trading. • .i, _
Coppers and Tobaccos
Copper stocks, like the motors, had been very much neglected. The Street had so generally expected reductions in the dividends of leading copper companies that it sold copper stocks without discrimination. These stocks came to life in the late afternoon, and-showed good form. Utah Copper gained a total qf 3% to 82%. Anaconda and Inspiration also made new highs. In sympathy with the coppers International Nickel was strong, and sold at 29, up 3. Air indications point ton continuation of the fixed price of 23% cents for copper for at least another lour months.
