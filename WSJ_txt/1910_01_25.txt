tog the polity of. the Administration, and “to return to its old estimate ol Mr. Taft as a safe jand sane President, who, while correcting abuses and suppressing trusts , and combinations of dealers which are in some measure re-j sponsdble for the high prices of connnodities, would rtape his course so as to disturb to the smallest possible extent the general business Of the country.	:
Around 1 o’clock a bear raid was made upon Reading: and one or two other stocks, apparently for the purpose' ports in the morning papers of the alleged intention of | the	a*d alBO Great Northern
President Taft to enter upon a vigorous campaign for tae p	'
enforcement of the anti-trust law against corporations pro- . duced a most serious effect, and the market was only saved from utter demoralization by the rendering of support by the large interests after declines had assumed large proper- i tions. Holders of stocks, not only those whose interest was ; purely speculative, but many of the investment or semi- ; investment class, were compelled by necessity or urged by < their fears into throwing their holdings on the market, so | that, notwithstanding the heavy buying by the large iqter- : ests, prices as a rule fell to much lower levels than those i reached in last week’s break. The transactions Teached the heavy total of 1,625,000 shares, half of which was done before 11:45 a. m., by which time the heaviest of the liquidation appeared to have been completed. From about noon the market showed a tendency to recover in an irregular sort of way, and although a little before the close certain prominent issues, like United States Steel, Reading and Amalgamated Copper, fell to new low levels, these declines appeared to result from raiding by the bears, who apparently took advantage of the weakness thus produced to cover shorts in other parts of the market. At the end, declines ran all through the active list, the losses generally amounting to two points and upwards. The Steel dividend, announced after the close, was quite generally regarded as a compromise.
Heavy over-night declines.
The opening was very weak, with the largest overnight declines witnessed in a long time. The Street felt very nervous over the sensational reports in the papers regarding the alleged intention of the Administration to conduct a vigorous anti-trust crusade, and attention was directed towards Washington to a greater extent than at any other time since Mr. Roosevelt walked out of the White House and Mr. Taft walked in.
. The opening on Steel embraced 12,000 shares, at prices running from 83% down to 82%, against a price of 83% at Monday’s close. The subject of the dividend or the statement of earnings for the quarter seemed to be entirely forgotten in the general alarm over the antitrust -talk. The Steel Corporation has been the subject of investigation by the Department of Commerce and Labor for a long time, but the Administration has not arrived at the conclusion that it is a ‘-bud" trust.
Amalgamated Copper behaved very badly at the start, opening at 81% and running off to 80 on a few sales as against a closing price of 82% on Monday. Naturally there was an inclination to believe that the combination of copper interests talked of some time ago would not now be attempted.
The initial decline in Consolidated Gas amounted to 2% points. Mr. Cortelvou's statement about the lack of increase per capita in consumption of gas being regarded as unfavorable.
Forced liquidation.
Enormous activity followed the opening, and there was a heavy volume of liquidation from speculative holders of stocks whose margins had become exhausted and other holders who had become alarmed over the prospect that the Administration, nt first regarded as very conservative, might become even more strenuous in its attacks upon corporations than that of President Roosevelt.
There was heavy selling of lhe Harriman stocks, and these showed little rallying power, being affected by the widespread belief that the anti-trust suit against Union and Southern Pacific would be vigorously prosecuted.
Reading, which was one of the first stocks to open, started at 159%. down only a point, over night; but % quickly declined to 156. rumor asserting that a great effort would be made to dissolve the alleged coal trust. The activity in the stock was on a very large scale. -
Steel appeared to be well supported at the lower level, the large interests which bought the stock in quantity last week being apparently willing to render support when it again got down to about the same level. .
Sentiment depressed.
Support rendered to prevent demoralization had the effect of cheeking the decline, but only for a little while, and at the end of the first hour prices of the leading stocks fell lower than before. .Sentiment was very much depressed, and commission houses were advising their customers to lighten their holdings of stocks on all rallies.
In conservative quarters the view was expressed that the reports as to the Administration’s intentions regarding enforcement of the anti-trust act were greatly exaggerated, and that while Mr. Taft intended that the law should be enforced against all "bad" trusts, care would be exercised to bring no proceedings except where good grounds were believed to exist, anti to have in every instance a proper repaid for the business interests of the country.
There are two ways to enforce the anti-trust law, and Mr. Taft is likely to adopt the right one.
Disturbing rumors of a kind which usually accompany n violent break in the market were put in circulation, but it is more likely that they were a result of the decline than a cause contributing to it.
After a violent break to 80. as compared with a closing price of 85% on Monday night, Chesapeake & Ohio met with support and in a comparatively short time recovered about half its decline.
Renewed weakness.
In the early part of the second hour stocks again showed weakness, and there was an utter lack of support' in many issues, the effect being to increase the apprehension of somethin^ hanging over the market. Traders argued that the vague reports in the papers as to the Administration's anti-trust policy hardly sufficed as explanation of the heavy outpouring of stocks and the demoralized break in prices.
Consolidated Gas fell heavily, meeting with no support on its decline and catching stop orders on the way down. The decline from the high of a few weeks ago amounted to upward of twenty points.
Unenviable distinction as the weakest of the standard railroad issues was held by Union Pacific, which fell seven points from the highest of Monday and to a level much lower than was reached at the time of Mr. Harriman's death or in last week’s decline.
Selling of Beet Sugar attracted attention, the traders ascribing it to well informed quarters; and the fact that a very poor market existed for stocks of this kind was one of the reasons why commission houses were still inclined to advise liquidation.
A better tone.
In the second hour the market developed a somewhat better tone, and toward the end of the period activity fell off to a very marked extent, the result probably of the completion of the most urgent of the liquidation whicn had resulted in the heavy decline in prices. The attendance in the commission houses became thinned out to small proportions, and most of these firms had their holdings of stocks reduced much below the amount carried on their books at the end of last week.
One satisfactory feature of the market was the comparative strength of New York Central and Pennsylvania, of which no special explanation was heard, the reason for the good action of these atocks being probably that the speculative account in them had not been as heavy as in certain other issues.
The Hill stocks acted fairly well, the probability being that on last week’s decline these issues had become pretty thoroughly liquidated.
Up to about 11:45 o’clock the transactions in all stocks amounted to about 810,000 shares, and there is no doubt whatever that the Street absorbed a great amount of liquidation.
London was a buyer of between 25,000 and 30,000 shares of stock and was nt a loss for an explanation of the extreme weakness here. The market on the other side was at all times about half a point above the level in New York, and the impression abroad regarding President Taft’s attitudo was certainly much more favorable than it was in Wall street. The foreigners would like to see fuller control exorcised over corporations than has been exercised heretofore.
Liquidation completed.
In the early afternoon the market showed a fair return of strength, the liquidation having apparently been about completed, while a large short interest still remained uncovered. The probability la that stocks arc at present
closedactive and irregular.
Prices broke badly on heavy liquidation, but in the afternoon an irregular rally occurred, which at no time < possessed any viRor. Sales, 1,625,856 shares.
Ore.	.	,
Waiting on Steel.
In the late afternoon the market was comparatively quiet and fairly steady awaiting 'action on the United States Steel dividend, without any particular pressure of stocks or any great anxiety on the part of the shorts to cover contracts. The bears raided Union Pacific, Amalgamated Copper and two or three other stocks, as they had raided Reading two hours before, but without much effect on the general list. Stocks appeared to be getting scarce.
In the most prominent banking circles the belief was expressed that Mr. Taft in his proceedings against the trusts was moved by a sincere desire for the best interests of the community, but that he seemed to make the mistake of considering himself the supreme interpreter of the law. The anti-trust law, it was argued, should be made so plain that any one could interpret it, so that no corporation managers would be deterred from doing what they had a legal right to do because of a misunderstanding of its provisions or exonerated from doing what was illegal because of ignorance of the meaning of a vague measure.
Some disappointment was felt because the rally was not more vigorous, but in conservative quarters the view was taken that if prices were rallied sharply the market might again go off on the news from the Steel meeting, whereas if the short interest were retained for the present a substantial upward movement might occur later in week.
