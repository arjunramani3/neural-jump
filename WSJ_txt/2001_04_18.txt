New York Stock Exchange trading volume was the second heaviest in its history, at 1.90 billion shares (the record was 2.09 billion on Jan. 4 of this year). Nasdaq Stock Market volume just missed the all-time record, clocking in at nearly 3.08 billion shares. The record of 3.09 billion was set Jan. 3; that was the last time the Fed surprised the markets with a rate cut, touching off a record 14% Nasdaq rally that day that dissipated in subsequent weeks.
Even to pros, the Fed news hit out of the blue yesterday morning. Mark Boutote, of the firm Direct Brokerage who trades stocks on the exchange floor, was looking at the price of SunTrust Banks when it suddenly popped up $2, to more than $65. The trader next to him started shouting as orders to buy 200,000 shares flooded into the trading system. The computer screen "lit up like a Christmas tree," Mr. Boutote said. Investors almost had given up hope of a rate cut before the Fed's May policy meeting, and the news "was an absolute shock," he said. "Everyone got caught by surprise. It was the loudest I've ever heard this place." Within minutes, the Dow industrials were up almost 300 points. Many traders were so busy they spent the lunch hour racing back and forth across the floor, eating sandwiches on the run.
Nasdaq's 26.9% gain during the past two weeks puts it technically in a bull market, using the standard rule that a 20% gain confirms the onset of a bull market. But with the volatile index still down 15.8% so far this year, and 58.8% off last year's record close, many investors said they won't be convinced the Nasdaq bear market is over until they see a longer, more sustained advance. Moreover, the broad S&P 500 still is up only 12% from its recent low, so no one is claiming that stocks in general are in a bull market.

Another surprise interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve sparked another strong rally in the stock market, with the Nasdaq Composite Index surging 8.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising nearly 4%.
The question for many investors: Is this rally for real, in contrast with several other short-lived run-ups since stocks began their bear-market drop last year?
The answer, traders and investors say, may depend on whether investors are more fearful of missing out if the market keeps going up, or more worried that the economic outlook will remain cloudy.
Bulls have been encouraged to see stock prices "reacting extremely well compared to the earnings numbers we are seeing," said Tim Heekin, director of trading at San Francisco investment bank Thomas Weisel Partners. Skeptics, however, say they are stunned by the idea that investors would jump back into tech stocks, in particular, after their collapse of the past year.
For a day, at least, euphoria ruled. Coming on top of the favorable business-climate forecast issued by Intel late Tuesday, news of the half-point cut in the Fed's short-term interest-rate guideline had both professional traders and small investors gleeful.
On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, traders began screaming and hurrying to place orders as the news broke just before 11 a.m. EDT. At investment bank Salomon Smith Barney, the surprise rate cut was such a relief that traders at the firm let out shouts of delight as the news broke, with some corporate-bond traders exchanging high-fives.
The Nasdaq composite's percentage surge was its fourth-biggest one-day gain ever. It finished 156.22 points higher at 2079.44 -- the first finish over 2000 in more than a month. The leap came just two weeks after the Nasdaq index recorded its third-biggest gain ever, on April 5. After rising almost every day since then, the index, dominated by beaten-down technology stocks, is up 26.9% in just nine trading days.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 399.10 points to close at 10615.83. That was the index's third-sharpest point gain ever, although the percentage gain of 3.9% wasn't among the top 40. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.89%, helped by its many technology stocks, but hurt by its more stable drug and consumer-products names, which investors abandoned to push money back into the suddenly hot tech names.
New York Stock Exchange trading volume was the second heaviest in its history, at 1.90 billion shares (the record was 2.09 billion on Jan. 4 of this year). Nasdaq Stock Market volume just missed the all-time record, clocking in at nearly 3.08 billion shares. The record of 3.09 billion was set Jan. 3; that was the last time the Fed surprised the markets with a rate cut, touching off a record 14% Nasdaq rally that day that dissipated in subsequent weeks.
Treasury bonds also posted gains, based partly on a view that the Fed is seeing signs of economic weakness that will make it cut its base rates again at its next policy meeting, on May 15.
Traders said the ability of stocks to sustain gains will depend heavily on investors' willingness to tap their "cash," removing money from safe keeping and putting it back at risk in the market. That decision, in turn, will depend on the belief that actions such as the Fed rate cuts will help the economy avoid recession, reversing some of the abysmal earnings declines posted by some corporations so far this year.

news "was an absolute shock," he said. "Everyone got caught by surprise. It was the loudest I've ever heard this place." Within minutes, the Dow industrials were up almost 300 points. Many traders were so busy they spent the lunch hour racing back and forth across the floor, eating sandwiches on the run.
Nasdaq's 26.9% gain during the past two weeks puts it technically in a bull market, using the standard rule that a 20% gain confirms the onset of a bull market. But with the volatile index still down 15.8% so far this year, and 58.8% off last year's record close, many investors said they won't be convinced the Nasdaq bear market is over until they see a longer, more sustained advance. Moreover, the broad S&P 500 still is up only 12% from its recent low, so no one is claiming that stocks in general are in a bull market.
More reassuring earnings news arrived after regular trading ended: International Business Machines reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenue performance. Its stock rose 5.9% in after-hours trading. Investors' willingness to continue buying stocks on that news would be another indication of how sustained the current rally can be. Microsoft is to report its earnings after regular trading ends today.
No one can be sure to what extent individual investors will be prompted to take some of the billions of dollars residing in money-market funds and move that into stocks.
To do so, they will have to overcome their shock at some of the corporate news received in recent months. This has been a period when inventories have soared, major corporations have had to acknowledge accounting errors and restate their results, and some young telecommunications companies have stumbled under the weight of excessive debt, moving dangerously close to bankruptcy filings. Even after the Fed news and the huge stock gains, investors still are talking about the decision by networking company Cisco Systems, one of the technology world's blue-chip names, to write off $2.5 billion in inventory, a staggering sum.
One result is that some professional investors still aren't jumping into the market with both feet, but instead are waiting to be sure the gains will hold. Traders said that much of the buying yesterday, as has been the case for several days now, came from hedge funds, which are investment partnerships that often specialize in trying to react quickly to market moves. More staid institutions, such as pension funds and mutual funds, tend to react more slowly, and some of them still are expressing skepticism that this rally has staying power.
Until the current rally, 10 of the 11 biggest one-day Nasdaq percentage moves had come during the long decline that began a little more than one year ago; each had been wiped out by later selling. Conservative investors want to be sure that won't happen this time.
One concern, said John O'Donoghue, co-head of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, is that it is hard to figure what bad news the Fed had that provoked the surprise rate move. "One has to sit back a bit and say, 'Why would the Fed do such a thing with some of the numbers that have come out in the last few days?' " he said.
Three things could push professional investors to stop worrying and put more money into the market. First would be more positive earnings news and commentary from companies. Second would be more market gains, which could make it too painful for people to stay away. And third, Mr. O'Donoghue said, would be the very effect of the rate cuts, which reduce the return available from money-market funds and make them less attractive compared with stocks.
As is usually the case, the Fed move triggered a drop in the prime rate at major banks. That will make it cheaper for some consumers to borrow, but also will reduce the rates paid to investors in some money-market accounts.
Thomas Galvin, investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said money-market funds, as a percentage of the Wilshire 5000 Index, are at their most swollen levels since 1982.
But some money recently has been shifting out of such funds. According to Money Fund Report, published by iMoneyNet Inc., U.S. money-market funds lost a net $37.61 billion for the week ended Tuesday, bringing total money-market assets to about $2 trillion.
And market-research firm Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn., agrees that investors seem to be putting more cash into stocks. Birinyi measures the volume of stock that trades on price "upticks," which it uses as an indicator of buy orders, and compares that to trades on "downticks," signaling sell orders. It has found far more stocks trading mainly on upticks than on downticks, from which Birinyi concludes that professional investors are quietly accumulating those stocks.
Investors will be looking for further signs that people are moving less money into cash, and beginning to shift some to stocks. Until then, skepticism about the market's ability to sustain its gains will remain.
On top of everything else, influential Goldman Sachs investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen weighed in with a reiteration of her view that stocks are due to register sharp gains this year, amid an improving economic environment. Ironically, Ms. Cohen's positive comments followed her decision to trim her estimates for corporate earnings this year. That in turn made her cut her forecast for the year-end value of the S&P 500 to 1550 from 1650, and for the Dow industrials to 12500 from 13000. Even her reduced forecasts call for big gains; if the S&P 500 hits her target it will be up another 25% from here, on top of its recent gains.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 2.71%, or 3.75 points, to 142.06.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks advanced. On the New York Stock Exchange, 2,050 stocks rose and 1,061 declined.
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 18/32, or $5.63 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to the bond's price, fell to 5.122%. The 30-year bond was up 3/32 to yield 5.642%.
The dollar fell. Late in New York, it traded at 88.52 cents to the euro and 122.31 yen, weakening from 88.39 cents and 123.33 yen.
