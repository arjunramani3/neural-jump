NEW YORK-The weekend budget accord together with a slip in oil prices sent stock prices surging.
Meanwhile, some technical analysts began predicting a stock market rally that could carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average back into the 2700s. Lehman Brothers technical analyst Elaine Garzarelli says her stock market indicators gave a clear buy signal, suggesting a rally ol 10'7 to 12'7 from current levels.
The industrial average jumped 03.311 points to 25I5.SI—its strongest one-day gain In more than a month.
Among broader indexes. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rallied 8.89 to 314.94, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 4.37 to 172.22 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained
8.1.3	to 291.12.
Advancing Issues outnumbered decliners by 1.203 to 442. Volume on the Big Board totaled 202,210,000 shares, about even with Friday's 201,010,000 shares.
The advance swept stock prices higher across the board-witlt the notable exception of gold and oil-related shares. Gold prices fell, while crude oil for November delivery slid S2.42 to S37.09 a barrel in New York trading.
Investors were met yesterday morning with the welcome news of a weekend compromise between the White House and congressional leaders over a plan to cut the federal budget deficit. While an agreement had been anticipated, the move was seen by some as a first step toward lower interest rates.
Perhaps more important to investor confidence was a milder tone to the conflict in the Middle East.
Iraqi leader Saddatn Hussein had responded favorably to a hint last week by France that Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait could speed a resolution of Arab-Israeli disputes. And yesterday. President Bush appeared to echo France's sentiment in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly.
The subtle shift in tone helped bring oil prices down, and egged on stock buyers.
Mitch Meisler, executive vice president of worldwide equities at tollman Brothers, says he believes yesterday’s strength was more than a “oneday blast."
But not everyone believes that the gains of the past two sessions were the beginnings of a sustainable rally.
"This is simply a bounce in a bear market,” says Thom R. Brown, managing director at Rutherford Brown & Catherwood. "I don't really think we hit bottom last week." Mr. Brown believes that the market is more likely to drop an additional 10% to 12%. He says he expects the market to begin showing signs of weakness again by tomorrow.
William Helman, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, agrees that it is premature to look for sustainable gains. But
he mills that it may be a question of needing more time before the market is ready to rally, rather than of falling to lower levels.
Some of the worst hit stocks last week topped the day’s most active list.
I’hlllp Morris, which gained 2% to 47’.i. was the most active issue with volume of more than 3.5 million shares. PepsiCo added '-j to 23 'a. General Electric gained l"i to 56'i and Citicorp added %to 15%.
