Abreast of the Market
A Stock Market Appraisal—
By Victor J. Hilusy
Despite the stock market’s recent burst of strength, some money managers and analysts aren’t yet ready to haul down the caution flags.
“It was a psychology of overpessimism that pushed the market down sharply and a change in that psychology on which it bounced back, but I don't think this rally will be a one-way street," says E. Douglas Howard U, president of the $76 million Niagara Share Corp. He adds: “There will probably be a slide back and this will determine whether the market can hold above its recent lows. And an even stiffer test will be the market’s reaction to second quarter earnings, which I think will be worse than first quarter results.”
Robert M. Smith, senior vice president of Keystone Custodian Funds Inc., which runs 13 mutual funds with assets of $1.25 billion, thinks the rally was a technical reaction because the market was “oversold to an unprecedented extent.” He asserts: “We think the market will pull back again to test its lows and that it’s possible the industrial average will go below the lows.”
After an uninterrupted 71.65-point drop in six sessions, the Dow Jones industrial average last Tuesday hit a 7’+-year low of 631.16. It then jumped 69.28 points in three days, including a record 32,04-point spurt the first day. It closed Friday at 700.44, after rising 16.29 points for the day.
Noting that he doesn't look for a fast turn, Mr. Smith suggests: “It will take time for people to get back their confidence.” He explains: “The U.S. move into Cambodia shook up a lot of people. And even though we're committed to a fast pullout, there’s the polarization of opinion and other social problems that will take time to work out.”
As for the economy, he states: “The chips are falling into place, but it's taking longer than we anticipated. We expect second quarter earnings to be down more than in the first quarter (when they fell 11% before taxes from the year-earlier period). But we’re looking for the economy to pick up later this year and also for a decline in interest rates.”
Labor Unions Last Holdouts
In the battle against inflation, Mr. Smith says that “profit margins will be the battleground.” He explains: “Productivity will be low until we get an economic upturn. Companies will find it difficult to raise prices. And unions will be demanding wage increases. I think inflationary expectations have been broken among businessmen and also among consumers. The last holdouts are the labor unions that are still demanding big pay increases.”
Inflation’s continued stubborn hold on the economy was indicated by the preliminary report last week that wholesale prices were rising in May at 0.2% after holding steady in April. What was disappointing to Mr. Smith and some others was that the industrial commodities index was continuing to gain at a 3.6% annual pace.
Democratic Congressmen called for wage, price, profit and credit controls last week and a House subcommittee approved a bill that would require the President’s economic advisers to set wage-price guidelines and the President to try to get business to follow them. And according to Albert Gordon, Kidder Peabody & Co. chairman, Mr. Nixon stated at his meeting with a group of business leaders last week that he feels some sort of persuasive tactics might be necessary to combat wage and price rises if current policies don’t bring results.
Noting that recent pressure on the stock market has stemmed from fears on the one hand of a serious business slump and on the other of further inflation and still higher interest rates, Richard E. Scruggs, Goodbody & Co. economist, asserts that “since these conditions are incompatible, the fears would

seem to be unwarranted.” He observes that although prices are still rising and unemployment increasing, “this whiplash effect as the economy decelerates to a more moderate and sustainable growth rate is as normal and logical as it is temporary.” He adds that the Administration’s “game plan would seem to be running pretty close to its outline” and "an easing in the economy—not full-scale recession, but merely a more moderate rate of economic growth—will most surely temper inflationary pressures and credit demand.”
Financial Rather Than Business Crisis
What the nation faces Is “a financial rather than a business crisis,” says Eldon A. Grimm, senior vice president of Walston & Co. This is evident, he explains, from the record interest rates, low bond prices, the inability of some state and local governments to sell bonds at current yields, and liquidity problems for some companies.
One analyst who thinks the market will be able to hold its recent gains is Lawrence Lewis, Pershing & Co. partner. He believes that investors are just beginning to fully recognize “the importance of the change in monetary policy.”
The Federal Reserve Board switched in mid-January to a more expansionary credit policy from its previous stringency. Its target for the year is believed to be an expansion in the money supply—currency and checking account deposits—at an annual rate of 3% to 4%.
However, John W. Schulz, Abraham &. Co. partner, thinks “it will be impossible for the Fed to keep the rate at less than 6% for the year.” He says “the near-crisis in the bond market recently occurred despite a higher-than-planned rate of money growth, which suggests that the reported policy goal of a reasonably steady 3% a year is unrealistic, and that future attempts to attain it for 1970 could risk recurrent and perhaps more severe crisis threats."
At the White House meeting last week Arthur F. Burns, Federal Reserve Board chairman, reportedly assured the businessmen that he would be willing to see the money supply expanded at temporarily excessive rates if this was necessary to provide enough liquidity to prevent an economic collapse resulting from a shortage of ready funds in banks and other financial institutions.
