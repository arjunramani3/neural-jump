Abstract
The Nasdaq Composite Index plummeted 43.30, or 3.9%, to 1060.19 in its worst point move since the October 1987 stockmarket crash and its ninth-biggest percentage drop ever. The Nasdaq Composite index is now down more than 15% from its June 5 high and closing in on a technical bear-market drop of 20%.
In the bond market, traders were only slightly more sanguine as prices lost some ground ahead of today's release of consumer price data and Thursday's congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Still, bonds failed to display the same resilience seen late last week, when prices rose amid the stock-market wreckage as asset allocators sold stocks and bought bonds. The dollar weakened, primarily due to worries about rising interest rates in Japan. But currency players also worried that the U.S. stock market woes could contribute to a foreign withdrawal of cash from U.S. markets, further depressing the dollar.
Traders said yesterday's decline stemmed primarily from the Nasdaq Composite's woes. Unable to hold 1100, the 200day moving average, the Nasdaq Composite sank steadily throughout the session, eventually finishing near its lows. At the same time, the Dow industrials began feeling the weight of the selling pressure emanating from the Nasdaq Stock Market. In one tumultuous hour in the midafternoon, the Dow industrials skidded nearly 100 points in a practical free-fall.

The Nasdaq Composite Index plummeted 43.30, or 3.9%, to 1060.19 in its worst point move since the October 1987 stockmarket crash and its ninth-biggest percentage drop ever. The Nasdaq Composite index is now down more than 15% from its June 5 high and closing in on a technical bear-market drop of 20%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 161.05, or 2.9%, to 5349.51 and is now down 7.4% from its high. That compares with a 9.7% slide by the blue-chip average in early 1994.
"These cycles are usually much uglier on the downside than people anticipate," said William Fleckenstein, the bearish president of Fleckenstein Capital in Seattle. "I don't think we're done yet, and things could get a lot more painful and vicious."
Traders scrambled to find interested buyers as a growing number of speculative investors fled the market, dumping out of previously highflying shares.
Despite the steep drops among many technology stocks and the widespread declines, trading action was surprisingly light. Traders said the reluctance of buyers to wade in and buy stocks contributed to lighter volume than is generally associated with steep drops in major indexes. One trader, remarking on the lack of confidence in stocks, said: "nobody wanted to be a hero" yesterday.
Volume on the Nasdaq was solid at 587 million shares, though well below the 694 million traded in last Thursday's drop. The New York Stock Exchange was trading a relatively modest 418.4 million shares, about 100 million shares shy of the volume reached last Thursday during the Dow industrial's 83.11-point decline.
"There's a lot of emotionalism and fear in the stock market right now, and the buyers are more uncertain about how aggressive they want to be," said Peter J. DaPuzzo, president of Cantor Fitgerald & Co., the equity trading and sales unit of Cantor Fitzgerald L.P. "Soon, investors will start to see good bargains as these prices drop, but we're not there yet."
In the bond market, traders were only slightly more sanguine as prices lost some ground ahead of today's release of consumer price data and Thursday's congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Still, bonds failed to display the same resilience seen late last week, when prices rose amid the stock-market wreckage as asset allocators sold stocks and bought bonds. The dollar weakened, primarily due to worries about rising interest rates in Japan. But currency players also worried that the U.S. stock market woes could contribute to a foreign withdrawal of cash from U.S. markets, further depressing the dollar.
Yesterday's weakness marked the second 100-point drop in the Dow industrials in just six sessions. Analysts said the streak of poor performances stem from surprisingly weak earnings -- especially among highflying technology firms such as Applied Materials -- which contributed heavily to yesterday's sell-off. Analysts added that long-term rates have hung at a none-too-helpful 7%, further rattling investors. Moreover, faltering intraday rallies are also eroding investor sentiment.
Adding to the foul mood on Wall Street, even seemingly upbeat news couldn't evade the Nasdaq steamroller. Cascade Communications, a computer network equipment concern, reported terrific earnings late last week and yesterday watched its stock fall 6 1/2, or 9.4%, to 62 1/2.
Traders said yesterday's decline stemmed primarily from the Nasdaq Composite's woes. Unable to hold 1100, the 200day moving average, the Nasdaq Composite sank steadily throughout the session, eventually finishing near its lows. At the same time, the Dow industrials began feeling the weight of the selling pressure emanating from the Nasdaq Stock Market. In one tumultuous hour in the midafternoon, the Dow industrials skidded nearly 100 points in a practical free-fall.
But more bullish investors waded in and tried to bring the industrials back higher. For a short time, the maneuver succeeded, with the average cutting its losses back below 100 points. But as quickly as the updraft began, it fizzled. Prices started falling and the industrials finished right near its lows for the day.

"We were not seeing a lot of people coming in, saying they wanted to get in and start bidding on some of these stocks," said David S. Lehmann, managing director and senior trader at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "And the problem is that the Nasdaq is really having a difficult time. The growth stocks in that market really led the way in this bull market during the past several months, and now they're leading the way down. People are really keying off the direction in the Nasdaq Composite right now."
Mutual fund companies also reported that public sentiment, while not buckling, is certainly displaying a great deal more caution than in previous weeks.
Dreyfus Corp., which manages about $80 billion in mutual fund assets, has seen investors switching from stock funds into money-market funds for the past several days, a spokeswoman said. Yesterday, there was "quite a bit of activity," along those lines, she said. Fidelity said it had modest redemptions during the past few days, while Putnam Investments and Strong Capital Management said they didn't see any surge in mutual-fund redemptions yesterday.
Indeed, investors did seem to be moving at least some of their money from stock funds to money-market funds last week. AMG Data Services reported a 1% increase in money-market assets for the week ended July 10, the most recent numbers available. Meanwhile, money dribbled into stock funds, with a 0.22% increase in assets, a significantly smaller increase than the week before, according to AMG.
The growing club of companies reporting weak second-quarter profits continued to grow. Applied Materials, a semiconductor equipment concern, reported weaker-than-expected numbers and fell to a new 52-week low on Nasdaq. Analysts said that Hewlett-Packard's broadly worded, downcast announcement last week about future profit growth problems continues to hang over the stock market, amplifying bad news like the Applied Materials announcement.
But even good news went unrewarded yesterday. NationsBank lost 1 to 79 1/4 after reporting strong second-quarter earnings. Also, more ominously, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and PainWebber both lost ground after reporting good earnings. Falling brokerage firm stocks generally indicate weakening market sentiment.
The heavy selling yesterday left few places to hide, with a wide array of indexes losing ground rapidly. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index skidded 16.39 to 629.80 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 8.17 to 338.67. On the Big Board, decliners pulverized advancers by more than 5-to-1, and the average share lost an eyepopping 90 cents.
Among small-capitalization stocks, the early summer's brief rally has -- in just a few weeks -- disintegrated into a nightmare. The Russell 2000 small-cap index lost 8.97 to 314.72 yesterday, and is now below its year-opening level. Among the most-watched technology measures, the Pacific Stock Exchange's technology index lost 7.93 to 182.18 and the Morgan Stanley high-technology 35-stock index fell 16.26 to 280.76.
Further addling investors is the growing confusion in the financial markets about the economy. In the bond market, traders continue to carp about low unemployment and the still-latent threat of inflation. These players anticipate that the Fed will increase short-term interest rates at the Aug. 20 policy-making committee meeting.
But at the same time, the spate of frail corporate profits reports has sparked all kinds of discussion about a looming recession in the stock market.
"The kind of thinking we're hearing about requires a sort of schizophrenic theory of how the economy is working," said David C. Munro, chief U.S. economist at High-Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. "It seems that for right now the bond-market and stock-market groups are following two different foxes through the same woods. That is creating plenty of uncertainty out there."
Despite the growing bearish sentiment, some bullish money managers say they have started moving in to pick up some of the falling angels. One trader said he was getting more proactive interest from buyers in International Business Machines. IBM lost 3 7/8 to 90 7/8 and is now down a whopping 29% from its high reached on Feb. 27.

"We're definitely still bullish, but the market is testing the stomachs of a lot of the more bullish investors out there," said Tim Morris, chief investment officer for domestic investments at Bessemer Trust in New York. "I don't believe the economic backdrop is sufficient to generate a real bear market right now, but we've been roaring along for six years and things don't go straight up forever."
Analysts hunting for some good news now point to a handful of bellwether earnings reports due out in the coming weeks. None appears more anticipated than Intel's. The chip maker will release its profit news today after the market closes, and traders and investors alike believe that the report could play a crucial role in the market's direction during the coming few days.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index was down 1.76 to 135.08.
In major market action:
Stock prices dropped. Volume totaled about 418.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 2,149 stocks declined and 440 advanced.
Bond prices declined. The 30-year benchmark Treasury bond lost about 1/2 point, or about $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 7.07%.
The dollar weakened. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5158 marks and 110.33 yen, compared with 1.5238 marks and 110.94 yen on Friday.
