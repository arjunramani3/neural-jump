‘Nifty’ Growth Stocks Finally Cracking, Signaling Market Bottom May Be Near
By Greg Ip And E.S. Browning
Staff Reporters of Tin-: Wau. Strkkt Journal How the mighty have fallen.
Until the stock market began to crack in July, it seemed large-capitalization "growth” stocks could do no wrong. As the rest of the market crumbled, Coca-Cola, Gillette, Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems hung close to their highs.
Those stock-market kings, known as growth stocks because they have higher-than-average expected earnings growth, have been ignominously dethroned during the selling of the past few weeks. Friday, Coke, the poster child of the "New Nifty Fifty," was down 28% from its 52-week high. Lucent 42%, Gillette 38% and Cisco 29%. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down only 15.4% from its July 17 closing high.
The damage was greatest Wednesday and Thursday. At Thursday's close, for example, the index of the 100 largest non-financial stocks on the Nasdaq Stock Market, which is dominated by Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, Dell Computer and MCI WorldCom, was off 23% from July 17. It snapped back 6% Friday, as the Dow industrials rallied 167.61 points, or 2.2%, to close at 7899.52, up 114.83 points on the week.
There has been some rough justice in the plunge. Many of the stocks that led the market up have led it down. Six of the 10 biggest contributors to the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index's 22% rise through its July 17 high were also among the 10 biggest contributors to its 19.2% plunge through Thursday, according to Salomon Smith Barney. Topping both lists: General Electric and Microsoft.
The New Nifty Fifty moniker echoes the Nifty Fifty of the early 1970s, a handful of

large-cap growth stocks driven up to dramatic price-to-earnings ratios. They were the last to fall, but ultimately fell furthest in the 1973-74 bear market.
Despite the latest drop, most of these new nifty stocks still trade at 30 or more times trailing operating earnings, compared to 22 times for the S&P 500, suggesting to some they could have further to go. But some see their fall as an important sign of a bottom approaching.
“you're seeing a break in the confidence about quality, and I still don't think we've seen much of a break in that regard,” says James Stack, president of newsletter publishers InvesTech Research.
Howard Kornbiue, senior portfolio manager at Pilgrim America Group in Phoenix, says, "Bear markets end when you have out-and-out giveaways on value,” and those stocks aren’t giveaways yet, he says.
Ned Riley, chief investment officer at
BankBoston, says he is seeing signs of capitulation among high fliers, mainly in the financial-services stocks, indeed, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange bank index was down 31% Friday from July 17 while the brokers index was down 47%. But some of the other high fliers still need to fall further before he will believe that the market has hit bottom.
"In a bear market, the outgoing tide usually takes all boats down to some extent," he says. "One of the prerequisites I of a bottom I is that the healthy companies would be dragged down along with the ones that have issued the warnings. And it would appear that this is what is happening right now. It suggests that maybe that is the capitulation phase of the market."
But the capitulation isn’t over yet, except maybe for financials, he explains. "There is another part of capitulation, when investors see no floor," he says, and Please Turn to Page C2, Column 3

‘Nifty’ Growth Stocks Finally Fall, Signaling a Bottom Could Be Near
ABREAST OF THE MARKET
Continued From Page Cl for the Microsofts and the Dells, that still hasn't happened yet.
Several factors explain why these stocks are under pressure. First, the spreading global economic crisis has undermined one of their primary sources of earnings growth, namely expanding overseas sales. Gillette and Coke, both of whose earnings grew 13% a year for the last three years, according to Baseline, have blamed weakness overseas in warning that third-quarter profit will fall short of analysts’ estimates. Lucent hasn't seen any serious profit estimate downgrades, but is vulnerable to a drop in global capital spending if recession spreads.
But investors have also dumped companies whose profit outlook has improved over the last six months, like Dell and Pfizer. Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block trading at PaineWebber, says the best-performing stocks are among the ones people sell when they need to raise cash to cover losses elsewhere. “Those are some of the bellwether stocks and if they want to raise some cash there is some liquidity there." Indeed, Dell and Pfizer are still up handsomely this year despite their recent drops.
However, there could be another, more worrisome, reason for these stocks’ fall: they may be undergoing a fundamental revaluation.
“People’s expectations for international staples are ridiculous under the new macroeconomic global conditions," says Robert Marcin, portfolio manager at Miller Anderson & Sherrerd. “Coke is a screaming buy if it grows 18% a year over the next five years," but it’s highly unlikely to achieve that pace given its singledigit revenue growth, he says. Should Coke come to be seen as an 8% to 10% grower rather than an 18% grower, it could be worth only 25 times earnings, compared with about 40 at present, he says.
He adds, "People realized a long time ago that Caterpillar, Case and Deere were capital-goods companies, but they haven't realized that these big technology companies have international exposure and are capital-goods companies. To the extent that international exposure is conceptually unappealing to investors, then they should be performing like other international capital-goods companies, like Boeing or Caterpillar."
Salomon Smith Barney strategists John MacNeil and Marshall Acuff said in a commentary Friday that while the nifty stocks have begun to capitulate, the process won't be complete “until analysts, portfolio managers, and other market participants adjust to expectations of slower economic and earnings growth for the balance of 1998 and 1999."
But unlike in the early 1970s, Mr. MacNeil and Mr. Acuff believe the nifty

stocks will retain their premium valuations, because bond yields are around 5% compared to 10% in 1972. When interest rates are lower, investors are willing to pay more for future earnings, boosting the premium for growth. The Salomon strategists calculate that in 1972, a stock with 10% growth was worth 27% more than one with 8%. growth. Now, they figure that premium is more like 80%.
Friday’s Market Activity
Large-cap stocks rallied on the strength of financial and technology issues and the bond market's continuing woes. But analysts said there's no way to discern whether Friday’s session marked a shortterm bounce off of oversold levels or the start of a sustainable move higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 167.61 points to 7899.52, extending a comeback from late Thursday that had erased all but 10 points of a 270-point fall. Advancing issues beat declining issues three to two on the New York Stock Exchange, and two to one on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Financial stocks were back in favor. Citigroup jumped 2 15/16 to 35 7/16, J.P. Morgan rallied 414 to 84%, American Express gained 4A» to 77, and Chase Manhattan rose 2 5/16 to 42 13/16. Some of the biggest technology names also performed impressively. Intel added 5 ’» to 83 13/16, Microsoft gained 5 11/16 to 96%, Cisco was up 3% to 50 1/16, Dell jumped 43» to 52 13/16, International Business Machines tacked on 3 13/16 to 127 5/16, and EMC rallied 4 13/16 to 50.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average, battered in recent weeks, rallied 84.52, or 3.6%, to 2429.52. Shares of AMR rose 4 1/16 to 51 3/16, HAL gained 1 11/16 to 60%, Delta Airlines rose 3 5/16 to 86, and US Airways jumped 7% to 47.
