Industrial Index Skids 26.99 Points to 834.79 Concern Over Soaring Price of Oil Is Cited
By Victor j. Hilleky
Concern over oil's skyrocketing price helped turn the stock market retreat into a rout over a wide front yesterday in moderately active trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average skidded 26.99 points to 834.79, its sharpest setback in more than six weeks.
“Last month it was worry about the availability of oil and this month it's worry about the incalculable effect of the high price of oil,” observed Leslie M. Pollack, senior vice president of Hayden Stone Inc. He cited a Wall Street Journal story that noted the adverse Impact that the rising petroleum price could have on the U.S. balance of payments and on the economies of Japan and Western European nations. A study prepared by the Secretariat of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reportedly estimates that the non-Communist world will have to pay an additional $50 billion this year to import its oil requirements.
In its pullback this week the industrial average has plunged more than 45 points. Sharp losses also were posted yesterday by the transportation and utility indicators.
Underscoring the broad sweep of the decline were the 1,314 New York Stock Exchange losers, more than five times the 246 gainers.
Oil and oil industry-related stocks were among the hardest hit in yesterday's selling. Brokers said there was profit taking in this group, which had been exceptionally strong in recent weeks. Other prominent casualties included gold stocks, which had shot up in recent sessions, reflecting the soaring price of gold abroad.
Lawrence Lewis, vice president of Pershing & Co., said the mutual funds traditionally nail down some capital gains early each year and their selling was in some of these groups that had been leaders in the market's year-end rise.
Big Board volume, heaviest during the morning, totaled 18,070,000 shares and almost equaled the prior day's 18,080,000-share turnover. Trades of 10,000 shares or more, an indication of institutional activity, fell to 107 from Tuesday’s revised total of 125.
Contributing to the market's weakness was the news on Tuesday that wholesale prices spurted again in December with a 2.2% seasonally adjusted gain. Another depressant was the indication that the Arabs and Israelis weren’t as near agreement on a separation of their forces along the Suez Canal as had previously been believed; Secretary of State Henry Kissinger this week will fly to Egypt and then to Israel.
On the oil front, President Nixon invited Western nations to a Washington meeting on the energy crisis Feb. 11.
Amex Index Skidded
Declines held almost a three-to-one lead over winners on the American Stock Exchange, and its index slipped 2.12 to 94.46. Turnover slowed to 3,130,000 shares from 3,530,000 the previous day. Also down was the National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter stocks; it slid 1.82 to 92.20.
Big Board stocks that sank to new 1973-74 lows increased to 56 from 38 on Tuesday and new highs fell to five from 39.
Among oils, Phillips Petroleum slid 6% to 61% in fifth place. Texaco, sixth most active, fell 1% to 28%, and Gulf Oil % to 23% in fourth place. Pennzoil, in seventh place, slipped 1% to 27. Tesoro Petroleum, eighth most active, declined 2’4 to 51 and Continental Oil, in ninth place, 4% to 49%. Also active, Mobil dropped 4 to 48% and Standard Oil of California, 2’4 to 32%. Exxon fell 3% to 92%.
Some other big oil losers were Standard Oil (Ohio), down 7 to 73%; Superior Oil, 11% to 274%; Atlantic Richfield, 6% to 102%; and Getty, 12% to 151%.
Dresser Industries, an oil-industry service company, slipped 5% to 60%. Foster Wheeler,
