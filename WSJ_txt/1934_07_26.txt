Discouraged by the market’s performance, particularly the descent of the railroad shares to new low ground, holders of stocks pressed their shares on the market yesterday, forcing the level of stock prices back to the lowest figure since late October. 1933, and lifting the trading volume up to 3.340,000 shares, the highest figure since the first week of February, 1933. Only brief interruptions occurred between the waves of selling, and the list closed near the day’s lows, with the Dow-Jones industrial average at 85.51, off 6.06 points. The rail average stood at 34.29, down 3.30 points.
Wire houses reported that selling was particularly insistent from interior centers, close to the area of the country afflicted by the drought. While the Austrian situation undoubtedly was responsible for some of the unsettlement in the American securities markets, foreigners were reported as buyers on balance as stock prices faded here.
Bonds were under severe pressure, too, with foreign issues heavy sufferers and railroad bonds the weakest in the domestic group. While grains closed lower, they showed stout resistance to pressure, losing only around l’s cents a bushel. Cotton was off about 25 cents a bale.
The Drought and the Canning Industry
While the drought in the Middle West will cut down this year’s food pack, canning companies like California Packing and Snider will be
in position to	sizable profits on their In-
ventories if food prices move upward. The uptrend has become pronounced in cities in the draught area already, and later on it seems logical to expect that it will spread to other sections of the country. Demand for canned goods should be high for the balance of the year, too, because vegetable gardens in a large section have been badly damaged or destroyed*
California Packing’s ‘inventories, at February 28, 1934, the close of its fiscal year, were carried at $14,065,880, against $10,988,991 at the end of the previous fiscal year, Snider, which does a much smaller business, had inventories of $1,187,545 at March 31, the close of its fiscal year, against $1,169,072 a year previous. Xn both cases, inventories were carried at the lower of cost or market.
From the can-making companies’ standpoint. reduced vegetable crops spell smaller earnings. The big season of demand fop cans for this year’s pack started this month, and will continue through October. It is too early to figure the size of this year’s pack, but the trade looks for a reduction from earlier estimates. The pea pack is known to have been sharply cut down, as result of the adverse weather.
A Sample of the Tax Burden .
The Rimmon* report for the first half year offered a sample of what the tax burden is doing to corporate profits, one important reason why buyers of stocks are so worried over the trend of profit margins. Simmons’ gross business in the first six months of the year was $12,316,321, an increase of just a little less than 20%. In contrast, all taxes, including the processing tax and the federal capital stock tax. amounted to $699,102 for the half year, against $273,039 in the comparable months of 1933, an increase of 1569c. The increase in taxes was the major reason why Simmons showed a larger loss in the first half of 1934 than in the similar period of 1933.
“Cash*’ Buying Dries L’p
Brokerage houses which had reported quite a fair amount of odd-lot buying for cash on Tuesday and Wednesday said that business faded away yesterday.
Ralls* Weakness Hurts List
Failure of the railroad shares to show any Important rallying power in the early part of
trading yesterday was one factor which depressed sentiment in the financial community, and brought new selling into the industrial*. In eleven out of the twelve sessions which had preceded yesterday’s heavy trading, the Dow-Jones railroad average had closed under the previous figure. The net decline in the rail average in the 12 sessions amounted to just a little less than 15%. After such a break, indications of some rallying power were looked for. but none appeared-
A Supply and Demand Market
In brokerage bouses yesterday, the lack of rallying power shown by the market whenever selling pressure lifted drew comments from the tape watchers. A variety of explanations were offered, with the absence of any concerted support for stocks the most logical. Big traders now are not supporting their favorities, as once was the case, and buying from other quarters, like bank affiliates, which once helped to bring about sharp rallies, is absent.

Higher Costs and the Utilities
The report of Consolidated Gas for the second quarter and the New York Telephone Co.’s statement for June were enough to demonstrate conclusively what higher costs arc doing to the utility companies. The financial community already had before it, in the General Motors and the General Electric reports, bow some of the major industrials have been affected.
June gross of New York Telephone was roughly $50,000 ahead of gross for the comparable month of 1933. Net operating income, on the other hand, was $184,000 below the comparable month of last year. The Consolidated Gas statement showed an even wider variation. Gioss was roughly $800,000, or less than 2r/c, under the comparable quarter of 1933,
while the balance for the common stock was down 39% from the second quarter of 1933.
