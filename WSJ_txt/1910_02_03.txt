FEATURES OF THE MARKET.
Wire houses contribute sales.	'
Under the influence of liquidation and bear pressure the market in the early afternoon declined xh.rply, aome of the industrial specialties breaking almoat violently. Toward* the end of the period the tradine became leaa active and a rally set in winch, however, lacked vigor and exerted practically no effect on sentiment
A feeling of the utmost depression prevailed in the com-miaaion houaea and atocka bought early In the day were thrown over. Not only was this the caae. but some of these who abandoned a position on the bull side, thinking the market had not nearly reached bottom, tried to make up their losaes by commitments on the short side.
| Such rnduatrial specialties as Utah Copper. Beet Sugar. Central Leather. American Locomotive and National Enameling, in which pools have been more or less active for some time broke badly, and were ax freely sold for short accoont as they had been bought for a long pull when selling at considerably higher levels.
Wire houses reported that their customers, who had up to the present disregarded advice to liquidate, have begun to send in selling orders quite freely.
A fair rally.
In the late afternoon the market rallied in an irregu-> lar sort of way. but the bears fought the advance and seemed in no wise discouraged by the half hearted recovery ' which stocks made after their severe break. The commis-1 sion houses were'full of customers but these were more
CLOSED ACTIVE ON RALLY.
Heavy liquidation and still heavier bear Helling resulted in a severe break, but prices rallied towards the end and shorts covered freely. Sales 1.GG3.112 shares.
A sharp and at times almost demoralized break oc-i curred in the price of stocks, and notwithstanding a mod-crate rally at the end, all the active issues shovred declines on the day, the losses running generally from two to six points. No concrete reason could be given for the heavy liquidation wmen was the primary cause of the break, except that bankers had called loans of speculators who had been carrying lines of stocks, and particularly of pool ta-mies. for a considerable time past in the expectation of ultimately selling them to the public at higher prices. Just why such calling of loans was resorted to is uncertain, for there was nothing in the day’s news which could be regarded as a pretext for it. It could not be argued that any change of the attitude of the Administration toward* the corporations, or towards Wall Street, afforder reason for apprehension, and there was nothing in foreign af. fairs, not even the war cloud in the Near East whies___________________________________________________________

1 The market more nearly approached demoralization i in the eariv part of the second hour than at any other ! rime in about two weeks, and under heavy and burned selling prices broke sharply to now low levels for the downward movement. United States Steel and Union Pacific were particularly weak features, and their .nfluence on , the side of dtcline m the general Lst was important, as it always is in tnc market.
; Steel fell to 79*4. a full po.nt under the low level | of the opening, and a deebne of nvarly sixteen points from I the h.gh of last year. The Street seemed to be of the I belief that the trade was :n bud shape, but those best : informed raid this was not so. although seasonable dull-i ness preva:Jed.
I On a considerable volume of selling, and in the ab-I sence of any real support. Southern Pacific fell to 124. ! a new low point for the decline, eliminating stop orders. I and forcing liquidation bv speculators who had bought at ! the end of 1909 on the expectation of an increase of the dividend.	w
The commission houses hod a considerable volume of business, and even at this stage of the decline many of their customers were embracing the bear side. Conserva* tive operators were inclined to do nothing, and some of ; them took the view that those who were now putting out short stock were ^selling into a bag”.
Copper issues weak.
After a period of pronounced weakness the market rallied towards the end of the second hour, but the rally was rather feeble, and failed cither to intimidate the bears into covering or to induce the few who were not committed io the market to take a bullish attitude.	'
The copper israes were all weak, and the street In general took a very pessimistic view of the conditions in this trade. It was argued that plans to effect a combination and reduce output had really never been very seriously considered.
The Hill stocks after a lower opening showed notable strength, and were about the only important issues whicn succeeded in maintaining themselves at a level above the low of two weeks ago.
Excellent action was displayed bv St. Paul, but the Street was in no humor to pay attention to theories that the bullish interview of William Rockefeller a week ago was intended as an intimation of some special benefit* to be conferred upon stockholders in the not distant future.	.
In banking quarters no credence was given to the rumor reflecting upon the standing of bond houses, and assurances were given in the highest quarters that any house having bonds of ascertainable value could borrow monev upon these to a reasonable extent.
Transaction* for foreign account reached a pretty large total and wore chieflv on the buying side. The foreigners bought at !ea«it 23.000 shares of stock on balance, or about as much as they had sold on Wednesday, when they became scared over the warlike situation in the Near East.
