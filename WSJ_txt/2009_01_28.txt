U.S. stocks rose Wednesday, led by banks such as Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of America on hints the Treasury Department would take "toxic" assets off the balance sheets of financial firms.
Stocks rallied early, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up by more than 200 points after the Federal Reserve's afternoon statement hinted it may buy longdated Treasury bonds and take other measures to keep rates down in credit markets.
The financial sector has led the stock market around by the nose since mid-September, when Lehman Brothers Holdings failed and the banking system went into crisis mode.
Wells Fargo surged $5, or 31%, to $21.19. The bank posted a $2.5 billion fourth-quarter loss, but investors were encouraged that it maintained its dividend.
Citigroup was the biggest gainer on the Dow, up 66 cents, or 19%, to 4.21; Bank of America rose 89 cents, or 14%, to 7.39. Fears about their solvency receded, though it is unclear whether Treasury's plan could dilute shareholders' stakes further.
U.S.-listed shares of British and Irish banks rallied as fears of nationalization for those institutions diminished. Barclays rose 1.21, or 23%, to 6.42; Lloyds Banking Group rose 2.51, or 66%, to 6.33; and Royal Bank of Scotland Group jumped 2, or 45%, to 6.42. As for the Irish, Allied Irish Banks rose 78 cents, or 22%, to 4.30.
U.S. Bancorp added 1.59, or 12%, to 15.29. Chief Executive Richard Davis said the bank doesn't need to raise capital.
Shares of student lenders rose in anticipation of a House vote on President Barack Obama's stimulus package, which includes a promise of government-payment subsidies more in line with the companies' funding costs. SLM, or Sallie Mae, rose 1.29, or 14%, to 10.73. Small-cap Nelnet rose 82 cents, or 6%, to 14.44.
Terra Industries added 1.21, or 6.2%, to 20.69. Terra rejected fellow fertilizer maker CF Industries Holdings' unsolicited takeover bid originally valued at $2.1 billion, saying it is not in the best interest of Terra shareholders. Both Terra and CF Industries -- up $2.83, or 6.1%, to $49.14 -- are off more than 60% from their peaks.
American depositary shares of Novartis fell 2.29, or 5.1%, to 42.96. The Swiss drug maker Wednesday said fourth-quarter earnings rose sharply, but the dollar's swings on the foreign-exchange market hurt sales growth.
Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq) surged 87 cents, or 22%, to 4.86. The maker of servers and software swung to a fiscal-second-quarter loss, but results topped Wall Street's low expectations.
The drumroll of layoffs from corporations continued.
Stanley Works rose 3.89, or 13%, to 34.85. The maker of tools and other hardware eked out a fourth-quarter profit, hurt by the costs of job cuts first announced in December. The industrial company expects shipments to drop by 10% to 12%.
General Motors rose seven cents, or 2.1%, to 3.42 after the auto giant suspended its "jobs bank" program, reclassifying 1,600 workers at idled plants being paid the majority of their full-time wages as laid off. The Treasury Department is reportedly asking GM and Chrysler, who have tapped emergency loans, to provide more detailed financial projections.
Starbucks (Nasdaq) rose 50 cents, or 5.5%, to 9.65. After the bell, the coffee-shop chain said it will cut 6,700 jobs in fiscal 2009 as first-quarter profit dropped.
Whether this is another bounce for financial stocks and the broad market or a definitive end to the crisis depends on details of the latest bank-rescue plan, and how it works in practice, market participants said.
"From everything I've seen, it's still in the rumor stage," said Sean Simko, head of fixed-income management at SEI Investments. "There hasn't been a real clear-cut strategy plan of how they'd go about doing it."
"You're not going to see [the market move in] a straight line up even if this does happen," Mr. Simko said. "Until there's a clear picture drawn of any kind of resolution, you're going to see this market stay choppy."
