In Friday's trading, everyone was a dog of the Dow.
With all 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components finishing in the red, credit losses from American International Group and higher costs for computer maker Dell combined with troubling growth and inflation data to sink the stock market.
AIG, which fell $3.29, or 7%, to $46.86, ended the week down 2.02, or 4.1%.
Other financials finishing lower were Citigroup, off 1.30, or 5%, to 23.71; American Express, down 4.8% to 42.30, and J.P. Morgan, down 4.2% to 40.65, all contributing to the Dow's 315.79-point drop.
"It's the lack of any good news. Can we get a break on just one of these numbers? Everything this week, we can't catch a break," said William Groeneveld, head trader at vFinance. "People are tired, and now they're just stepping back."
Weighing heavily on the Nasdaq Composite Index was Dell, which posted a 6% fourth-quarter earnings decline on higher costs, with company officials warnings that its near-term results could be hampered by "more conservative spending by its customers." Dell ended Friday down 97 cents, or 5%, to 19.90, and finished the week up 36 cents, or 1.8%.
Several other computer makers also finished lower, including Apple, down 3.8% to 125.02, and Hewlett-Packard, off 1.6% to 47.77.
Not all technology stocks fell Friday, as Novell (Nasdaq) tacked on 91 cents, or 14%, to 7.45. The Waltham, Mass., infrastructure software provider swung to a fiscal first-quarter profit and raised its 2008 revenue forecast.
A day after MF Global plunged 28% thanks to a $141.5 million loss to unauthorized trades in the booming wheat market, the futures brokerage slipped an additional 3.64, or 17%, to 17.55. Lehman Brothers downgraded the company to equal-weight from overweight, while UBS cut its rating to neutral from buy.
Earnings reports cast a positive light on several companies, including FTI Consulting, up 7.62, or 14%, to 63.50. The Baltimore consulting and litigation-support-services firm forecast 2008 earnings and revenue above Wall Street expectations.
In addition, CommScope increased 3.43, or 9%, to 41.88. The Hickory, N.C., coaxial-cable maker posted higher fourth-quarter earnings and revenue above analysts' forecasts.
Quarterly earnings weren't as good at Titanium Metals, off 4.20, or 17%, to 20.62. The Dallas company said its fourth-quarter net income declined 46%, with the company attributing the drop to lower gross margins due to higher commodity prices.
Dril-Quip lost 5.65, or 11%, to 46.78 after the Houston offshore drilling and production-equipment maker posted a fourth-quarter adjusted profit and a first-quarter earnings forecast below Wall Street expectations.
Dean Foods decreased 1.47, or 6%, to 21.52 after the Dallas dairy processor and distributor agreed to sell 17.8 million shares, and its chief executive said the company is about a year behind in its debt- cutting plan.
Hansen Natural slid 2.65, or 6%, to 41.50 on Nasdaq, after the Corona, Calif., energy-drink maker posted a lower fourth-quarter gross margin on higher costs.
