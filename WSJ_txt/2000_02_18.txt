Certainly the end-of-week sell-off was painful: it robbed 3% from the Nasdaq Composite index of big and small stocks and took 2.3% out of the Russell 2000 small-cap index. The Russell 2000 fell 12.74 to 545.68, and the Nasdaq composite, finishing at 4411.74, plunged 137.18.

Small stocks may have plunged with the rest of the market Friday, but they will start this week at fairly healthy levels.
Certainly the end-of-week sell-off was painful: it robbed 3% from the Nasdaq Composite index of big and small stocks and took 2.3% out of the Russell 2000 small-cap index. The Russell 2000 fell 12.74 to 545.68, and the Nasdaq composite, finishing at 4411.74, plunged 137.18.
For the week, the Russell 2000 managed a gain of 8.55, or 1.6%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 16.35, or 0.4%.
Moreover, last week was largely a good one for little shares. The Russell 2000 small-cap index, a former market trailer whose stocks have come into favor, closed at record levels twice during the week, while the Nasdaq Composite Index set one all-time high.
Big down days have been almost as common as big up days this year. Last week's trading pattern was hauntingly similar to that of the week before, when the small-cap and Nasdaq markets rallied for much of the week only to end things on a down note.
Given the early week strength of the small-cap and Nasdaq markets, traders and analysts said they weren't surprised to see a wave of profit-taking Friday, especially ahead of the three-day weekend. The U.S. markets were closed yesterday for Presidents Day.
The tumultuous day also was marked by a technical glitch on the Nasdaq Stock Market. A communications-line malfunction hindered the transmission of last-sale stock prices to some of the market's workstations, which forced a temporary halt in the dissemination of intra-day values for the Nasdaq Composite and other indexes. The problem was resolved before the market closed.
Several analysts said they expect to see the market rebound this week as investors revert to their longstanding pattern of buying the dips.
As often has been the case on down days, one set of stocks that managed to buck the market 's bad mood Friday were new ones. Taiwanese cable and Internet provider GigaMedia, which was priced at $27 Thursday, more than tripled in debut trading on the Nasdaq. As of 4 p.m. Friday, it was at $88.
Internet professional-services company Inforte, Chicago, rose strongly above its $32 offering price, moving to $72.9375. Even eSafetyworld, a Setauket, N.Y., equipment and disposable-garments company that priced at $7, rose to $7.44.
The larger technology sector was unable to fend off the weakness that pervaded the market . The small-cap market also was pressured by the weakness of financialservices stocks, the largest industry group in the Russell 2000 index. Overall, all eight Nasdaq industry indexes posted declines of at least 1%.
NeoMagic plummeted 3 15/16, or 37%, to 6 11/16. The Santa Clara, Calif., maker of memory and logic devices, reported fourth-quarter earnings that were down sharply from the year-earlier period but were in line with analysts' projections. The company said it expects to incur losses in all four quarters of 2000, and it plans to take restructuring charges in the first quarter. NeoMagic said as part of a restructuring, it is seeking a buyer for its DVD-electronics product line.
Steven Madden, a Long Island City, N.Y., footwear company, fell 2 15/16, or 18%, to 13 9/16. Steven Madden, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, is under investigation by federal officials for his connections to penny-stock firms. Wasserstein Perella lowered its rating on the company's stock to buy from strong buy.
New Plan Excel Realty Trust (New York Stock Exchange) tumbled 2 7/16, or 15%, to 13 7/16. The New York real-estate investment trust said its fourth-quarter funds from operations will fall short of analysts' projections, and it expects its fiscal 2000 results to fall below its 1999 results. CIBC World Markets and Robertson Stephens lowered their ratings.
Intelligroup fell 6 15/16, or 16%, to 36 9/16 after the Iselin, N.J., informationtechnology services provider posted a fourth-quarter operating loss of six cents a share, compared with its year-earlier 25 cent operating profit.
Student Loan (NYSE) slid 5 1/2 , or 12%, to 41 7/8 on news the Pittsford, N.Y., originator of student loans and Citigroup terminated discussions about Citigroup's proposal to buy the Student Loan shares it doesn't already own for $45 a share. Neither company gave a reason for the termination. Citigroup has an 80% stake in Student Loan.
