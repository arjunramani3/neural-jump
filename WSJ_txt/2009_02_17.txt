The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled to its bear-market low in a broad selloff, as investors worried about the global economy and the health of financial institutions fled to the safety of gold and Treasury bonds.
Following declines in Asia and in Europe, the Dow opened lower and then slid further, finishing down 297.81 points, or 3.8%, at 7552.60, just a hair's breadth above its Nov. 20 closing low of 7552.29. It hit an intraday low of 7551.01 less than a minute before Tuesday's close.
The declines sparked worries of an even bigger slide to come. "Some people think it's bullish that we've been near the lows a couple times and not broken through yet, but I
tend to think the other way," said Chip Hanlon, president of Delta Global Advisors in Huntington Beach, Calif. "The more times you test a low, the odds should go up that it's going to give way."
Just one of the Dow's 30 components finished higher. Wal-Mart Stores rose 3.7% after issuing a rosy outlook for the first quarter and the full year.
Bank of America, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and General Motors all fell more than 12%.
GM had a Tuesday deadline to submit recovery plans to the government as part of an agreement to receive billions of dollars in federal loans. Analysts and investors fear that GM may be facing an imminent bankruptcy filing if it can't find ways to cut its costs.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 4.6% to 789.17, less than 40 points above its Nov. 20 closing low of 752.44. All its sectors declined, led by a 9.5% decline in financials. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks fell 4.3%.
Decliners outnumbered advancers more than 10 to 1 at the New York Stock Exchange.
Gold, meanwhile, rose 2.7% to $967 a troy ounce, within sight of its record close of $1,003.20 last March. As Treasury prices rose, yields fell to their lowest levels since late January. The yield on the two-year note was at 0.875%.
Investors will be watching President Barack Obama's speech Wednesday about plans to help the housing market. Stocks bounced back the day after hitting their Nov. 20 lows on optimism about economic stimulus to come but since then, government announcements have failed to lead to a sustained rally. Stocks tried to rise Tuesday after the president signed the latest stimulus bill but quickly declined again.
The Dow is now down nearly 14% this year and 47% below its October 2007 record close.
Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati, estimated that the market could perhaps slide an additional 5% to 10% if it closes below its late-November lows. "We've told clients that there will eventually be a great buying opportunity in this market, but it's not time to be a hero yet," he added.
A decline in Japan's fourth-quarter and full-year GDP amid collapsing demand for its products sent Asian stocks lower and the decline continued in Europe after Moody's Investors Service warned of bank exposure to faltering Eastern European economies.
Fears of continued weakening of global demand sent most commodity prices lower. Crude-oil futures slid nearly 6.9% to $34.93 a barrel in New York. The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index fell 4.3%. In addition to being a safe haven investment, gold also benefited from buying by Russia's central bank.
