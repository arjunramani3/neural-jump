Stocks soared in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Gains in pivotal stocks ran from a point to almost a dozen points, and a number of Issues were up seven points or more. Trading volume was 4,300,000 shares,. against 1,300,000 shares Tuesday. Bond prices were firm all day,'and good gains were sprinkled throughout the list, with all classes ot bonds sharing the advance. Commodities spurted sharply, wheat gaining more than two cents a bushel and cotton closing up 53 a bale.	'
The market was strong from the start, with very big blocks of stock changing hands at higher prices. American Telephone opened up around "three points; "United Aircraft was up about two; "United States Steel common a little more than a point. The rails were unusually active and were distinctly the leaders at the opening. Atchison. Chesapeake & Ohio, Union Pacific," and New York Central all were taken In big blocks, at higher prices.
Only a brief period of hesitancy ensued after the opening, as profit-taking was absorbed, and then stocks moved forward again, with the pace of the advance accelerated. The pivotal industrials assumed the leadership, with Telephone, American can. Steel, and Allied Chemical in the van. Steel preferred had a sensational run-up. A thin market, existed at the start of the day, with the stock finally opening at 76, after several bid and asked prices had appeared on the tape. At that price, it was up more than 5 points. At the close, the stock was up about 10 points.
The Dow-Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, at the close, was at 75.16, an advance of 7.67 points on the day. The upswing amounted to 11.3%. It was the biggest advance in the industrial average since October 8, 1931, when the m rm .trial average rose 8.47 points to 105.79.
The How-Jones rail average was up 3.74 points, to 36.22, an upswing of 11.5%.
The stimulus for the advance in prices came largely from railroad news. Loadings of individual carriers, for the week ended September 17, were uniformly good, and indicated that the uptrend was continuing. In some cases, loadings for the latest week are only slightly under the total for the like 1931 week. Missouri Pacific loadings, for Instance, were down only about 12% from the similar week of 1931.
Electric output figures, recording a wider decline from the 1931 week than had been shown in the previous weekly statements, were Ignored marketwise. The utilities shared fully in the market advance, although gains were not as wide, in some cases, as in leading industrials.
Markets abroad were strong. In Loudon, mining and oil shares were features, while in Paris, the entire list worked higher.
sharply in December. The "management still feels that the road win cover its dividend requirements this year. The road hasa bank loan of 32,500,000, and there are hopes among the most optimistic that his can be pared down, or eliminated, by the year-end/
Stability In Bonds Encouraging
The greater stability in the "bond market recently, reflected by fluctuations in the various Dow-Jones averages in a narrow .range and inclining to the upside, has been regarded as definitely encouraging. The rally in bemds, as measured by the Dow-Jones average of 40 corporation issues, was concluded on August 23, and a recession set in.
The top of the bond market rise was reached just about two weeks before the highs of the upswing in the stock market. The Dow-Jones Industrial average reached 79.93, its best level of the upward movement, on September 7, while the rail average high was set September 3. ■ In many quarters, the reaction in the bond market was regarded as clearly foreshadowing a downturn in stock prices, and the suggestion was made that stocks be sold, awaiting a reaction.
The Dow-Jones average of 40 corporation issues, since September 16, has swung in a narrow range. On September 16, the average was at 80.78, oft about 2.50 points from the rally high. Tuesday, the average closed at 81. The highest grade bonds, throughout the reaction, showed far greater stability than they did during the period of declining prices in the late spring, when investor confidence was shaken. They were the first to turn up. In the past few days, the more speculative issues have shown the widest gains, with the average of 10 second-grade rails pushing forward.
American Radiator’s Heavy Purchases
Entry into the market for raw materials on a big scale by a company of the type of American Radiator is a distinctly important development. It is indicative of the management's views on the prospects for raw material prices over the near-term future. The company is in an excellent position to judge the outlook.
Radiator’s purchases included 50.000 tons of foundry pig iron. It also covered its copper requirements for 1933. Purchases Included substantial amounts of scrap iron, lumber and other materials, all for future delivery.

C. & O. Results For August Good
Results of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway for August, when the road reported net iilcome for the month equal to 30 cents a share on the common stock, illustrated very clearly the dynamic possibilities for an earnings comeback by the carriers. They show how great a proportion of an increase in gross revenues is carried through to net income, when operating expenses are under such close surveillance as they are at the present time.
Gross revenues of the C. & O. in July were $7,220,343, while August gross mounted to $8,345,858, an increase of $1,115,515. Surplus after charges for July was $1,217,183, against the August figure of $2,309,118. August surplus was up $1,001,935 over the July figure. In other words, the gain -in surplus after charges was within $25,000 of the advance in gross revenues.
For the eight months ended August, Chesapeake & Ohio reported net income equal to $1.50 a share on the common stock, or average monthly earnings equal to 20 cents a share on the common. To cover its current annual dividend rate of $2.50 monthly average net per share should be about 21 cents.
” So far, September traffic has held up well, and there are indications that net income for the month will be as good, or slightly better than that for August. For the nine months, therefore, Chesapeake & Ohio should show its dividend requirements for the period just about covered. Both October and November generally are excellent months, while earnings taper off
