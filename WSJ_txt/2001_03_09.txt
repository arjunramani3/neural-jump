The Dow industrials, whose 30 component stocks are selected by the editors of The Wall Street Journal, went through a face-lift on Nov. 1, 1999. Four strong new stocks, Microsoft, Intel, Home Depot, and SBC Communications, a dynamic Baby Bell, replaced four underachievers -- Chevron, Goodyear Tire, Sears Roebuck and Union Carbide (the last of which later was acquired by Dow Chemical). Microsoft and Intel, in fact, were the first two Nasdaq-traded stocks ever to become members of the industrial average.
That is a lot better than the four replacements have done. None is up since it joined the industrials and only one, Microsoft, is up so far this year. They initially flourished after joining the Dow industrials, and gave the average itself a New-Economy boost, but all four new stocks got hit during the tech-stock collapse. As of Friday's close, a calculation of the "old" Dow, done on a theoretical basis that assumes the four old stocks had been retained, would have been 10792.05, 147.43 points ahead of the actual Dow, which was at 10644.62.
As stocks rebounded strongly after the 1998 Russian-debt default, the Nasdaq pulled away. It rose more than 230% through March 10, 2000, or 10 times as much as the Big Board-traded stocks, which gained 23%. People began to wonder whether the Big Board was becoming archaic. But since then, the Nasdaq has fallen 59%, while the NYSE composite has managed to continue rising, putting in a modest gain of 4.9% (although it has given back some ground since this year began). The Nasdaq's advantage is all but gone.

Something very basic has changed about the way people buy stocks: They are kicking the tires and doing the math. All you have to do is look at the behavior of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Better yet, look at two different versions of that venerable market gauge.
The Dow industrials, whose 30 component stocks are selected by the editors of The Wall Street Journal, went through a face-lift on Nov. 1, 1999. Four strong new stocks, Microsoft, Intel, Home Depot, and SBC Communications, a dynamic Baby Bell, replaced four underachievers -- Chevron, Goodyear Tire, Sears Roebuck and Union Carbide (the last of which later was acquired by Dow Chemical). Microsoft and Intel, in fact, were the first two Nasdaq-traded stocks ever to become members of the industrial average.
What has happened since the switch isn't exactly what you would have expected: the four stocks of the future are doing worse than the four stocks of the past.
It isn't that the four old stocks have soared since leaving the industrial average. They haven't. But three of the four (all but Dow Chemical) are up so far this year. And two, Sears and Chevron, are up since being removed from the average.
That is a lot better than the four replacements have done. None is up since it joined the industrials and only one, Microsoft, is up so far this year. They initially flourished after joining the Dow industrials, and gave the average itself a New-Economy boost, but all four new stocks got hit during the tech-stock collapse. As of Friday's close, a calculation of the "old" Dow, done on a theoretical basis that assumes the four old stocks had been retained, would have been 10792.05, 147.43 points ahead of the actual Dow, which was at 10644.62.
That is what is happening across the stock market: The ugly ducklings are having their day. The point isn't that Sears has become a better company than Microsoft. The point is that something that had been ignored by investors for more than a year has become important again, perhaps lastingly: valuation. Sears, in other words, was merely better-priced than Microsoft.
Last week's stock market was another shattering example of investors putting this math to work. After posting a 5% gain for the first three days, the tech-loaded Nasdaq Composite Index crumbled under the weight of warnings about coming subpar performance from the likes of JDS Uniphase, Yahoo! and Intel. After a 5.35% drop on Friday -the first anniversary of the index's record close above 5000 -- the Nasdaq composite finished the week down 3.1%, at 2052.78, its lowest point since late 1998.
But the industrial average, which despite its New-Economy injection is still dominated by more-established industrial stocks, held up better. Down 1.97%, or 213.63 points, on Friday, the blue chips finished the week up 1.7%, or 178.31 points, at 10644.62.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which fell 2.48% on Friday, ended the week at 1233.42, down 19.25% from its record close and within a hair of a bear market, defined as a 20% drop from a high. The industrials, by comparison, still are just 9% off their record. Nasdaq's 59% pullback, of course, is a bear with a capital B.
Here is another way to approach the issue of investors' renewed interest in valuations: Consider what has been happening lately with the sometimes-overlooked New York Stock Exchange Composite Index.
In a striking example of the stock market's recent shift, the balance has greatly changed in the tortoise-hare race between the stocks traded on the NYSE and those traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Until 1998, the composite indexes of those two stock markets had tracked each other fairly closely for more than a decade. The Nasdaq stocks, which tend to be smaller, younger companies, had eked out a slightly larger gain.

Not long ago, people wanted to own stock in companies they thought would be world beaters. Price was secondary. Today that has inverted: Price, compared with future earnings prospects, is what matters, not the brightness of a company's long-term future.
"What you now have with the force of a baseball bat to the forehead is that you have to decide in some orderly way what a financial asset is worth and why," says J. Thomas Madden, chief investment officer at Pittsburgh mutual-fund group Federated Investors. That math, he notes, is something some investors had stopped doing. "And if the assumptions around which you build that calculation alter, the market is telling you that the value of the asset is going to go down," he adds.
The changes to the market's balance can be seen over and over. Stock analysts call it "reversion to the mean."
Home Depot's stock nearly tripled in value from October 1998 through December 1999. It has fallen 35% since then. Sears was down 59% from May 1998 through February 2000. It is up 55% since then.
Cyclical stocks, industrial companies whose performance rise and fall with the economy, lost 30% of their value from May 1999 through October 2000, based on the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index. Since then they are up 28%. Stocks of consumer-products companies, also once considered less exciting than tech stocks, fell 25% from April 1999 through March 2000, based on the Morgan Stanley Consumer Index. They are up 33% since.
The best-performing stocks in the Dow industrials over the past year have been Philip Morris, Boeing, United Technologies (a maker of elevators and airplane engines) and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing. The worst-performing have been Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, Intel and Microsoft.
Some investors say the keepers of the big indexes, notably the S&P 500 but also the Dow industrials, went too far toward hot new stocks.
"The idea of rebalancing the S&P 500, taking out wonderful, established companies that have been in existence for years and replacing them with young companies with almost no profits, trading at 15 times revenues, is pretty extreme," says Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at mutual-fund group Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. He also thinks Microsoft and Intel are too tied to the fading personal-computer industry, and shouldn't have been added to the Dow industrials.
Elliott Shurgin, vice president of index services at S&P, says the main goal in adjusting the makeup of the S&P 500 is to reflect the makeup of the market. At the end of January, the last date for which he has data, tech companies represented almost the same percentage of the S&P 500's market value as they did the market value of the large stocks in the broader market, he says.
Paul E. Steiger, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, says of the Journal editors' decisions on the average's makeup: "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is designed as a barometer of the market and the economy, not as a mutual fund, and it has fulfilled that role with great success for more than a century. The 30 stocks in it are intended, as a group, to reflect the market, not to outperform it. So I'm neither surprised nor troubled that some of the stocks added to the average have been outperformed by some of those removed from it. We continue to believe, even in hindsight, that the changes we made in 1999 made sense. As for possible future changes, we never speculate on those."
At some point, many money managers who have moved away from technology plan to return -- but, apparently, not yet.
"We aren't increasing our exposure to tech stocks again yet," says Mr. Madden of Federated. "The fog is too thick at this point. It is simply too hard to see what the timing of that turn might be."
Friday's Market Activity
Cisco Systems (Nasdaq), falling $2.19 to 20.63, reached a 52-week low. The networking-products maker said it would cut its work force by 3,000 to 5,000 regular employees.
Intel (Nasdaq) sank $3.81 to 29.44, after the chip maker warned that, for the third quarter in a row, its profit wouldn't meet Wall Street's projections.
Transportation issues faltered as well, with Roadway Express off 2.13 to 23.88, while J.B. Hunt Transport Services (Nasdaq) eased 94 cents to 15.88. The losses came after USFreightways (Nasdaq), a small-capitalization trucking concern, warned of profit weakness. The stock shed 3.81 to 30.38.
US Airways fell 3.03 to 34.35 and UAL eased 76 cents to 39.89, amid concerns that the merger of US Airways and UAL's United Airlines may not proceed.
Dallas-based i2 Technologies (Nasdaq) slid 1.94 to 19.50, falling to a 52-week low. The maker of supply-chain management software said it would buy RightWorks, a San Jose, Calif., maker of procurement program software, in a $114 million stock deal.
