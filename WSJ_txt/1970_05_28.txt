Abreast of the Market
Industrials Up 20.95; Rally Defies Profit Taking; Volume Rockets; Early Nixon Dinner News Cited
By Davxd McLean
After a sharp follow-through rally yesterday morning the stock market resisted midsession profit taking and then turned on the power to finish sharply higher in very heavy trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.95 points to 684.15. The strong performance followed Wednesday’s explosive 32.04 advance.
Turnover surged to 18,910,000 shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the highest volume since last Dec. 31 when 19,381,180 shares were traded. Volume Wednesday was 17.460,000 shares. The rally was broad: 1,211 issues scored gains; only 271 retreated.
The market's major stimulant was a flood of favorable statements in the morning about the economy and Federal Reserve Board monetary policy following Wednesday night’s dinner party for business leaders at the White House. President Nixon reportedly told the gathering he was confident the sagging economy would turn up during the second half.
The meeting also eased some concern about the course of the Cambodian campaign, according to many of the guests. And the mere fact that the President met with the businessmen helped bolster confidence, a broker said.	•
Heavy Buying Marks Opening
The market opened with a burst of buying in a carry-over from Wednesday’s big gain. The industrial average was up 18.41 after an hour of trading with 5,650,000 shares changing hands. It was the heaviest first-hour volume since Oct. 22, 1969.
The advance ebbed, however, with about seven points clipped off the rise in the industrial average m lightened trading. “It was largely profit taking,” one analyst said.
The pickup in buying began soon after Albert Gordon, chairman of Kidder, Peabody & Co., said the President had indicated at the White House dinner that he believed some sort of persuasive tactics might be necessary to combat wage and price increases “if current policies don’t bring results.” But Mr. Gordon said the President stressed that he plans to postpone such tactics as long as possible.
“It's a development that gives hope,” one analyst commented after the news that the Administration is considering a wage and price restraints approach. “It’s obvious inflation isn’t going to stop. Fiscal and monetary policy couldn’t do it alone. I think it’s good news,” he added.
A broker mentioned short covering (buying stock to replace borrowed shares sold earlier) as one factor that pushed prices up at the close. “There was quite a bit of short selling (selling of borrowed stock) in the morning,” he said.
Bargain hunting—particularly among the blue chips—by mutual funds also helped strengthen the rise, another analyst said. Prices Spurt on American Board
Prices advanced sharply on the American Stock Exchange in its heaviest trading of the year. Its index rose 0.40 to 20.36 on turnover of 6,820,000 shares, up from 5,890,000 Wednesday. Gains led advances by better than six-to-one.
Only one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average had a loss. Alcoa slipped % to 51%. Du Pont jumped 4 to 108%. American Brands, General Foods, General Motors, International Nickel, Johns-Manville, Westinghouse, and Standard Oil (New Jersey) all rising 2 or more.
The number of new lows tumbled to 77 from Wednesday’s 300. Three issues set 1970 highs, the same as on Wednesday.
Occidental Petroleum was the most active stock, edging up % to 17% on volume of 344,100. The company has announced it plans to buy up to a million of its own common shares
