Stocks broke on a wave of savage selling yesterday. President Eisenhow- i cr’s heart attack—and its political im- i plications—set off the sharpest wave of ( liquidation in over a quarter century’s trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow-Jones industrial average closed down 31.89, the widest^de- 1 cline in points since it dropped 38.3.1 on • October 28. 1929. in the great crash of ; that year. The railroad average was off ' 11.15, more than it had ever lost in a : single session before. The most this compilation had ever fallen previously was 10.91 on October 28, 1929.
Percentagewise, however, yesterday’s break in the industrial average has been equalled or exceeded a few times m the last 25 rears Yesterday’s decline in that calculation amounted to a little more than 6 5%. The one ot October 28. 1929, however, amounted to 12.8%. and the very next day, October 29. 1929, when trading volume amounted to 16 million shares, the largest in Exchange history, the decline In the industrials was 11 6% Two other big percentage declines in the same average came in May, 19-10. during the fall of France. On May 14 there was a break of 6 and on May 21 of 6 8%. Both, however, were of less than ten points; the average that month fluctuated between US and 114
Another pair of sharp one-dav declines took place in July. 1933. They came at the end ot a steep rise which followed the 1933 “bank holiday.” when banks all over the country had been closed to stop depositors from trying to withdraw their funds in fear of a spreading wave of bank failures. The industrial average then broke from 103.58 to 88.71 on two successive declines of 7.1% and 7 6%.
Volume Largest Since July 21. 11133
Volume ot trading on the Big Board yesterday also broke rerent records At 7,729.000 shares it was the largest since Julv 2t. 1933
Excited conditions in the biggest stoi K market of the countiv were natura'lj repeated on Ollier stock exchanges, including the American Stock Exchange in New York, where similarly w-ide declines took place.
Othei kinds of mnikcts responded too £mong commodities, grains rose sharply during the day. although thev lost a big r-”"' of tlielr advance near the close. The influence behind their rise was the thought that if the President's illness improved Democratic chances In the 1956 election, the probability of a return to high and rigid farm-price -supports would he heightened.
High grade bonds, led by U. S. Government obligations, lose on the theory that the Democrats might letmn to bond price-pegging policies. although these wei e halted in 1951. while Truman was still in office. This market also was influenced bv the ulen that any decline business activity would free for investment bonds large amounts of funds now invested loans to business
Brokets reported the selling was of countrywide proportions. However tliev added most of their orders were in idatively small lots, the preponderance being 100 to 300 shares A number of leading houses said the bulk of the selling came from individual holdeis rather than from institutions such as pension funds Indeed, some brokets noted that tiieie was some institutional buying tliioughoul the d.it Orders pieviously placed at pines under the market weie filled, and in addition fmlhet buying oiders at j rices under those rounded yesterday were placed.
The heavy selling gave the governors of the New York Stock Exchange an extremely busy day. The selling ordeis so gieatly overmatched buying .orders that many slocks could not be "opened" until the governors had collected enough buying orders to meet the sales They sought such orders from all kinds of souices, including institutions and officials of corporations. By 11 o'clock, when the Dow Jones averages aie usually calculated for the first time in each trading session, only 11 of the 30 stocks in the industrial compilation and only four of the 20 rails had sold. As a result, no average was figured out until noon—the first time this has happened as far as anyone can remember since hourly averages were first calculated
Tape Was Slow nt Sturt
The result ot these delays was that the ticker tape early in the session gave an appearance of extreme dullness, with tew stocks being" traded and practically no popular favorites showing up Finally big blocks began to appear one at a time as the govcrnois solved each problem in turn. There were many blocks ot 10.000 to 30,000 shares, with U. S. Steel, on a block of 75.000 shares at 55. off 7'h. the largest.

Veteran traders and biokers expressed the opinion that, considering the volume of transactions, the decline was an orderly one. They also telt that the declines were relatively moderate when measured against the enormous price advances that had taken place in the last two vents Tliex tailed attention tn the fact that the industrial average had closed last Fndav nt its highest level in history. As one remarked, the •'market could hardly have been in moie vulnciablp position to surprise bad news.”
Feu Calls by Brokers for “Margin”
Generally speaking there were few calls bv brokers on their customers for additional ••margin” to “sweeten up” accounts where buvers had borrowed pail of their purchase prices, and where the funds the customers’ had put up were insufficient to piotect the biokers fully against anv further price declines that might ocrut Manv houses teported they were issuing no such calls
in mid-afternoon, when the President's iloctors announced his < oiuhtion was promising. a tanlv active rally from the lows occurred At that time the ticker tape ran as much as four minutes late in reporting part transactions on the floor of the Exchange There was also another brief period earlv in the day when the tape ran behind but dunng most of the day it kept up with trading.
In spite of the rally, which took many stocks one to five points up from the lows, verx few stocks weie able to show gams for the day. The last half-houx was mai ked bv nervous and active trading, but there seemed to be enough buying to keep prices stead} at the paitial recoveries they had scored
