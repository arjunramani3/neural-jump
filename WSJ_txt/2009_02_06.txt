Stocks snapped a four-week losing streak Friday, fueled by expectations that the grim jobs report would hasten congressional approval of the economic stimulus package.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 217.52 points, or 2.7%, to 8280.59, and at its intraday high was up more than 3%. Twenty-nine of 30 components finished higher, and General Motors was down less than 1%. For the week, the blue chips rose 3.5%, the best performance in more than a month.
Bank of America led the gains, soaring 27% Friday after Chief Executive Ken Lewis said in a television interview that the bank doesn't expect to need more government funding. The shares had fallen to a nearly 25-year intraday low Thursday, before closing higher, amid worries that steep losses from its acquisition of Merrill Lynch would require more government intervention. Despite Friday's gains, Bank of America ended the week down 6.8%.
The S&P 500-stock index jumped 2.7% Friday to 868.60. Financials led the gains, rising 7.5%. It rose 5.2% for the week. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 2.9% to 1591.71, up 7.8% for the week, taking the technology-laden index into positive territory for the year.
"The enthusiasm came from the idea that [Washington] is getting its brain around the bank funding, and that the stimulus bill is moving forward," said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities.
Other banks surged Friday as well. Citigroup gained 11% and Wells Fargo gained 18%. Some smaller, regional banks gained even more ground. Regions Financial added 48%.
The stock market managed to rally despite data from the Labor Department that showed nonfarm payrolls down by 598,000 in January and an unemployment rate of 7.6%.
Treasury securities sold off as jobs data underscored the need for a massive economic stimulus. The benchmark 10-year Treasury fell, sending its yield up to 2.98%, its highest level since Nov. 26, 2008.
Oil futures fell 2.4% to $40.17.
