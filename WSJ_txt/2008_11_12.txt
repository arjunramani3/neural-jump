Stocks tumbled to within sight of their late-October lows amid new signs of weak consumer spending and possible changes in the government's plan to bail out troubled banks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 411.30 points, or 4.7%, at 8282.66, within 110 points of its 5 1/2-year closing low Oct. 27. Its fifth decline in six trading days left the blue-chip average down nearly 14% in that six-day period and off 11.2% so far this month.
Only one of the Dow's 30 components rose Wednesday. General Motors, which lost more than a third of its market value Monday and Tuesday, gained 5.5% after Democratic leaders in Congress said they would push legislation to bail out Detroit auto makers.
Oil futures fell 5.3%, to $56.16 a barrel, their lowest close since January 2007, down 17% this month.
The Nasdaq Composite index fell 5.2%, to 1499.21, just below its Oct. 27 low and its lowest close since May 2003, on concerns about tech spending. Two days after Circuit City Stores filed for bankruptcy protection, electronics retailer Best Buy lowered its outlook for 2009. Its shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 8%.
After the market close, Intel, a Nasdaq company that is a Dow component, said its fourth-quarter revenue will be lower than expected, hurt by poor demand.
Morning losses Wednesday deepened after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson signaled that rather than buying troubled assets from banks, the government may use bailout funds to inject capital into banks and other companies.
Hedge funds contributed to the declines, particularly late in the day, as fund managers sold stocks to boost their cash in anticipation of a mid-month deadline for investors in many funds to put in withdrawal requests.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended down 5.2% at 852.30, just four points above its Oct. 27 low.
In a sign of investor jitters, short-term Treasury prices climbed and yields fell.
