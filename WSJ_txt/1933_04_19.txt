Complete tabulation of the Dotr-Jones etoefc averages, wUn charts, second from last parze.		
almost daily, and soared in yesterday’s turbulent market, Telephone and the utility stocks generally, the railroad shares and a few others, have been heavy.
Heaviness in Telephone was perfectly logical, in view of the first quarter’s earnings report and the threat of a dividend reduction. As far as utilities go, they have been depressed by reduced earnings, and investigation proposals in both New York and Illinois. Foor March earnings have been responsible* in part at least, for the sluggishness in the carrier shares.

High and Low Prices
Wednesday, on the New York Stock Fy.
Yesterday’s sweeping advance in industrial stocks sent the Dow-Jones average up to 68.31 at the close, penetrating by a fraction of a point the high of the trading area which has prevailed since October 10. That top was made on November 12. At yesterday’s close, the industrial average was at the highest point since October 4. 1932.
The rail average finished at 27.59, still about 3 points under the trading urea top of 30.61 set also on November 12, 1932. The rails were laggards on the advance yesterday, as they have been since inflation talk started to be a factor in the rise of the markets.
While penetration of the previous high of the trading area by the industrials certainly is cheering to the bulls, under the Dow theory penetration of a previous high by one average must be confirmed by the other before the movement takes on really important significance. In addition, the industrial average is only fractionally through tne trading area top, and students of the Dow theory are more satisfied by a movement which carries the average a full point above a previous resistance level.
One Dividend Resumption
Safety Car Heating & Lighting directors on Wednesday declared a dividend of SI, resuming payments on the stock. The last previous dividend was Si on July 1, 1931. The declaration attracted unusual attention, for the company is the first in a long time to resume payments, after suspending them.
A Silver favorite
Cerro de Pasco opened yesterday at 15, and was one of the active trading stocks throughout the day. The dynamic uprush in silver prices, due to Washington news, was of course the prime factor in the rise of the stock to a new high for the year, and the rise in the metal. At yesterday’s opening, Cerro was up 4% from Tuesday’s initial transaction, an appreciation of just about 40$;,.
Cerro is one of the copper and silver mining companies which has only one issue of stock. There are 1,12*2,846 shares of capital stock outstanding, and the last balance sheet, that for December 31, 1931, showed net current assets equal to about $14 a share on the stock. Cerro showed a loss of about S3.000.000 in 1931. and the 1932 report is likely to show a similar loss. Cerro’s mam properties are in Feru, and it is both a copper and a Silver producer.
The prospect of higher prices for silver has brought a marked pick-up in output both in this country and in Canada, and if that advance continues it may prove something of a fly in the silver ointment. In March, silver production in the United States was pushed up to 2.574,000 fine ounce®, against l.‘603,000 in February and 1.9GO.OOO in January. In Canada, silver output in March was moved up to 1,285.000 fine ounces, a little more than 25% above output in the four preceding months, but substantially below monthly production from July through October, 1932.
Off Gold Again
Decision of the Administration to control gold exports puts the country, technically at least, off a gold basis again. The President, according to reliable information from Washington, is going to ask wide powers over the handling the currency of the country. Apparently. the Administration is embarking on what for this country are uncharted monetary seas, and certainly no one now can predict what the outcome will be.
Unquestionably, the move to control gold exports was a preliminary to the conferences to be held in Washington. It puts this country, perhaps, in a more important bargaining position. If continued long, however, it might well mean a further deflation in world commodity prices, just as occurred after England abandoned gold in the fall of 1931.
The whole situation is now in a purely tentative state. It may change with startling rapidity, and such a change might occur as result of the forthcoming economic conferences. If agreements on world monetary and tariff matters could be reached at these conferences, and the President has stressed the possibility of arriving at such agreements, it is quite conceivable that plans for what now looks like outright inflation in this country might be shifted to world reflation of a much more moderate nature than anything now firing speculative imagination.
change, 270 stocks made new highs and 21 stocks made new lows, for the year 1933.
A Selective Market
The market, since it reopened on March 15 has been an extraordinarily selective affair, and has clearly portrayed the Influence that inflation talk has played in the movement of stock prices. Many of the highest grade stocks, long icgarded as the soundest and most conservative investment mediums, either have declined or shared in the rise to only a very minor extent. Commodity stocks, on the other hand, have been s^nRationul performers, pushing steadily upward.
All the talk about inflation has beclouded many of the important fundamental reasons for upward movements in prices for various groups of stocks. For instance, the sugars have responded in large measure to the advance in prices for raw sugar, which has a sound basis in the Improved statistical position of the industry. The advance in the shares of farm implement and mail order house companies reflects, as it always has before, the upward movement in wheat. No one can deny that the prospects of an abnormally short winter wheat crop Is a basic reason for an upswing in wheat. As for the steels, they naturally have moved up sis operations have forged ahead. The silver shares have shown the biggest response to the Inflation talk.
