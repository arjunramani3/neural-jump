STOCKS SLUMPED on Truman’s victory in the presidential race and restoration of Democratic control of Congress. Heavy selling orders, which accumulated before the opening, made it necessary for Exchange governors to go on the floor in an attempt to bring potential buyers and sellers together in leading shares. Pivotal steels, motors, oils and rails broke two to seven points in the early rush of liquidation. In many instances, delays of one to three hours occurred before the initial transactions took place. While a slightly firmer tone developed in the afternoon, the Dow-Jones industrials closed at 1S2.46, off 7.30 points. This was their severest plunge since September 3. 1946. • The rail average receded 3.45 points to 5S.52. Volume expanded to 3.230,000 shares, the largest since last May 14. While commodity markets were irregular. wheat and corn prices at Chicago advanced as much as 2a4 cents a bushel on the outlook for continuation of Democratic farm price support policies.
Voters displayed more conservative ideas about spending by their local governments than in any election of recent years. Of the nearly Sl-5 billion veterans* benefit and local improvement proposals for which more than fragmentary returns were available last night. $380 million had been rejected; $4o0 million appeared in danger of defeat and ,$6o0 million either had been approved or had a good chance of winning. Most of the veterans’ bonus plans that w ere turned down were linked with new and unpalatable taxes to cover the costs. On the losing side were veterans' benefit programs of $200 million in "Wisconsin, $65 million in Nebraska, and $42 million in Oregon.
TRUMAN* WON* the presidential election; pledged “peace and prosperity.’’
His victory was official at 11:15 a.m. (E.S.T.) yesterday w’hcn Gov. Dewey, the Republican candidate, conceded the election. The president pledged he would give all his efforts to “the cause of peace in the world and prosperity and happiness of our people.” Dewey, in congratulating the winner, called on the American people to unite behind “every effort to keep our nation strong and free and establish peace in the world ”
Almost complete returns last night showed the president had won or was leading in 28 states with 304 electoral votes; only 266 were necessary for election. Dewey was ahead in 16 states with 189 electoral votes. Gov. J. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the Dixiecrat candidate, led in four states with 38 votes. Henry Wallace, the Progressive Party nominee. failed to win a single state.
Truman's victory was generally considered the biggest upset in American political history. The election itself was the closest since 'Woodraw Wilson de* feated Charles Evans Hughes in 3916.
Tho total vote apparently failed to reach the 1940 record of nearly 50 million, as many had expected. Returns from S7% of the nation’s polling places last night gave Truman 22 million votes Dewey 20.2 million and Wallace one million.
Dewey said flatly he would not run a third time for the presidency. He added that he has no plans to seek a third term as New York’s governor, but denied reports that he would resign before his present gubernatorial term ends December 31, 1950.

Senator George of Georgia, slated to head the Senate finance Committee under Democratic control of the next Congress, said there was little chance of any tax reduction during the 19491950 'fiscal year because of increased demands on the government budget for national defense and other requirements. “Veterans’ legislation, which comes under the finance Committee, will get close attention.” Mr. George added.

South African import controls, to be proclaimed shortly, are expected to prohibit shipments of luxury goods from- the U. S. and to limit Jmports of other American products to o07 of the 1947 volume. The new regulations will be retroactive to July 1. This means that all orders by South African importers for American goods placed since that date will come under the revised quotas. Even more drastic import restrictions may be imposed later to stop the drain on South Africa’s dollar and gold reserves.
