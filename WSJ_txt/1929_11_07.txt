SHARP RALLY
AFTER BREAK
Pronounced Price Uptrend as Huge Volume of Investment Buying- Appears
CASH BUYING IS LARGE
After one of the most violent price breaks yet seen in the current stock market depression, with huge mint! transactions at prices 5 to 15 points below tbe previous closing, the market righted itself and staged a substantial rally m which the whole list participated.
Numerous factors were assigned as bringing tbe about-lace :n the market following what, many termed “a bottom opening.”
Doubtless one of the most potent factors was the unusual amount of buying which came into the market from big corporations and rich individuals. Some brokers with long and • wide experience in the Street said they never, recalled such h >ge buying put in and under tbe market at any one time.
Strength was lent to this development bv the nature of buying being of investment character and largely for cash. This would be of distinct difference from ••support' buying by banking interests for stabilization purposes, which usually is sold out on slight rallies. Important quarters seeing the character nf the buying noted the distinction. pointing out such purchases were not the typo to be dumped out again in the near future.	’
Important Neu*. Dc\ rlopmcnt*
Vigorous upturn in stocks doubtless foreshadowed some of th* important news developments which came after the close of the short session at 1 p m.
Definite announcement that shareholders of tbe National City Bank had refused tn ratify the proposed absorption of the Corn Exchange Bank Trust Co relieved a doubt which had been overhanging the market, and there was a pronounced improvement in sentimenet Tbe plan provided for an exchange of four City Bank shares for each five of Corn Exchange, with stockholders of the later institution to be given the alternative of accepting a cash offer of $360 a share for their stock from the National City Co. Decline in th** open market price of Corn Exchange shares to around 3200 naturally cast doubt upon the prospects of the National City shareholders approving a plan whereby the City Co. would pay cash for the Corn Exchange shares at a price of more than .50% above the open market value. Unsettled feeling in market circles was plainly (relieved when the/ decision of the National City stockholders became known.
Big Drop in Loans

a 5656.000.000 reduction, in brokers’ loans the past week, bringing; the total drop in collateral borro^nE-* brokers to $1,752,000,000 in two weeks. Total decline from peak on October 2 ti&s been nearly $2,000,000,000. or 23r»
Recalling the statement some ten days ago by the elder Rockefeller that he and his son had been and would continue to buy sound common stocks, the Street regarded much of the buying during the day as coming from that source. It way considered as not being without some significance that four Standard Oil units. Standard of California. Vacuum Oil. Ohio Oil and Standard of Nebraska, had declared extra dividends in the past week. Certain it is that the movement for real conservation in oil has made greater progress the past fortnight than any tune previously, greatly strengthening the industry’s position.
Street Encouraged
The sharp change m price trend gave the Street a great deal of encouragement Comment and feeling was general that necessitous liquidation has been finished, or at worst nearly finished. It was hoped that a more orderly market would develop out of the situation.
The rally in prices started before the market had been going three-quarters of an hour. "’l’h Steel common leading the upswing from a low of 162 to 175. Other price changes were just as marked as the trading progressed, with a heavy
turnover.	k	.
The first half hour was one of the larges, ever recorded for that period m Stock Exchange history with 2.400 000 shares changing hands, more than double the business in the same period ot Wednesday and 400.000 shares more than the bit opening half him- Monday Total volume was 7.172 700 shares compared with 5 "14 < OO or.

The bank stock market was erratic in th earlv trading but later these descriptions improved and a number of them showed gains over the previous closing. National City Ban up 35 points at noon. Chase Bank gamed 1-. Com Exchange was ten points better.
Opening Prices Lowest
The opening was probably one of the weakest the market had witnessed. Key stocks all through the list sold down to levels well below the bottom prices made during the heavy ®cs-sions of liquidation the past two weeks. Steel was one of these: General Electric another Telephone got to a new low. A. number nt stocks While lower did not get to the prices touched on Tuesday of last week but for a time any significance which might be attached to this was overshadowed by the big blocks and overnight declines.
That there was an enormous amount ot buying under the market was apparent soon after the opening deluge had been taken care of in most instances opening prices were the lows for the session, indicating that forced, frightened. short and other kinds of selling had been absorbed bv the tremendous opening volume From these levels the recovery was marked and well sustained to the rest of the day.
With such a huge turnover it was only natural that the tape would get behind quoting prices, it being 1" minutes late before 10:30 and more than an hour late toward the close. It was still printing U. S. Steel common at around 165 when the Dow-Jones tickers flashed to the Street that it was 173 bld on the floor.
