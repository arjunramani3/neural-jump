In rising 368.05 points to 8603.86, the Dow industrials regained only about one-fourth of the previous week's losses, of 1,369.70 points. The rebound nevertheless was a relief for an investment community rattled by last week's selloff, which saw the industrials plunge 14.26% on fears of war and a recession.
Overall, the market value of U.S. stocks yesterday rose 3.8%, or $388.8 billion, to $10.62 trillion. That is based on the stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index, which includes about 7,200 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company based in the U.S. Overall, however, the index's value remains down 37%, or $6.34 trillion, from its high of $16.96 trillion on March 24, 2000.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 3.19%, or 3.41 points, to 110.40.

In what could be a sign of volatile times ahead, stocks rebounded for the first time after suffering heavy losses in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 4.47%.
It was the blue-chip index's strongest advance in 11/2 years. But whether the gains were just a reflex, or the start of a lasting recovery, was the subject of continuing debate on Wall Street.
In rising 368.05 points to 8603.86, the Dow industrials regained only about one-fourth of the previous week's losses, of 1,369.70 points. The rebound nevertheless was a relief for an investment community rattled by last week's selloff, which saw the industrials plunge 14.26% on fears of war and a recession.
Professional investors were reassured yesterday to see the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose 3.90%, or 37.65 points, back above the 1000 mark, at 1003.45.
The Dow industrials' gains leave the index still 10.43% off the level of 9605.51 of Sept. 10, the day before the attack, but well above its close of 8235.81 on Friday. Since the attacks, some of the smokestack stocks in the industrials have been hard hit by worries that an economic recovery will be delayed and that the world could sink into recession.
"We expect the stock market to remain very volatile [both on the upside as well as on the downside] for the remainder of the year," Ronald W. Roge, president of investment advisory firm R. W. Roge & Co. in Bohemia, N.Y., told clients in a report. "We will have rallies and then a retest of the market lows." Over the longer term, Mr. Roge said stocks are likely to show clear gains from their current levels.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, which is dominated by technology stocks, also had a strong day -- up 76.21 points, or 5.35%, to 1499.40 -- although not among its strongest days of recent years because its tech stocks have been much more volatile than the industrials, putting in sharper gains in the past.
Bonds and the dollar were mixed, following drops in Treasury bonds last week.
Many investors had been reluctant to buy stocks on Friday, fearing some kind of renewed terrorist threat over the weekend. When nothing happened, that helped calm fears. Short sellers, who borrow stock and sell it in a bet that stocks will fall, were actively shorting a wide variety of stocks last week, notably airline and insurance stocks. They hurried to cover their positions by buying stock, and that helped to spur the rally, with airlines among the big gainers.
Since so-called short covering is a temporary phenomenon, some analysts questioned how long the rally would last. The point gain by the Dow industrials, for example, was the biggest since the blue-chip average gained 399.10 on April 18 of this year. After that gain, however, the index resumed its decline.
Baltimore mutual-fund firm T. Rowe Price is "still seeing a fair amount of redemption or exchange activity out of stock funds," spokesman Steve Norwitz said. The company's phone representatives said about half the redemption activity seems "normal," while the other half seems to stem from market jitters, Mr. Norwitz said.
But overall, Mr. Norwitz said, his indications are that most of the selling and buying still is being done by large institutions, rather than by individuals. He said the move out of stocks by mutual-fund investors has been less pronounced than during other market crises in the past. "The cash flows haven't been that significant as a percentage of assets -- nowhere near the kind of levels we reached in 1987," he said. While the mutual-fund industry saw stock outflows between 2.5% and 3% in the first week after the 1987 crash, outflows last week were "much less than 1%," Mr. Norwitz said.
Many traders doubted that a lasting recovery has begun yet.
"My feeling is that it is just a bounce," said stock trader Rob Cohen of Credit Suisse First Boston. "I don't think that we have reversed the overall trend and my feeling is that as we work through earnings preannouncement season there will be a lot of concerns about earnings going forward. We could reverse this tomorrow. There still is a lot of uncertainty about the situation in the Middle East and until that uncertainty is removed I think markets will be jittery as well."
One indication of those jitters came after the end of regular trading hours, as AOL Time Warner warned that its earnings for the current quarter and for the year would miss expectations. The shares were up $2.65 to $32.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, but fell to $31.13 in after-hours trading.

But during regular trading hours, at least, the bulls again were in charge. Goldman Sachs stock strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, a longtime bull, became even more bullish, urging clients to raise their stockholdings to 75% of their overall investments, from 70%. Formerly bearish strategist Thomas McManus of Banc of America Securities also raised his recommended level of stockholdings, to 70% from 65%.
A sharp drop in oil prices also helped spark the rally.
"A lot of positive trends converged today to drive the market higher," said Stephen Carl, head of U.S. stock trading at New York brokerage firm Williams Capital Group. "Foreign markets, with the exception of Japan, reported gains, analysts voiced optimism on the insurance and energy sectors, and short sellers had to cover their positions. What's really remarkable is that the rally seems to be sustaining itself."
The Dow industrials still are 27% off their record close of 11722.98, set Jan. 14 of last year. The Nasdaq composite still is 70% down from its record close of 5048.62, set on March 10, 2000, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is 34% off its record close of 1527.46, on March 24, 2000.
The Dow industrials still are trading back where they were on March 10, 1998, while the Nasdaq index has lost all its gains since July 11, 1997, and the S&P 500 is back to its level of Feb. 3, 1998.
Overall, the market value of U.S. stocks yesterday rose 3.8%, or $388.8 billion, to $10.62 trillion. That is based on the stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index, which includes about 7,200 companies, or nearly every publicly traded company based in the U.S. Overall, however, the index's value remains down 37%, or $6.34 trillion, from its high of $16.96 trillion on March 24, 2000.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 3.19%, or 3.41 points, to 110.40.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks advanced. On the Big Board, where 1.74 billion shares traded, 2,412 stocks rose and 807 fell.
Bonds were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, or $1.88 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to 4.712%. The 30-year bond was up 8/32 to yield 5.575%.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 117.57 yen, up from 116.65, while the euro rose against the dollar to 91.63 cents from 91.37.
