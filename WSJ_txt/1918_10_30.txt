THE STOCK MARKET
HEAVY .LIQUIDATION
Calling of loans and forced selling of collateral continues under guidance of Money Committee—Steel common off six points following reduction of extra dividend— Ollier adverse factors—Stocks believed to be going into strong hands.
Sales, 971.IKE) shares.
Liquidation of an urgent character was renewed, and the lowest prices of a fortnight resulted. A number of causes contributed to the market’s decline. Tho principal cause for selling, as pointed out repeatedly in this column, was found in the calling of loans to meet requirements of the Monej* Committee. Not all houses were called upon to liquidate accounts. It was understood that only those houses whose loans were out of proportion to capital invested were molested, most ot tne seu-, ing was in the industrials, the rails holding up compari-lively well.
In the case of Steel common the reduction of the extra quarterly dividend from 3% to 2% served as the main I reason for the flood of selling. So far as is known there | were no top-heavy accounts in Steel common in any of the I houses which have been singled out by the Money Committee for over-extending credit. Steel common lost six points. Sympathetic selling in other issues was natural. Lt is rather unfortunate that tlie wholesale calling of loans . by banks came simultaneously with the reduction in the j Steel dividend .	i
As a matter of fact, rar-seeing investors looked for 1 a long time for a reduction in the Steel dividend. If the stock had been selling at 150 the action of the Steel directors would undoubtedly have caused alarm. At 103, however, Steel seems to have discounted a reduction of tlie rate from 17% to 13%. Steel yields over 12V£% at current levels and this is not apt to be overlooked by the investment public^ The regular rate could have been continued without impairing in the least the credit of the Steel Corporation. In nine months the corporation earned about 519 and paid out less than $12.
Tlie readjustment forced by tlie cleaning up of topheavy accounts does not appear to bo over hut in th<* opinion of prominent men in the Strart it should have run it! course in a few day*. Stocks have been absorbed in a remarkable manner and the impression is general that they have gon** into strong hands.
Three Depressing Influences
Restriction of loans by the Money Committee, reduction of the Stool dividend, nnd official announcement of an investigation by the Exchange authorities of transactions in Mexican Petroleum, liad a depressing influence on the stock market at the opening. Good news contained in tho Austrian note was apparently overlooked.
Bethlehem B Reflects Contract Cancellation
Bethlehem B, responding to the Washington report tl.at a $60,000,000 ship contract taken by one-of the subsidiaries cf the Bethlehem Steel Corporation had been carcellecl, sold off 1 Vi to 68%. Marine preferred opened off a point at IIS and then sold up to 119M. There wer*» recoveries all through the list at the end of the flrrt fif* teen minutes.
Rails in Favor ns Peace Issues
Ralls acted best on the list. Southern Pacific was leader, with a gain of about a point at 102%. A dost* distinction was mole in the first half hour between the war and peace stocks, and rails were apparently favored in the peace group. Coppers were steady.
War Shares Decline
The war shares suffered badly, probably in reflection of the cancellation of a big contract held by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. It is worthy of note that some corporations have cancellation clauses in their Government contracts, while others have not. Industrial Alcohol was singled out for attack and sold off 2% points to 102. Bethlehem B continued weak. Distillers was a soft spot. American Sumatra, which is regarded by some as a war stock, sold off J Va to 104%. American Steel Foundries sold off 2 Vj to 88 in one sale.
International Mercantile Marine Plans
Good buying appeared in Marine pfd. and, after an early loss, the stock advanced %to 119%- It can be stuted that the Marino plan is practically ready for submission to a vote to stockholders. A special meeting will be necessary. Stockholders must first vote on the question of selling assets of the company and a majority vote is required to put through this step in the program. The next step is liquidation of assets and this will require a two-thirds vote. There is a probable chance of a slip-up by virtue of the fact that some of the common stockholders are opposed to liquidation. It is understood, however, that important stockholdings are already pledged to the plan of liquidation.
Special Weakness in Steels
The steels suffered badly. Steel common broke through 105 for a net loss of 3*4. Republic Steel common, which has never paid extras and which is earning more than

Steel common, sold off 3% to 80%. Gulf States Steel made a recent low at 68%. The Government is forcing the Gulf States Steel Co. to make certain grades of hard steel at a loss on every ton produ.-cd. The unfairness of this has been pointed out to tho Government officials, but there has been no redress. It is hoped, however, that the situation will be straightened out. Bethlehem B sold to a new low at 6S%. Midvalo was relatively strong, losing 1 % to 45.	’	i

A buying movement started in Com Products and the ‘stock gained % to 44%. Corn Products has been inactive’ for a month or more. Earnings are showing steady improvement and accumulation of the stock has been steady. A dividend in the immediate future is not considered likely but it is most likely that stockholders will demand some return if the company holds oif much longer from declar-, ing dividends.	■
104%. Bethlehem B rallied on the statement of the Ship-p;ng Board that cancelled contracts covered only troop ships and not cargo vessels. American Sumatra advanced 2% from the low to 106%. Baldwin, :n which there has been recent pool activity, sold ofT 2% to ■ 9%< Reports was current that some of the houses which had, figured prominently in the Baldwin market were among those who were forced to reduce loans.	i
Motor Stocks Act Well	I
. Motor stocks acted well. White Motors, pajmg 84; and Pierce-Arrow, paying $5, sold on a parity around 46., Studebaker and Stutz joined in the upward movement; General Motors was reactionary.	i
Earnings of Steel Common	|
The net earnings of the Steel Corporation in tho: September quarter, after taxes and charges, were at the; rate of $16 a year on the common stock. The corporation had been paying dividends at the rate of 817. The reason for a reduction is obvious. The point on which the public lacks full information, however, is the allowance for taxes. This allowance for the September quarter was approximately $102,000,000. Although earning less, in other words, tho corporation laid aside more for taxes than in anv other quarter. If it had not been for the deduction of an additional $45,000,000 for Federal taxes, the September quarter would have been the second largest j quarter in the corporation’s history. Nearly one half of the $234,000,000 set aside for taxes in the nine-months’ period came out of the September quarter The aggregate results for the nine-months showed $19 a share earned for the common, even after most liberal allowance for taxes. This showing had led some to believe that the 17% rate would be continued until the end of the calendar year. The best opinion in the Street, however, repoatedlv recounted in this column, was to the effect that the dividend would be cut. Those who took this view pointed out that the eight-hour schedule and anotnor 10% Increase in wages during the last quarter made the cut necessary. --	.«	i _ .1 a_{— nJ.nc	crfAail nrnA.
If there had been ’an increase in prices of steel products, the ease would have been different. There was good | buying of Steel between 109 and 107 by the very inter-; csts who believed that the dividend would be cut. If the j regular 17% rate had been assured for several years,; Steel common would have been selling around 200. At; 105 It has probably discounted unfavorable develop-j mints.
Another Selling Wave
Another selling wave struck the market in the early afternoon, and prices went still lower; and Steel common, which seemed to be pegged in the early morning at 105. yielded easily in the afternoon, and was off 4% puint3 to 103%. Republic. Bethlehem B, and Crucible were weak spots. American Smelters joined in the slide of values. Mexican Pctro'oum broke to 150. Atlantic Gulf yielded over two points. Rails held relatively better.
Mysterious Buying
Who is buying all the stocks’ The public has been admonished over and over again by the bankers not to get excited over stocks, and it is assumed that the public is not deep in the market. Selling has been encouraged and yet the market has absorbed offerings in a wonderful way. There is a natural supposition that big interests arc quietly taking stocks forced on tlie market through the forced liquidation of loans. At the vrry time when there is most alarm over the money market, time money makes its appearance in liberal amounts. This is another factor which is hard to understand in flic face of the cries for conservation of credit.
A View on the Money Situation
One of the larges*, traders sums up the money situation as follows: “The Money Committee is not after everybody. A house with a capital of $5,000,000 which has Tbans of $3,000,GOO outstanding is certainly not in ths danger class and such a house will not he molested. But a house with $1,000,000 capital and loans of $10,000,000 presents another case, and this is the house which the Money Committee is after. Such a house must clean up its accounts, and rightly sr«. The Money Committee is .also after certain individuals. A man who had one hundred shares of Mexican Petroleum at K0 found that he had four thousand shares at ISO. The Money Comittee is after a man of this kind. Fundamentally, the money situation is sound and tho stork market is sound. I think that the readjustment can be carried on without much of a shake-up.”
Good Buying on Decline
Another liquidating wave, and the worst of the series, shook the market in the last hour and broke prices all through the industrial and railroad lists. Steel went to 102 for a net loss of 6. Marine preferred broke 3% points. Mexican Petroleum was off 14& points at 145%. Distillers broke 2 points. One house sold 20,000 shares of stock and bought only 400 shares. Another house, acting for a larger house which is credited with holding more Steel common than any other house in the Street, was a heavy buyer of Steel from 105 down, replacing stock which had been sold on the rise from 110 to 114. This buying was characterized as good. It was worth noting that the bond market held up well in the face of liquidation in stocks. This indicated that the investment market in bonds was not disturbed by the forced liquidation of loan* called by the farious Eanka.
