The Dow-Jones industrial average yesterday fell 17.37 points, or 2.84'r, as stock prices generally declined throughout the day. But trading was quiet and orderly, contrasting sharply with last week’s massive volume.
The slock exchange ticker never tell more than three minutes late in reporting transactions on the trading floor yesterday; last week the ticker was over an hour late much ot the time Volume yesterday decreased to 5.380.000 shares from 5.760 000 Friday and from more than 14 million shares last Tuesday. But yesterday's total was still well above the average daily volume so far this year.
The decline in the stock market began with the start of trading and continued to the close, as the Dow-Jones stock averages all worked lower and lower at each hourly reading. Only the gold-mining stocks as a group resisted the downward slide as 1,110 stocks of 1,335 traded yesterday closed lower than on Friday.
The Dow-Jones industrial average, at its close of 593.68, was down 18.20 points from the end of the week before last, prior to the huge decline and subsequent recovery ot Memorial Day week. But it was 16.75 points above its closing last Monday, when the average plummeted to its lowest closing level of the year to date. Yesterday's close was 141.23, or 19.2%, below the record high for the industrial average, set Dec. 13. 1961.
The Dow-Jones railroad average yesterday declined 3.18 points, or 2 47%, to 125 72. and the utility average went down 2 86 points, or 2.51%. to 111.10.
American Telephone & Telegraph continued as the most active stock for the eighth consecutive trading day, falling 4% to 106% on turnover of 119.900 shares. The stocks ot other leading corporate giants, such as StSndard Oil (New Jersey), General Motors and Bethlehem Steel, also were actively traded and all closed lower than on Friday.
Stocks of companies selling at high multiples of their per-share earnings were hard-hit again. Litton Industries, the fourth most active stock, sank 13% pohits to 85% on volume of 58,500 shares; Zenith Radio drooped 4% to 48% on transfer of 43 100 shares; and Polaroid went down 10% to 110’i as 39,400 shares traded.
Several market analysts viewed the market’s decline without alarm. "It’s normal,” one said, "to see the market 'test' its low after any turbulent sell-off and recovery." By this, he said, he meant stock prices probably would decline enough to cause the Dow-Jones industrial average to fall close to, or perhaps below, the low point it touched last week, before stabilizing above that point.
That the market dropped on substantially less volume than last week was "about the only consoling feature" of the day. one large brokerage firm stated after the close. Several other firms mentioned they thought the decreased volume was "a good sign.”
"We're looking for the market to fluctuate within a range of 5% on either side ot 600 in the Dow-Jones Industrial average for a while," a research partner of a large firm said. "That’s not too exciting, but we think there’ll be some exciting swings in individual stocks, especially In 5*e.over-the-counter market. The selling last Monday really caused some grief there and distorted values. We think some good buys are available," he continued.
Asked how he's advising customers to act in the current market, this analyst replied: “That depends on the client. If he’s got some cash he can buy, putting emphasis on fairly low price-earnings ratios and reasonable return. If hd's still got a portfolio full of high fliers, he might lighten up even at these prices."
Another research partner Indicated he thought yesterday’s decline might be part of a continued downward move in stock prices. "The damage that's been done to investment confidence last week isn’t likely to be removed quickly,” he stated. “A new conservatism calls for more value to attract longer-term Investment* buying, and price-earnings ratios and Income return will assume greater Importance. In this connection, you can readily see that if the Dow-Jones industrials sell at 15 times estimated 1962 earnings of 336 a 'share' and yield 4.25% on probable 1962 cash dividends of *22, the average would then be around the 525-540 range. Its close yesterday was 593.68.”
Selling by foreign Investors wasn't a major factor in the stoek market's decline last week’ or' yesterday, according to stock exchange member firms with offices in Europe. Several partners in charge of foreign office operations stated that, if anything, foreign investors have been more often buyers than sellers in the past week.
Business news wasn't all good. Steel production in the week to June 2 decreased to the lowest level in over a year. The National Association ot Purchasing Agents reported "some bogging down" in the pace of recovery last month.	.

On the other hand, most companies were reported going ahead with plans to expand and modernize their plants despite the stock market’s drop. In addition, the Kennedy Administration was reported planning big tax cuts and budget deficits to spur an economic upturn, moves that in the past have touched off stock market advances. Yesterday, the news had little effect.

Analysts explained the gains, a frequent occurrence in a long market decline, as the result of buying by investors seeking a hedge against a possible devaluation of the dollar at sometime in the future. "Obviously, this- school of thought is getting a larger following," said one broker.
Drug company stocks were particularly weak. Merck went down 4 to 68%: Chas Pfizer fell 3% to 41%; Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical dropped 3% to 68%: American Home Products declined 4% to 53%; Abbott Laboratories. 2% to 65%; Sterling Drug, 4% to 65; Richardson-Merrell. 1% to 70%: and Schering, 2% to 41%.

Heard on the Street-
General Electric will spend *523,000 to modernize its Erie Foundries facility at Erie. Pa., and expand its product line to include steel castings and such nonferrous lines as aluminum and copper base metals. . . . Colorado Fuel t Iron planrf to spend *18 million to *20 million on capital improvements this year, up from *13,331,178 in 1961, according to Leonard C. Rose, president. Nearly *10 million of the 1962 sum will be for a new wide flange beam mill with annual capacity of 60,000 tons due to go into operation at the Pueblo, Col., -plant in October. "This should improve our business for other products because it will complete our line for the construction trade," Mr. Rose explains. . . . Tenax (over the counter), producer of coin-operated dry cleaning and laundry machines, is believed to have earned a record *500,000 or more, or 75 to 80 cents a share, in the six months ended March 31 on sales in excess of $6.4 million, according to Leon C. Hirsch, president. Comparable figures are not available because of accounting changes made last year, he says. But for all fiscal 1961 the company had a deficit of *1,498,-221 on operating revenues of $7,759,180. Last year, however, Tenax was in the freezer sales business, which it has completely liquidated. Mr. Hirsch says Tenax has written off a substantial portion ot losses on old freezer receivables from prior years' surplus.
