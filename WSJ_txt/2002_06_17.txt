NEW YORK -- It turns out that stock prices are capable of something other than trading inexorably lower.
After four weeks of declines left market averages depressed, stocks snapped back in an impressive rally yesterday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which came into the session at its lows for the year after having posted losses in each of those four weeks, rose 213.21 points, the biggest one-day rally, in points, since surging 305.28 points May 8. The advance lifted the index 2.25% to a close at 9687.42. The Nasdaq Composite Index also notched its biggest single-session gain in more than a month, adding 48.55 points, or 3.23%, to finish at 1553.29.
Financial stocks paced the recovery. The group has been scorched lately, in part because of concern about its exposure to declining capital markets. But yesterday, investors used the group as a proxy for the market as a whole.
Among banks, Citigroup gained $2.63, or 6.5%, to $42.83, Mellon Financial added 1.10, or 3.3%, to 34.78, and Bank of America rose 2.26, or 3.2%, to 73.36.
Brokerage firms also enjoyed an unexpectedly successful campaign. Morgan Stanley advanced 2.77, or 6.5%, to 45.12. Lehman Brothers Holdings increased 2.81, or 4.7%, to 62.65. Goldman Sachs Group rose 2.49, or 3.4%, to 75.34.
Insurance issues, another financial sector, also made some improvement. Shares of American International Group, which traded at a 52-week low Friday, climbed 4.34, or 6.7%, to 68.80, ahead of the investor conference the company will stage today.
Refreshing as it was to see so many sectors on the rise, market watchers weren't taking the improvement wholly at face value. The big move came on relatively thin trading volume on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. That, coupled with the absence of any real shifts in fundamentals, suggested the move lacked the kind of conviction such an outsized motion might otherwise suggest.
"What we're seeing is a kind of defensive, liquidity-driven buying pattern," Brian Belski, chief fundamental market strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said yesterday. "Investors want to be back in the market, but only in those big, liquid stocks, which would allow them to get out quickly and without much damage if the market reverses on them."
Shares of some wireless-equipment makers rose. Cellphone-handset manufacturer Nokia, for example, gained 80 cents, or 6.4%, to 13.26, bouncing back after having reached a 52-week low Friday. The Finnish concern said it would introduce a mobile phone with a color screen and picture-messaging capabilities in the third quarter. Shares of rival handset producer Motorola added 80 cents, or 5.1%, to 16.40. Optical fiber maker Corning, which slid to a 52-week low last week, rose 28 cents, or 7.2%, to 4.17.
However, communications-services providers, which have suffered from declining stock values and deteriorating fundamentals, finished lower again. Shares of Sprint shed 65 cents, or 5.5%, to 11.10 after Standard & Poor's Friday cut its credit rating on the company's debt; Sprint paper now carries a rating just one notch above junk status. The tracking stock for Sprint's PCS Group wireless operation dropped 30 cents, or 6.8%, to 4.10.
Nextel Communications slumped 46 cents, or 10%, to 4.03 on Nasdaq.
Anthem gained 2.11, or 3%, to 73.50. The Indianapolis health-care benefits provider said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it expected to live up to earnings expectations for this year.
McDonald's improved 70 cents, or 2.4%, to 29.82. The fast-food chain raised its guidance for the quarter and full year, thanks to favorable foreign-exchange rates, and better-than-expected U.S. sales.
Timken jumped 3.27, or 16%, to 24.19. The Canton, Ohio, steel-products maker increased its second-quarter and full-year guidance, citing strength in the automotive industry, as well as the benefits of recent restructuring efforts.
