In tbe se-
A top-heavy speculative curities and commodities markets was pushed over today, with prices breaking sharply all along‘the line in extremely heavy trading. The break . in ’ stocks was precipitated by another drastic sell-off in the alcohol shares, which tumbled with startling rapidity and brought selling in other groups, where prices had been run up swiftly in the late stages of tbe advance. Breaks in the leaders of the alcohol group ran to 25 % points, as the sellers found buyers in a cautious mood. A wild break in wheat' which dropped as much as 13 cents a bushel, was followed by a smash in the agricultural implement shares, and the whole market gave way in the afternoon. The railroad and utility stocks, which have not shared m the recent run-ups, held a little better than other groups, but losses ran up to three points in some of the leaders. The trading reached 7,400,000 shares, the second largest session of the year so far. The tape lagged 18 minutes behind tbe market at- one time.
A break in the alcohol stocks had been anticipated for some time, and the financial community had been fearful of the effect it would have on the rest of the list. When selling went forward in National Distillers, U. S. Industrial Alcohol and others of the group during the morning, those 'With profits in other groups rushed to take them, and lower prices were tbe result. The generally favorable tenor of the day's news, which included some excellent carloadings reports, was ignored. Other cheering items included an advance in the price of copper, which sold up to 9% cents a pound, and the electric output figures, recording the largest percentage gain over the like 1932 week - so far scored.
Speculative bonds felt liquidation, but recessions were not so great as in stocks. Bestgrade bonds held fairly well. Foreign Government issues were firm, with United States obligations irregular.
The break in wheat was the widest seen in some years and come abruptly. At one time, the major cereal was off as much as 13 cents a bushel as public liquidation found few buyers in the pit. Final prices showed gains of as ’much as l>i cents from the lows, but declines on the day reached 9% to 11% cents. Stop-loss orders were caught in heavy volume on the set-back, and liquidation was under way from all quarters. Prices fluctuated as much as half a cent between sales. There was no material support on the break. Cotton took a nose-dive, losing $2 a bale, and other commodity markets were weak.
Foreign markets were mixed. in Paris, the list was lower, with the exception of rentes. In London, prices were irregular.
Bolstering Bank Loans
The wide rise in stock prices has made many a bank loan, which was far, far undercollateralized, take on the semblance of a pretty well secured obligation. In no case is this more strikingly demonstrated than in that of the Cleveland Terminals Building Co., controlled by the Van Swerlngen Corp, through ownership of the building company’s capital stock. The building company has a bank loan of $23,350,000. Its position is extremely important, as part of the collateral under it is 1,484,170 shares ot Alleghany Corp, common, roughly 37% of the stock outstanding, representing working control of the railroad holding company.
At the end of 1932, the collateral pledged under the loan had a market value of only $2,633,671. At tbe present time, due principally to the rise in the market price of Alleghany Corp, common, the value of the pledged collateral is up to around $13,100,000. It is still a long way from making the Ioan fully collateralized, but the picture is vastly different from the one presented by the figures for the year-end.
951,291 for tbe month,' showing that expenses were well under the June, 1932, figure.	'
390,000,000 Drop tn Alcohol Issues
Hie two-day decline in the alcohol stocks has gone a long way toward correcting a speculative situation that made the entire 'financial' 'community extremely nervous. The - set-back in the alcohol stocks found some of the group off as much as SO points from their recent highs at last night’s close. The aggregate decline in the market value of United States Industrial Alcohol, American Commercial Alcohol, Commercial Solvents and National Distillers shares from their recent highs amounts to about 360,000,000.
The industrial average closed at 103X58. erasing all the gain scored since July 11, while the rail average, at 54.01, was back under the July 5 finish. In view of the fact that such a drop-as occurred yesterday normally is followed by margin calls and some further liquidation, the market should be called on to meet a real test of its strength in today’s session.
Brokers and banks which have stock collateral loans, are steadily increasing their margin requirements, and are marking down the prices at which highly volatile stocks are carried as security for collateral loans.

report, and
Wage Increases and the Cfiiain Stores
The Administration's insistence on the necessity of increasing purchasing power has brought steady buying into the chain store and mail order house shares, which are being picked up on even minor set-backs. Chain store sales should be the first to reflect the enlarged public buying which should follow any increase in purchasing power. So far, the improvement in sales of some of the chain store units has been somewhat disappointing.	’
The test of public buying will come in the fall. Sizable price advances in numerous lines are looked for, and there is a question as to how the public will react to the increases.
Power Output and Earnings
Power output figures for the latest week recorded a widening of the percentage increase over the 1932 level, and sent production upward once more. A few companies, in the highly Industrialized areas, now are sending out mn— power than at any time since 1929, and one or two are very close to the 1929 level. The change in earnings has not been so marked as the improvement in power output, but June figures for some companies will serve as an offset to the nervousness over the situation of the utility companies caused by rate reductions and other attacks.
American Power & Light is one company which showed a very small betterment in June net over June, 1932, and wider gains were scored by such companies as American Water Works. American utility companies operating abroad have had a turn for the better in their affairs, too. They are benefiting not only from improvement in demand but also from tbe depreciation of the dollar in the foreign exchange market.
Big June for Illinois Central
Illinois Central’s June report was enough to send the stock spurting to a new high for the year. The statement was tbe best put out so far by any carrier, with net operating Income about nine times that for the like month of 1932. Gross revenues for tbe month reflected the improvement in the road’a traffic, moving to $7,947,500, up 51,129,571. Conclusive proof that the road is keeping a firm hand on operating costs was given by a comparison of the increase in gross and the upturn in operating income. Operating income actually was up $1,-
