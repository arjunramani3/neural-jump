Optimism about the economy sent stocks higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving above the 8000 level for most of the day and the Nasdaq Composite Index
finishing up 1.6% this year.
The Dow fell back a bit at the end of the session to finish up 216.48 points, or 2.8%, at 7978.08, its third consecutive gain. The industrials are up 6.1% over three days and on pace for the best four-week rally since 1938. The Dow remains down 9.1% in 2009.
Thursday's rally began in the morning with financial stocks, in anticipation of a Financial Accounting Standards Board decision to ease mark-to-market accounting rules that banks complained force them to undervalue their assets, and it picked up speed after the decision was announced. An unexpected gain in factory orders added to optimism about the economy.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped 7.9% amid hopes that an economic upturn would boost shares of trucking companies, airlines and railroads. The S&P 500-stock index rose 23.30 points, or 2.9%, to 834.38, led by gains of more than 5% in its industrial and consumer-discretionary categories. The financial sector was up 3%.
Bank of America closed up 2.7%, Citigroup rose 2.2%. But Morgan Stanley finished down 2.6% on concerns that it will report a quarterly loss.
The Nasdaq rose 3.3%. Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, reported better-than-expected earnings after the close and its shares jumped in after-hours trading.
