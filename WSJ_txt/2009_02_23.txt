Worries about the effects of a deepening recession sent stocks to early-1997 levels, as concerns about the health of big banks continued to spread to other sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 250.89 points, or 3.4%, to 7114.78, its lowest close since May 7, 1997. It rallied briefly at the open on news that the government is in discussions to take a large stake in Citigroup, before heading down steadily.
By afternoon, the Dow had broken its low of Oct. 27, 1997, known as Bloody Monday, when its 7.2% drop was fueled by an economic crisis in Asia.
This time it was the U.S. economy that worried investors. Technology stocks fell after Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report that unit sales of personal computers could fall 11% this year, the biggest decline on record, and revenue in the global market could decline 24%. Other economically sensitive sectors, such as basic materials shares and energy, also fell.
"There's no conviction in any section of the marketplace," said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. "There's just nobody who has an interest in jumping in and sustaining any level -- no support."
Of the Dow's 30 components, 27 ended in the red. The only exceptions were Citi, which rose 9.7% to $2.14 a share, and Bank of America, which managed a 3.2% gain to end at $3.91. General Motors ended unchanged, at $1.77.
International Business Machines, the highest-price stock in the price-weighted Dow, fell 5%. Alcoa was the Dow's biggest decliner in percentage terms, down 7.6%.
The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite Index, which had held up relatively well compared with measures with more financial exposure, had the biggest percentage drop among major indexes Monday, off 3.7%. Intel, a component of the Dow and the Nasdaq, was down 5.5%.
The broad S&P 500 fell 3.5% to 743.33, its lowest close since April 11, 1997. All its sectors posted declines, including a 3.5% drop in its financial sector.
Some investors say the declines could get worse. Projections based on declining earnings estimates for the S&P, that the index could fall somewhere between 500 and 600, "are not inconceivable," said Keith Bliss, senior vice president, Cuttone & Co. "We're just not in an environment where people feel good about stepping in just to lose money again."
S&P's chief technical analyst last week lowered his forecast for a market bottom this year to between 625 and 675, from around 750.
Oil fell 4% to $38.44 a barrel amid renewed concern about weakening demand. After hitting near record levels last week, gold fell 0.7% to $994.60 an ounce.
