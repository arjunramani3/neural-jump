Industrials Drop to Lowest Level in 3% Years, Off 21.20 Points to 770.57 on Bank Loan Surgv
Bl VllTuK J H1LLEKY
A surge in New York City bank loan demand last week pulled the rug from under the stock market yesterday and the Dow Jones industrial average slid to its lowest level in more than 3% years. Trading activity quickened to its briskest pace in a month.
The industrial average skidded 21 20 points to 770.57, its lowest mark since it closed at 767 52 on Nov. 23, 1970 Its plunge yesterday was its steepest since it dropped
22.44	points last Feb. 4. The transportation indicator sank to a new 1974 low and the utility average bumped its lowest point since December 1957.
After the close on Friday it was announced that business loans at 12 leading New York City banks swelled to $1.1 billion in the week ended Wednesday "The bulge in these bank loan figures undoubtedly damped hopes for an early easing in monetary policy," commented Richard E. Scruggs, economist with Standard & Poor’s Corp.
Contributing to the pessimism was the move in recent days by a few banks to a 12% level in their prime, or basic, lending rate: yesterday Central National Bank of Cleveland boosted its rate to a record 12%%.
First National Bank of Chicago yestei-day raised its prime rate to 12%, but held it below its effective guidelines, which called for a prime of 12.46%. Chauncey E. Schmidt, First National’s president, said the rate wasn’t raised above 12% in the hope that rates are ‘‘at or near their peak and moderation will . . . have a stabilizing effect."
Among other factors that spurred selling yesterday, brokers said, was the fall of the industrial average below its 1973 low of 788.31, which discouraged some technicians. And there was some distress selling to satisfy margin calls. Margin is the amount of cash a customer must keep on deposit with a broker, and under New York Stock Exchange rules, member firms’ customers are required to maintain net equity of at least 25% of market value of all issues held; if equity falls below 25% and he doesn't put up cash to restore it, enough stock must be sold from his account to bring up the equity.
The damage in yesterday’s retreat was extensive. Big Board losers overwhelmed the gainers by more than 10-to-l with 1,441 issues down and 137 up at the close. A massive 607 stocks hit new 1974 lows, against 225 Friday, and again no issue hit a new high.
Volume Doubles From Friday
Big Board volume, rising to 15,510,000 shares, was more than double Friday’s total of 7,400,000, which was the lowest since 7,348,650 shares were traded on Oct. 25, 1971. At the final bell yesterday the exchange’s price quotation ticker was lagging floor trades by two minutes. Reflecting the greater institutional activity was the rise in the trades of 10,000 shares or more to 78 from 42 in the prior session.
Another depressant in yesterday’s stock market was the recent weakness in the bond market. Yesterday prices of prime corporates fell at least % point in over-the-counter trading and long-term governments about 16-32 point.
American Stock Exchange losers led the gainers by better than 6-to-l, and the exchange's index dropped 1.95 to 75.74. Turnover rose to 2,540,000 shares from 1,080,000 Friday. A sizable loss of 2.61 points also was posted by the National Association of Securities Dealers' NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter stocks; it ended at 70.96.	■
Stocks tumbling in yesterday’s slide included the computer, airline, housing, chemical, copper, retail, drug, electronic, machinery, movie, auto, oil, paper, publishing, television, rubber, steel, tobacco and savings-and-loan issues. In sharp con-

Glamour stocks were among the greatest casualties.
