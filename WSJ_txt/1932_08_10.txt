Bonds and stocks surged ahead into new high ground yesterday, spurred by higher prices for commodities. While gains in many stocks were wide, it was m the bond market that the most telling advances were scored. Second grade railroad issues fairly shat ahead to new highs on the current movement, and high-grade railroad bonds also were strong. Wheat at the uiu.-e, was up more than a cent a bushel, and cotton closed up around $1 a bale. At the nighs. cotton was up Si.50 a bale, passing the high points reached following publication of the Government’s crop report Monday.
In London, stocks and British funds were strong. The Paris bourse was heavy.
The advance in stock prices was achieved despite a number of developments which might have been expected to exert a depressing influence Loading’s of the Pennsylvania and the New York Central for the week ended August 6 both were below the totals for the preceding ftfteek. Directors of both Delaware & Hudson and Eastman Kodak voted to‘reduce the dividend. the former to a $6 annual basis from $9 previous!}. and the latter to .$3 from $5 Kodak broke on the dividend news, but the decline m the stock did not unsettle the general H«t.
Electric Output Decline \\ iden*
Electric output for the country in the latest week recorded a wider percentage decline than in the immediately preceding week. The backlog of orders of the United State* Steel Corp registered another decline, and copper prices abroad were a shade lower.
In the lace of this news, the market pushed ahead, with new highs being chalked up in many departments. The greatest earlv strength was in the rails. Union Pacific opened at around 63. then ran up swiftly to over 68. Chesapeake & Ohio, wmeh opened at 1S‘_. s-’d as high as 21. and Nev.- York Central crossed 24 after selling a*- low as 21'.. The genera! list fell in hn< with Telephone running i.p from its eirly lerw of 109’, tn above 11" and American Can from 31 to above 51 The t|l5^ .Aa«. strong. Transaction'- totaled 4.400.000 shares, against 3.SOO,000 shares Tuesday
The stock market yesterday showed none of the signs of weariness which were apparent in the preceding day’s trading. Heaw buying came in on the early reaction, part of it short covering. So far, according to a number of brokerage houses, purchases have brought about no important increase in debit balances, a* a large part of the buying has been outright From all accounts, the short interest in the niaikct continue* large, as traders skeptical of the advance have cont’iiued tn sell sfo-ks as pru.es worked higher Con.-en al;> oh-crveis were much miptesccl hv the-e laemrs and. while still suggesting caution believed the market s momentum was sufficient to cirry i’ further	*

Progress tn cutting down nil refinery operation'- i* continuing and is having a major effect in bettering the general oil situation For the week ended August 6, crude runs to still* were at 38 lr; of capacity, compared with 59 1'. of capacity in the preceding week. Cutting down on refinery output help* th<* general motor fuel market measurably
Storage of motor fuels was reduced about 1.121,000 barrels from the preceding week The oil companies always seek in bring about a big reduction in slot age of motoi fuel* during the season of heavy consumptive demand Tn tnv wintei month*. wh"n uemand shrinks substantially, storage goo* up
Last week’* increav in crude ml output wa* due to the mechanics of proration measure* m the Oklahoma field, and ver\ likely wi.l be offset m the current week An effort j« being made tn brtng the nude output level for the country as a whole down to 2,000.000 barrels daily. For the week ended August 6, this level was topped by about 171,000 barrels
The third quarter of the year generally is one of the two best for the oil companies, as it includes the months of high consumptive demand for motor fuel. If prices hold at present level* during the entire quarter, oil companies generally should show’ as favorable earning* as in the second quarter
Atchison Loading** Drop.	•
Due tn Lagging Grain Movement
The drop in Atchison’s loading* for the week ended August 6. a* compared with the previous week, was dun almost entirely to a falling ott in	loading-. The slackening m gram
movement was ascribed to the advance in juices, which impelled larmers to hold back then ship-I rnents as much as possible in the hope of getting ! higher figures for their grain.	°
Grape movement over the Atchison, which a little late this year, is slartmg The grape crop is large, but shipments will depend on ho*' prices hold up If past trends are followed, Atchison's loadings should pick up during th* two weeks ending August 20
United Electric Coal Up	„
Over 100% from Year’s Low
At its current price of around 5. United Electric Coal has moved up slightly more than 100% from the year’s low of 2«^. but the stock still is selling on a low ratio of price to earnings. For the first nine months of the company’s fiscal year, which ended July .30. the company reported net income equal to’$102 a share on the common stock.
The Illinois coal strike lessened United Electric Coal’s business, but in July, the company’s business became more normal. Under the management which took over United Electric’s affairs late in 1930. the company’s difficulties liave been overcome and it is paying oft its obligations. These payments are deducted before the net income figure is arrived at. As a strip miner, the company is a low-cost producer.
