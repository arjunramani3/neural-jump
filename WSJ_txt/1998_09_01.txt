It was a day when Wall Street called the shots, taking stock markets around the world on a volatile ride as they danced in close step with the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
But in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 index hit a 12-year low of 13664.74 early yesterday in response to Wall Street's decline Monday, the stock market ended the day up 1.9%, as government funds and short-covering helped to pull stock prices back into positive territory.
In Europe, stocks also took their cue from the U.S., first falling, then rising as the S&P futures appeared to indicate a strong start for Wall Street. Then, as New York opened for trading Tuesday, Europe closely tracked the Dow Jones industrials' ups and subsequent downs, leading to a very erratic day. Some European markets fell as much as 4% as the Dow industrials hit its early lows, before following the U.S. market back up. Germany closed up 0.9%, while the Netherlands ended down 1.7%, London down 1.5%, Sweden down 3%, Switzerland down 1.4%, and Finland down 3.3%.

It was a day when Wall Street called the shots, taking stock markets around the world on a volatile ride as they danced in close step with the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Monday's 6.37% drop in the industrial average knocked back many of the Asian stock markets yesterday and hit Europe early in the day.
"People are concerned about the global financial system," in particular the risks posed by Russia and Latin America, said Joe Rooney, global strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. What's more, he and other global strategists say, investors are worried that the world is entering a period of slower economic growth, resulting from Japan's economic slump and fears of a slowdown in U.S. consumer spending.
"If you look at what's happening in the market, you see more and more brokers with very negative scenarios. So markets will remain volatile for the short term, no doubt about it," said Hans Peters, a strategist at Fortis Investments in Utrecht, the Netherlands. However, he added, "Given our valuations and earnings outlook, we think that stock market prices are close to where they ought to be."
Yesterday, markets remained volatile. Most of the Asian stock markets plummeted when they started trading, responding to the Dow industrials' plunge Monday.
Hong Kong closed down 2.9%, following Monday's 7.1% decline, as the government appeared to be taking a pause from intervening in the stock market. Malaysia, meanwhile, plunged 13.3% in response to news that the country is imposing capital controls.
But in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 index hit a 12-year low of 13664.74 early yesterday in response to Wall Street's decline Monday, the stock market ended the day up 1.9%, as government funds and short-covering helped to pull stock prices back into positive territory.
In Europe, stocks also took their cue from the U.S., first falling, then rising as the S&P futures appeared to indicate a strong start for Wall Street. Then, as New York opened for trading Tuesday, Europe closely tracked the Dow Jones industrials' ups and subsequent downs, leading to a very erratic day. Some European markets fell as much as 4% as the Dow industrials hit its early lows, before following the U.S. market back up. Germany closed up 0.9%, while the Netherlands ended down 1.7%, London down 1.5%, Sweden down 3%, Switzerland down 1.4%, and Finland down 3.3%.
As the U.S. market stormed higher later in the day, it gave a boost to the still-open Latin American markets, most of which had fallen heavily Monday. Brazil rose 6.9% and Argentina jumped 8.8%. Meanwhile, north of the border, Canada edged up 0.1%.
Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 2.85 points, or 1.73%, to 167.60.
As trading resumed in Asia Wednesday, many markets in the region were on the rebound following the big gains on Wall Street. Malaysia had recovered 9% and Hong Kong had jumped 5.5% in early dealings. Japan closed the morning session up 0.7%, while South Korea was 1.7% higher at midday.
Asia's financial crisis and economic slump has pummelled stock markets in the region and scared away plenty of international investors. But while Asian stocks nosedived, investors piled into European and U.S. stocks. Markets in those regions mostly shrugged off the bad news out of Asia and powered higher to set record levels in the first few months of this year.
Now those rallies have faltered. European stock markets have been knocked well off their highs. After gaining as much as 50% to 60% by midyear, they are now showing year-to-date gains of 20% to 30% at most, and single-digit gains in the case of Sweden and Switzerland. Meanwhile, the U.S. market closed yesterday below where it started the year.
What's changed? For a start, Russia's devaluation and de facto default on its ruble-denominated debt last month dealt a terrible blow to some international investors and lenders. Banks, securities firms, and hedge funds with exposure to Russia are only now admitting how badly they were hit. Furthermore, Russia's collapse has hurt oth>er emerging-market currencies and economies.

"The problem really is that emerging economies -- where 80% of the world lives and where the greatest potential is for growth -- are in recession," said Marc Faber, managing director of a moneymanagement and investment-advisory firm that bears his name in Hong Kong.
Emerging economies typically have three pillars of growth: exports, foreign direct investments and domestic spending (consumption and investments). "What they're selling to the world is deflating in price," he said. "Although the [export] volumes may rise because of the devaluation of their currencies, they aren't earning that much more. In fact, the more they want to grow out of their problems with exports, the more they depress prices."
He also reckons that foreign direct investment is unlikely to rise, and could even fall, because of the existing overcapacity in Asia, and because of potential political problems in countries such as Indonesia and Russia.
"And now, following the Asian and Russian crises, [developing countries'] interest rates have gone sky-high in real [inflation-adjusted] terms," Mr. Faber added. "It's a catastrophe."
International Strategy & Investment, an economic consultancy in New York, noted in its daily fax to clients yesterday that with economic slowdowns in Asia, Russia, Latin America, Canada, the U.K., Eastern Europe, South Africa and the Middle East, there is "not much left" in terms of good news for investors.
"The Asian contagion, overcapacity and antigrowth policies have already clearly become problems for more than one-third of world GDP," ISI said. "This is a dangerous and indeterminate situation. . . . The Fed should lead a coordinated, G7 pre-emptive easing."
The rally in the U.S. stock market late in the day had the greatest impact on Latin American markets.
In SAO PAULO, Brazilian stocks soared to their intraday highs shortly before the market closed, pulled higher by a surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The Bovespa Index jumped 455 points, or 6.9%, to 6,917, while shares of Telebras, the privatized telecommunications-holding company, surged 7.4% to 89.70 reals per thousand shares after hitting an intraday high of 90 reals.
In BUENOS AIRES, the Merval Index finished 31.52 points, or 8.8%, higher at 390.01.
Steel companies Siderar and Acindar both closed 15% higher at 2.185 pesos and 1.035 pesos, respectively.
Telefonica added 30 cents, or 13.3%, to 2.55 pesos, while benchmark energy group YPF closed 2.24 pesos, or 10%, higher at 24.64 pesos.
Rallies in Latin America contrasted with the poor mood in many of the Asian and European markets.
In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index closed sharply lower Tuesday, hit by Standard & Poor's downgrade of Hong Kong's credit rating as well as Wall Street's drop the day before.
The blue-chip index fell 212.57 points, or 2.9%, to close at 7062.47, after trading between 6982.43 and 7306.40.
Rating agency Fitch IBCA joined in the latest round of downgrades when it cut the ratings of eight Hong Kong banks, reflecting the growing impact of "intensifying economic gloom" in the local market.
Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. and Hang Seng Bank, were among those downgraded. Shares in HSBC Holdings, which controls Hongkong Bank, fell 3.7% to HK$158.50, while its affiliate Hang Seng Bank lost 2.4% to HK$40.70.
Meanwhile, property group Cheung Kong fell 3.7% to HK$28.90, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 5.7% to HK$22.45, Hongkong Telecom dropped 2.9% to HK$13.30, and China Telecom fell 3.4% to HK$9.85.
In TOKYO, stocks staged a rebound to close sharply higher Tuesday, with the Nikkei 225 index moving in a 700-point range, after government-pension funds stepped in to support the market.
The Nikkei ended up 261.74 points or 1.9% at 14369.63, just 0.20 point off its high for the day. It tumbled to a low of 13664.74 in the opening minutes Tuesday, its lowest level since 1986.
"There was some PKO [price-keeping operations] and short-covering of the banks," said Michael Steinberg, a managing director at Nomura Securities International in New York, adding that "Most people are short banks."
Sakura Bank gained 10.5% to 274 yen. On Monday, it announced a plan to raise 300 billion yen in new capital through share allocations to Toyota Motor and companies belonging to the Mitsui group. Other bank stocks also rallied. Sumitomo Bank dipped to this year's low of 968 yen but rallied to finish at 1,051 yen, up 43 yen. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi rose 22 yen to 1,020 yen. Sumitomo Trust and Banking gained 10 yen to 349 yen.
In KUALA LUMPUR, the benchmark Composite Index fell 40.21 points, or 13%, to 262.70 after Malaysia introduced controls on the repatriation of money outside the country. With such controls in place, some investors fear Malaysia will be removed from the Morgan Stanley Capital International index, providing another incentive for selling Malaysian stocks.
Malaysian Airlines System fell 16% to 1.30 ringgit, Petronas Gas dropped 26% to 3.68 ringgit, and Telekom Malaysia plunged 20% to 4.34 ringgit.
In LONDON, where the market was closed Monday for a holiday, the blue-chip FTSE 100 share index closed down 80.3 points, or 1.5%, at 5169.1. It opened at a high of 5249.6, and traded as low as 5075.7.
Telecommunications stocks were hit, with shares in Orange down 97.5 pence, or 14%, to 612.5 pence, and Vodafone down 92 pence, or 11%, at 741 pence. Colt Telecom fell 18% to 2,110 pence.

Meanwhile, low oil prices hurt oil stocks. Enterprise Oil fell 25 pence to 352 pence, while Ranger Oil fell 32.5 pence to 327.5 pence, and Lasmo fell 4.5 pence to 159.5 pence.
