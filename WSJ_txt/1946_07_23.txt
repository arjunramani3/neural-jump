Market
Stocks have been acting “tired” in recent quiet markets. There have been a number of what the Street regarded as bearish factors xn the situation, including an increasing total of undigested new issues, higher money rates and economic confusion growing out of the uncertain status of price controls. Undoubtedly all this has brought selling into the market and many of those who have had long term profits have been taking them
Thin markets, too. have contributed to under price movements, on both the up side and the down side, and yesterday s declines of as much as 7 points were undoubtedly affected by this thin market situation Volume increased sharply as liquidation increased and at one time the maikct ran ahead ot tne tape Sales aggregated 1 690.000 shares, compared uith 690.000 the previous session.

The plan reduces prior charges ahead of the common stock by nearly $900,000 after taxes. In addition, it eliminates accumulated preferred dividend arrears, which amounted to over $17 million at the end of the 1945 fiscal year and over $15.3 million as ’of July 1 of this year. Earnings applicable to common stock will be further increased by the elimination of the excess profits tax.’ which amounted to about $9.2 million in 1945. The company’s business in the first six months of the current fiscal year was well ahead of last year, net earnings for the period which ended April 27 having been approximately $9 7 million, compared with $9.2 million reported for all of 1945
