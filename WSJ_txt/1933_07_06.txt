Buoyed by another flood of news testifying to the continued betterment in general industry, and stimulated by news from Washington detailing the three phases of the President’s program to spur domestic recovery, stocks surged upward "today to new high ground for the advance in trading, which ran to 6,540,000 shares. All groups of stocks shared in the broad upswing, but it was the railroad shares which, once again, turned in the largest advances and which attracted the heaviest buying. Oils and utilities also shared the limelight, and the tobaccos "surged ahead to new highs under insistent buying. In the late trading, the steels forged ahead, led by Bethlehem and U. S. Steel. The tape , lagged behind floor transactions < almost from the start.
The picture of the domestic industrial situation portrayed by the news coming to hand was enough to bring about a renewal of the buying impulse. Electric, production, in the latest week, showed a gain of 13.7% over the similar week of 1932. Loadings of the Pennsylvania, the Burlington and other carriers in the week ended July 1 recorded wide gains over the previous week and over the like week of 1932. Montgomery Ward’s June sales were up 8 9-10% over June, 1932, and June output of Chevrolet Motors was the highest for any month in two years.
In addition to these developments, word came of the decision of the Steering Committee in London to continue the Economic Conference. Foreign currencies, were calmer, traveling in a relatively narrow range. The outline of the President’s domestic program, too, was another item attracting buying in stocks. '
Among the rails, D., L, & W., Great Northern, Northern Pacific, New York Central and Pennsylvania assumed leadership. In the utilities, Columbia Gas, Consolidated Gas, American Water Works and Western Union were the features. Continental Oil and Standard Oil of New Jersey were in the forefront of the oil group. Farm equipment shares were pushed up, aided by the late run-up in wheat, which finished up to 1% cents a bushel.	'
Second-grade railroad obligations were the leaders in a strong bond market, numerous issues reaching new highs. Foreign obligations were steady, but governments were irregular.
Commodity markets traveled over a fairly swide range, but finished generally higher. The Tate mark-up in wheat was followed by corn, which reached new highs and closed up around 2 cents a bushel. Cotton gained $1.25 a bale.
In Paris, prices on the Bourse were lower. In London, the market was mixed.
dead of $2.50 a share by a good margin. Few were willing to speculate on the future of New York Central, which closed at 11, although Leo-nor. F. Loree, with years of experience behind him., was buying Central at ’that time. American Telephone closed at 72%; Consolidated "Gas at 33%; Baltimore & Ohio at 5%; Bethlehem Steel at 8%, and' United States Steel,' even though It was down to 21%, was considered no bargain.
Montgomery Ward closed on July 8 a year ago at 4%; Standard- Oil of New Jersey at 24; Anaconda "at 4, and National Distillers at 17%. Some of the officials of Louisville & Nashville had the temerity to buy L.& N. at around 10%, and there was a modicum of so-called informed buying in Great Northern, which was down to 6%. But the financial community did not hail the end of the bear market with any great wave of buying, and sentiment in Wall Street a year ago was more bearish than bullish.
Chain Store Soles Meet Expectations
The June sales reports of leading chain store and -mail order houses are coming fully up to the -expectations -held in the financial community. Montgomery Ward’s sales for June reached $16,165,180, up 8.9% from June, 1932. Sales by
W.	T. Grant stores recorded an advance of 11% from the June, 1932, total, and gains were scored by other chain store groups.
For Montgomery Ward, the improvement in June sales over the May figure was unusually large, in May, the company's business totaled only $15,152,788, and June showed an increase of a little more than .$1,000,000. In both 1932 and 1931, June business was only a very little ahead of the May total.	'
Mail order houses and chain stores are being helped, too, by the fact that profit margins are slowly widening, due to the advance in some retail prices; Advances, generally speaking, are not very extensive as yet, but if the current trend is maintained, normal profit margins'will be restored.	'■
Crude Rubber Surges Upward
Trading in crude rubber set a new high for the New York market yesterday, and rubber closed up 60 to 76 points, nor nearly a cent a pound. On the basis of current prices, the advance amounted to almost 10%. A total of 1,179 lots of rubber changed hands.
While the tire company shares traded in on the Stock Exchange were firm, none of them shared importantly in the general strength of the market. The leading tire company issues, like - Goodyear, Goodrich, United States Rubber and Firestone, have moved in a relatively narrow price area recently. The two commodities which affect the prices of their products, cotton and rubber, have moved ahead steadily. While the first quarter of 1933 was a bad period for the tire makers, the leaders in the industry did a very good business in the second quarter, and have had the benefit of Increases in • tire prices, as well as in prices for rubber goods.
Aiding Alleghany Corp.
For' the first time in many months, the market value of the collateral pledged under the
Alleghany Corp. 5s of 1944 and 1949 is once more in excess of 100% of the principal amount of the bonds of the two issues outstanding. With Chesapeake Corp, closing yesterday at 50%; the value of the 576,000 shares of this stock pledged under the Alleghany 5s of 1944 is roughly $29,230,000, and there are only $31,466,000 principal amount of Alleghaney 5s of 1944 outstanding. The market value of the 177,700 shares of Missouri Pacific common and 50,-OOO shares of Missouri Pacific preferred also pldeged under this issue brings the market value of these three stock holdings, alone, to above the principal amount of bonds ' outstanding. In addition, 50,000 'share's of Pittston and $4,066,000, principal amount of Terminal Shares, Inc., notes are pledged under these bonds.
The market value of the 449,000 shares of Chesapeake Corp, pledged under the Alleghany Corp, 5s of 1949, at yesterday’s close, was roundly- $22,780,000, almost $1,000,000 greater than the $21,938,000 principal amount of this issue outstanding....

High and Low Prices
• Thursday, on the New York Stock Exchange, 236 stocks made new highs and one stock made a new low, for the year 1933.
Exchange Borrowings at New High
The enlarged public participation in the stock market, which has weakened the technical position of the market to some extent, was attested to by the sharp rise in New York Stock Exchange member, collateral borrowings during the month of June, "borrowings of member firms of the Exchange, ifrithe end of June, were up 47% from the end ot tliq. previous month, and they are now more than trhblp. the record low. Considering the position of'*thie market, and the extent of the advance since a year ago, the rise in member collateral borrowings is not out of proportion to the upswing in security prices. The upturn during the month of June, however, was pretty extensive, considering that the level of the market, as measured by the Dow-Jones industrial average, advanced only around 7% during-the month.
A Year of a Bull Market
The first year of price recovery, following the long depression which began in late 1929 and terminated on July 8, 1932, ends today. The general price level for stocks touched its low on July 8, and the recovery which ensued was touched off by the first major event designed to turn the course of world prices.. That was the Lausanne Accord, terminating German reparations payments, which had been a prime factor in dislocating the flow of world trade.
The announcement of the Lausanne Accord had no immediate effect on the American securities markets. It did bring considerable foreign buying into stocks, but the real -upswing in prices, which extended to early September, 1932, did not get underway until late in July.
Some idea of the enormous rise in stock, prices which has taken place over the last 12 months may be gathered by a comparison of closing prices on July 8, 1932, with current prices. Chesapeake & Ohio, on that date, closed it 10, and investors were hesitant about buying It, although the management insisted at that time the company would cover its common divi-
