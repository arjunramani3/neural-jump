In Busiest Day Ever, Stocks Take a Plunge But Then Start Higher
Dow Jones Industrials End
With Drop of 8.27 Points;
‘A Little Scary at Times’
Remembering 50 Years Ago
A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
Hectic trading activity yesterday swamped the stock market with the biggest volume in its history.
New York Stock Exchange turnover soared to 81,620,000 shares. Volume also reached a record level on the American Stock Exchange.
Prices during the day were caught in a monumental tug-of-war, with selling pressures twice threatening to turn the contest into a rout. Most stocks ended with losses, but two strong buying waves boosted many issues above their lows of the day. At the final bell, prices still were recovering.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 25 points a few minutes after 1:30 p.m., but the loss narrowed to 8.27 points at the close. The average closed at 849.32, the lowest level in more than two months.
The market’s improvement late in the day showed up in the breadth figures, too.
In addition to the decline in the stock market, bond prices fell sharply yesterday and forced drastic price concessions to be granted on International Business Machines's 31 billion new issue (see story on page 2). Stock prices also tumbled in Europe and Canada (see story on page 5). And in the currency markets, the American dollar generally weakened. But gold prices rose again (see story on page 3).
which had as few as 25 stocks gaining against 1,532 stocks dropping shortly before noon. At the close, 133 issues were up and 1,657 down.
The broad decline, which started on Monday, has been viewed as a fearful reaction by investors to the Fed’s moves late Saturday to tighten credit in an effort to fight inflation.
On the New York Stock Exchange trading floor, brokers described the mood as subdued but, for the most part, orderly. “There isn't as much gloom and doom around here as you might have expected," one floor broker said. Frank Racanelli, a broker with Icahn & Co., a New York securities firm, said, "It’s been a little scary at times, but we can handle it."
Off the floor, some brokers even tried to inject some humor into the situation. A broker at a St. Louis-based firm was answering his phone with, “Yes, we're still in business.”
Cleansing the Atmosphere
Most brokers reached by Wall Street Journal reporters in dozens of cities yesterday said they see little panic selling so far. But at times and in places, near-panic appeared to set in.
In midday, when the market was at its lowest ebb, clients were “absolutely panicked," says Lisa Marini, an account executive at Merrill Lynch’s Chicago office. • "They're referring to the crash of 1929." In the Dallas office of Hall Cobb & Caudle Inc., broker Charles Bankhead, agrees. “Those who are old enough are remembering 1929."
Comparisons to 1929 may be premature. In Pittsburgh, a broker who was working at the time of the October 1929 stock-market crash isn’t worried. Howard Butcher, chairman emeritus of Butcher & Singer Inc., says the sell-off “isn’t a catastrophe.” He adds. “This will cleanse the atmosphere. In the next two or three weeks, we’ll be on our way to the biggest rally you ever saw.”
But few were anywhere near that optimistic. James M. Coyne, a Butcher & Singer vice president, says, “I’ve got five clients who have sold everything. Nobody's asking about prices, they’re just selling."
Margin Calls
Much of such selling was by customers who had purchased stock qn credit and were facing margin calls from brokers because of the declining values of their holdings. People with margin accounts have been "trying to sell at any price," says Fred Lipsitz, a broker at Pittsburgh’s Parker/Hunter Inc. “In some cases, they haven’t been able to sell," he says, and he has to keep calling them to calm them down.
“We have some customers liquidating because of margin costs," says Thomas Moy-Ian, vice president of Merrill Lynch’s Boston retail office, although "none of the customers are panicking.’' Interest rates on margin accounts now are as high as 16%, he says, up from 13% last week for small investors. “Rates are so high that you have to make more than 17% to make money-more than 18% after commission costs."
But he maintains that customers aren't having serious problems because most of them had “lightened up" on margin accounts in recent months. He adds philosophically, “Having the interest rates on margin accounts go up is probably what the Fed wanted."
"For margin purposes, I have to sell," says John Schumacher, a customer at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc.’in Minneapolis. "Even if I wanted to borrow short-term, it costs a lot. I can’t afford not to sell. That’s what's forcing everything down.”
In Pittsburgh, Raymond Burda, an engineer who says he has about $250,000 Invested in the stock market, is hoping he can avoid margin calls. “I can't afford to sell" to reduce margin exposure, he says. "I still have a few bucks in the bank, and I made up my Please Turn to Page 47, Column j

Continued From First Page mind to wait it out.” He adds, “I'm not numb, but just how much I'm feeling at this point I can't say."
William Rogan, Chicago branch manager for Shearson Loeb Rhoades Inc., says, “There've been only a few margin calls, and most of the customers sound concerned at worst. “Most of our clients are veterans. They've seen this happen before."
But some saw a brighter side. Also in Chicago, broker Peter Kutza, who had been advising most clients to put their funds into moneymarket instruments, says he thinks the time is right for them to start buying stocks. “Where
there's confusion, there's opportunity," he says.
Yesterday, a new element of concern was raised on Wall Street as gold prices rebounded in Europe while the dollar, recently strong, put in a lackluster performance. “Gold’s strength is suggesting, and the nervous trading in the dollar could be signaling, that the Fed's effort isn't enough," said Larry Wachtel, first vice president at Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc. That means, Mr. Wachtel said, that the Fed's actions might require further bolstering-raising fears of even higher interest rates and a worse economic contraction than has been expected.
Brokers said yesterday's selling came from all kinds of customers. Some were institutions; others were frightened individual investors, particularly individuals who had bought on margin, or partial credit.
Only last Friday, the market as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a new 1979 peak of 897.61. In the past three days alone, that indicator has fallen 48.29 points. Many stocks outside the average have fallen even more sharply.
The Record Volume
On the Big Board yesterday, trading volume surpassed the Aug. 3, 1978, record of 66,370,000 shares at 2:22 p.m., the exchange said.
The old volume peak was accompanied by a 3.38-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial average, capping a 22.78-point advance on Aug. 2,1978. Ironically, the market climbed on those two days mainly because investors were convinced that interest rates were peaking. By contrast, this week's decline and much of yesterday’s selling activity are partly attributable to fears of runaway interest rates and the crushing of hopes for an early end to the rise in borrowing costs.
On the American Stock Exchange, yesterday’s trading activity bested a volume record that had stood for nearly 10 years. The old mark of 11,355,410 shares was set on Dec. 31,1969. First-hour volume on the Amex of 3,499,600 shares also set a record, eclipsing the 3,278,000 shares in the first hour on Oct. 30,1978.
The day’s torrid selling activity on the Big Board started from the opening 10 a.m. bell, when the industrial average was down more than four points. The loss quickly widened to about 17 points in the next two hours as selling persisted. But at midsession, there was a mild rally effort, when some buying from traders trying to cover their "shorts," or borrowed stock, came in to buy. The average's loss was pared to about eight points over the noon hour, but the modest improvement gave

looking at is a test of the 788 level in the industrial average,” said Donald Hahn, investment strategist at A.G. Becker Inc. in Chicago.
The environment at this time, Mr. Hahn believes, contains the basic ingredients for a bear market. Those ingredients, he said, are weakening business conditions, tightening money policy, high inflation and interest rates, an abnormal investor interest in speculative stocks, and deteriorating market technical indicators.
Reversing the Spiral
However, some analysts assert it still is too early to count stocks out, or to be sure that a credit crunch and a severe economic recession lie ahead because of the Fed's moves. “The downward pressure that will develop in the economy in conjunction with the Fed's recent restrictive moves should reverse the sharp spiral in interest rates and the demand for credit,” said Frank Mastrapasqua, economist and investment strategist at L. F. Rothschild & Co. This period of market weakness should be taken as one of the opportunities to accumulate stocks again, he said.
Yesterday’s action was particularly hectic in the oil stocks, which had been among the market’s biggest gainers before this week's market drop and were among the hardest-hit on Monday and Tuesday.
In a few cases, early deficits were wiped out yesterday. Gulf, for example, closed at 32%, up %, after being as low as 30%; and Mobil, trading as low as 47% at one point, rebounded to close at 50%. Both were among the day's most active issues.
In most instances, the oils ended the day above their lows but still showed losses from Tuesday's close. Superior Oil, the Big Board stock with the heftiest price tag, dropped 21 points, closing at 523 after touching 515. Superior traded at a new 12month high of 572 Just last Friday.
Texaco led the Big Board actives with more than 1.1 million shares changing hands. It closed at 29%, off %. Also active were Occidental Petroleum, which finished at 23%, off %; Exxon at 58%, off %; Atlantic Richfield at 72%, off %; and Charter Co. at 39, up %. Among other major oils. Standard of California closed unchanged at 57%,- off %, and Getty at 63%, off 1%;

way to renewed selling pressure at about 12:40 p.m.
Over the next two hours, the industrial average sank as much as 25 points. However, slightly before 3 p.m., buyers again reasserted themselves in supportive moves that continued into the closing bell.
The day's unprecedented volume proved too much for the Big Board's high-speed price-quotation tape, which ran late almost from the opening of trading. The tape lagged about 40 minutes in the morning, and the delay worsened in the afternoon to more than an hour. The record delay before yesterday was 35 minutes on Oct. 30, 1978.
Brokers said the delay in the tape transmission widened whenever a flurry of buying occurred, as was the case at midday and again in the afternoon.
The huge influx of orders in the morning delayed the opening of more than 100 stocks, including such issues as IBM, Exxon, Westinghouse and Allied Chemical. Many of the Canadian oil stocks, mostly traded on the American Stock Exchange, also were late in opening.
Through most of yesterday's trading, many would-be buyers held back, partly because of the confusion caused by the quotation tape's lateness in reporting actual transactions. That lateness made it difficult to tell what the true “market" price was for a given stock.	.
Others stood aside because they fear even further damage to prices. "When they tum this market around, I'll have plenty of time to buy, but when this kind of selling comes, you don't have any time at all to get'out,” said one money manager.
Analysts watching the market in its frenzied state the past three days were far from united on what they see ahead for stocks. "'Judging from the magnitude of the decline in the past three days, we would say the minimum drop we should be

But American Telephone, closely identified in investors* minds with the cash-intensive utility industry, ended with a loss of 1% at 53%.
Du Pont was among the few gainers in the components of the Dow industrial average, rising % to 42%. International Paper also gained, closing at 39%, up %. Gambling stocks continued weak, with Bally Manufacturing dropping % to 30% in active trading. Caesars World, also active. sUpped % to 16%.
Gold stocks ended mixed, with ASA dropping 1% to 30%. Campbell Red Lake rose % to 22%, and Dome Mines fell 2% to
40%.
On the American exchange, the market value index was off as much as 10.77 at one time but came back a bit to close at 212.65, off 7.50. Only 50 Amex stocks closed with gains; 768 declined.
Resorts International Class A stock headed the Amex actives, with 549,500 shares, closing at 29%, off %. The stock traded as low as 26% before rebounding.
Second most active on the Amex was Damson OU, which reported on natural-gas flows from production testing of a new well off-shore Cameroon; Damson dropped 1% to 20%. Some analysts found the results disappointing.
The National Association of Securities Dealers' Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks plummeted a further 5,89 pointe to close at 139.31. It had shed 5.78 pointe on Tuesday. Stocks declining in price overwhelmed gainers 1,835 to 60, and volume soared to a record 24,485,800 from Tuesday's prior record 22,126,600,	.
