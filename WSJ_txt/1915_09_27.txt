ACTIVE AND STRONG
Wall
Street expected «. -successful notation of ths Anglo-French loon, and proceeded to discount the etteeet according to its own ideas as to what that effect should be on the business of the country- Evidently it was taken for granted that stabilization of the exchange market, by facilitating payments for supplies, would produce a much greater effect on the war stocks and industrials generally than upon the railroad issues; and while the former became very active and strong, the latter showed the effect of realizing sales during the greater part of the day. Baldwin Locomotive was the most conspicuous feature of the advancing movement, its advance being based not so much on reports of the entrance of new interests in the property, as on the estimate made by lkjw, Jones & Co., and confirmed by a director of the concern, that the orders on hand and in prospect, mean earnings nearer to 150c^ than to 10fK; on the common stock. American Locomotive rose rapidly in sympathy with Baldwin, but met stock and soon lost the greater part of its advance. Republic Iron & Steel, Crucible Steel and Bethlehem Steel were very strong features, and United States Steel in the last hour advanced to a new high record for the year.
The strength of the market was put to a test a little before the close when announcement was made of the appointment of a receiver for Missouri. Kansas A: Texas. Naturally the news caused hurried selling by speculators, but the sales produced comparatively little effect, and th? undertone continued strong to the end of the day. Railroad issues were somewhat reactionary, and possibly the Missouri. Kansas & Texas matter produced an unfavorable influence on that department of the market. Public interest was larger than on any other day for many week* past, and some of the commission houses which advised custom ors to exercise con *ervati*m, or, account of the extent of the recent advance, said little attention was given to advice of that kind.
Transactions totaled 1.451.000 shares, which wa« within about 30,000 share* of tfie year’s high Tecord on April 19. At the end. advances greatly outnumbered decline* and were unusually large in many cases.
Large Attendance
Great activity was shown at the opening and gains were made all through the list. Attendance tn tho commission houses was very large, and sentiment wa- more optimistic than for a considerable time past. The successful offensive of the Allie* was considered a favoranle <ie-xelopmcnt from the market standpoint, and the Street expected announcement of successful completion of the Anglo-French loan in the near future.
The refusal of the du Pont interest* deny the report that win Locomotive, ami come associated with them in	.
a- a tacit admission of the truth of the story; stock opened on 1.800 shares from 109 to 101. < with 95at Saturday's close.
The copper stocks werf among the strong features. Ir Anaconda 5.600 shar« s were done at 74 and the next sale was at 74:-w, compared with 72at the close on Saturday. The rise reflected belief that completion rf the loan arrangenients xsould be followed by heavy purchases of copper by the' Allie*.	’
Westinghou-e. American Locomotive and Lackawanna Steel opened a point up, while* Colorado Fuel started at art advance of A4. Rumors of pending merger- seemed to receive considerable credence.
St. Paul wa* one ot the strongest of the railroad i-sues. gaming	bv opening at 89. It wa* said ex-
changes of view* among directors and large stockholders at the annual meeting on Saturday stimulated bull interest in the stock.

A large volume of realizing wa? met with rr. the opening advance, hut the increased demand from tne commission house* wa«? .-uflicicnt to take care » f the pre**ur«c of sale-, and stock- continued very active and strong to the end of the first half hour.
Industrial Alcohol and Distillers were among the strongest specialties. the rise in them being due tn th** insistent demand for alcohol from the manufacturers of explosive*.
Pennsylvania xva.- -omewhat le»> active than on Saturday. although there was a bullish sentiment on the stock, based on the reports of a ?>alc of the company’- holdmg.-m Pemisylvani? Steel and Cambria Steel, through which the railroad would obtain a large supply of cash
Tne expectation of an increase or the < entral Leather dividend t*» V. vs a- reflected in strength and activity tn the stock. It v.us -aid the change in the dividend basis might he made this fall bx th? declaration of V quarterly. The dividends are at present paid semi-annually and a

War News Helps -
The remarkabW change in the fortunes of war within ( the past few days, including a reverse for von Mackensen’s army in Russia, and the inauguration of a vigorous and j successful offensive by the. British and French on the t western front, gave the market the strongest kind of a , stimulus and afforded a chance to all to make a start on ' an even footing. There were no previous intimations, the , little bulls getting the news as early as the big ones. I Next to the phenomenal rise in Baldwin Locomotive, the activity and strength in Republic Iron & Steel furnished the chief feature of interest. That stock, on trans- > actions probably the greatest in its history, advanced over ■
5	pointe to a level above 52. Merger rumors were circu- j la ted; but in conservative quarters it was argued that the rise reflected belated recognition of the earnings which the company, as the largest producer of bars, is deriving from the big demand for shrapnel rounds.
_ Crucible Steel became one of the prominent features just before eleven o’clock, advancing with ease to a new high record. Reports that Mr. Schwab and associates have ' acquired a large interest in the company were persistently I reiterated.	f
Among the railroads. Southern Pacific and Union Pa- ' cific were notably strong, and Chicago & North Western, i <>n a few transactions, advanced I’.-s to 130.
Baldwin's Ri*<*	I
Bullish enthusiasm among the rank and file hardly ! knew bounds in the second hour, and commission hou?»e ’ customers were so excited that they boasted to one another , of their profits in tones loud enough to be heard by many others than the particular party to whom the remarks were ostensibly addressed. Thi.- hardly indicated careful , and conservative speculation.	i
Baldwin Locomotive was the «tar performer, advanc- i ing 16b_« points to 112. It was said ♦hat the earnings this j year will amount to nearly 30*3 on the stock, and that | from present indications the company at the close of j the year will have on hand Fuflldent busine-* to produce earnings of 200*7.	1
Bethlehem Steel made a new high record by advancing to 366. 10 point* up iron* Saturday’.- close, hut the preferred dropped back 3 point* to 165. Houses having among: their customers speculative holders of Bethlehem *say these could not be induced to sell at the present prices.
in connection with the advance in Lackaxxanna Steel it wa- stated in conservative quarters that the company i-now assured of earning* for tho present year and of about 25', for 1916.
A I’an-<‘ for Breadth
After a little pause for breath the market resumed itr advance about the middle of the afternoon, and seemed to be in oven *trongcr technical -position than at the opening. Tho realizing sales having been absorbed, there w;i-
6	smaller supply out of which the demand could bo met although this was still insistent.
The agricultural stock* like Virginia-Carolina Chemical. American Agricultural Chemical and American Co’ ton Oil. who.-e prosperity to a great extent depends upon condition.- m the South, responded to an optimistic interview obtained by J>ou. Jones A.- C<». from Henry Walters j who control.- the Atlantic Coast Lino-Loui.'viile & Nashville .-x.-tem. Men of long exj»eriencr cannot recall an instance in xxmeh Mr. Walters ovei before allowed hi« name to l>e used in connection with a published interview.
The railroad stock* eased off a little, hut sentiment or them was sti’J bullish in the more conservative commission houses, and tho hope was felt -that the public could be induced to turn attention from the industrials to 1 the standard rail*.
There was a t*ulli>h sentiment on United States Steel., and it was predicted that the -rock would *$ore a sub- ! slantial further advance before the present upward move- | ment reached its culmination.	,
Steel at New lligrh	j
V. S. Steel resumed the lead in th»» Lite afternoon ] and the general list math* a good response to its leadership. notwithstanding cvithncr of very heavy realizing in a numlwr of places. Professional traders said the par** was too fast and that a reaction was due. but the buying was of such a confident k»nd that it would probably tak** news of a seriously adver.-r nature to cause a substantial 1 setback.	.
A new high record was* made by American Can. when ! the stork -old up to 657-. Close observers said accumu- ; lation of that issue is in progress.	'
General Electric became active, and thc^e was a re- ! eurrence of rumors of a stock dividend.
