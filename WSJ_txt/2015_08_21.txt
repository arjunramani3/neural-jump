A wide variety of stocks, from technology to the energy sectors, were hammered in a Friday selloff, which dragged the Dow Jones Industrial Average into correction territory.
Technology stocks posted some of the biggest declines. Apple Inc. shares fell 6.1%, the biggest percentage drop among the 30 Dow components, to close at $105.76. The iPhone maker entered bear-market territory, after falling more than 20% from its $133 record high hit in February.
Netflix Inc. dropped 8% to $103.96.
The global market rout pummeled stocks and commodities as fresh evidence emerged that China's economy is slowing, spooking investors.
The market turmoil has many traders exercising caution.
"You have a situation that's tough to play," said Christopher Cady, a New York-based trader. He said he closed out bets toward the end of the week that U.S. stocks would fall. "Nimble . . . is the new black."
The Dow industrials lost 530.94 points, or 3.1%, to close at 16459.75, putting it in correction territory, as defined by a 10% decline from a recent high. The S&P 500 dropped 64.84 points, or 3.2%, to close at 1970.89. The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.5%, or 171.45 points, to 4706.04.
The Dow's more than 1,000-point drop this week was the largest weekly point decline since the week ended Oct. 10, 2008.
Stock volume was the highest since October, with 10.4 billion shares trading hands.
Signs of a sharp slowdown in the world's second-largest economy have unnerved investors since Beijing surprised markets last week by devaluing its currency. Shares in
the U.S., Asia and Europe have tumbled, along with commodity prices as investors fretted about waning Chinese demand just as supplies are surging.
An early gauge of China's factory activity fell to a six-and-a-half year low in August, heaping further pressure on stocks and commodities after Thursday's global selloff.
Industrial metals prices also fell as the Chinese data reignited worries about the future pace of demand from the world's top consumer.
"Now we've had some harder evidence that China is slowing relatively fast, people have chosen to get out," said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS Wealth Management, which oversees around $2 trillion of assets.
Energy stocks also plunged as a drop in crude-oil prices deepened. Marathon Petroleum Corp. shares plummeted 9.2% to 48.38. Chevron Corp fell 4.4% to 75.76.
Biotechnology stocks also suffered. Gilead Sciences dropped 6.3% to 105.33.
A surge in investor demand for assets considered safest during times of market stress sent the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds to 2.052%, its lowest level since April. Yields fall as bond prices rise.
Some investors and analysts say they think the tumult in the markets could complicate the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates.
Ultralow interest rates have fueled a big rally in stock markets since the financial crisis. On Wednesday, minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting showed officials were divided over when to raise rates, with some citing concerns over China's economy as a reason to hold back.
But a delay in lifting rates may bring little comfort to investors if slowing growth is underpinning the Fed's caution.
Paul O'Connor, a senior fund manager at Henderson Global Investors, which manages GBP 82 billion ($129 billion) in assets, said he has been selling stocks and buying bonds in recent months, fearing further spillover from the recent Chinese selloff.
"Is there a buying opportunity in stuff that has got beaten up, or will it start to erode confidence in developed market assets? We're in the latter camp," he said.
