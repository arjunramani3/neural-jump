I There was no particular change In the 1 complexion of the news Brokers, however. ; said that investors' confidence had been undermined by the failure of Government, management and labor to get production going atronglv a year after the end of the war There were a lot of stop orders executed yesterday , which, according to brokers, were based on . "sell orders" when the industrial average went through the February lows, confirming the new lows for the railroad average The difficult foreign situation was discounted as a factor in the decline since London markets, a close
barometer of foreign affairs, ruled firm
There were 548 new lows, the longest list tn many years Issues traded totaled 1.075

duration of the trend prior to the signal That is not always true, however In the spring ot 1939 there occurred, according to the Dow theory, a bear signal which was followed by only six more days of decline. One or two other examples can be found in which tne major trend so indicated lasted less time after the signal than before.
The market this year bears a curiously close resemblance to that of 1937--so close that it seems almost incredible that the likeness should continue. That would be a rare statistical accident, indeed, like the July temperature record m the environs ot New York, which almost exactly approximated the averages calculated by the Weather Bureau since it began keeping records In 1937. the averages made their highs in March, declinca into lune, recovered during the summer, weakened late in August and on Tuesday-after Labor Day the industiial average broke eight points. This year the fit st highs came Febiuary 5, the decline was short and the rally culminated in May-June The late sum-mci weakness and the break after Labor Dav were veiy similar. To complete the picture, the 1937 top m the industrials was 18 points below the 1946 top and in the tails it was only fou: points lowei, and at the close on the day after Labor Dav in 1937 the industrials were down 30 points, four less than this time, and the rails were down 20 points, four more than this time
