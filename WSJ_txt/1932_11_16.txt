Hesitancy in stocks was succeeded by distinct heaviness yesterday afternoon, and the list moved lower under a mild increase in selling pressure. Losses at the close ran to a maximum of about 4 points, with the market only fractionally above the day’s lows. The domestic bond list weakened with stocks. Government issues were strong throughout the session. Wheat travelled over a narrow range, closing fractionally lower. Swings in cotton were small, with the close up 3 to 6 points.
The day’s major business development was the declaration of the regular quarterly dividend by directors of American Telephone. The regular payment had been looked for in Wall Street, and it generated no enthusiasm. Telephone sold At 109 3/s just before the announcement, sold up to 110, and then sagged off again.
In the reaction at the start of the final hour, Telephone was the weakest stock on the list. It gave ground easily, sinking to 106%. off 4% from Tuesday’s close, and the ensuing rally carried it up to the close of 107%, off 3% on the day.
The rails were heavy from the opening gong. They have been depressed by the loadings statements of individual roads for the week ended November 12. all showing heavy declines in traffic from the previous week. The latest week includes the Election Day holiday, accounting in part for the severity of the decline. Atchison and Union Pacific both Closed off 2 points or more, and New York Central and Chesapeake & Ohio were heavy. Reconstruction Finance Corp, approval of the Baltimore & Ohio’s loan application failed to rouse the rails.
Union Carbide was the only important stock moving against the trend. It opened fractionally higher, and at one time was up close to 2 points. Among the minor stocks. Loft. Inc. was fractionally higher, with trading in the issue unusually heavy.
The other dividend naws appearing during the day was not unfavorable. Macy voted the regular quarterly cash payment, but omitted the usual stock dividend. International Salt and American Sugar Refining both voted the customary payments.
Steel operations, for the week ended Monday were estimated at a shade over 19rr of capacity by Dow-Jones, unchanged from the previous week. In the like 1931 week, operations sagged off about 1%.
A late recovery on the Paris bourse enabled stocks to regain some of the ground lost earlier. In London, the market was irregularly lower.
The Motors Outlook
There has been some accumulation of the motor shares on the theory that for a period of several weeks, news on the motor industry should be more favorable than it has over the past few months. The low point m production for 1932 probably was passed in October, when output was the lowest it has been since 1918
Since October, volume production of the new Plymouth models has gotten under way, starting at 1,000 cars daily, and later stepped up to 1.200 cars a day. By the close of the month. Chevrolet probably will have begun production of its new. models. Other companies soon will begin preparation for the big selling season, which opens with the New York Automobile Show’ in the second week of January.
Generally speaking, the mot jr industry is In good shape for the new season. The first sign of improvement for the industry came in the late summer, when retail business firmed up. The seasonal decline, in the early fall, was less than in cither 1930 or 1931.
Dealers’ stocks have been worked down substantially in the last few months. The better retail business experienced in the fall months took the motor industry by surprise, and production schedules were not changed to meet the improved demand. Dealers’ stocks, consequently. have been drawn on, and in some lines there actually is a shortage of cars at the present time.
One indication of the improved stock situation is that companies are announcing introduction of new models as much as six weeks ahead of their appearance on the market. If stocks of old models were heavy, no such announcements would be made.
Debt Positions
Senatorial replies to a questionnaire on individual positions in regard to debt revision or cancellation were hardly cheering to Wall Street. The large majority held to the view that debt payments must be made, although a number indicated that they would look more favorably on debt revision if foreign governments reduced armament expenditures.
In considering the Senators* statements. Wall Street should remember that, during the last two years, political leaders the world over again have reversed their positions on International financial problems, particularly when confronted with the possibility of extremely disagreeable situations.
Another 50-50 Plan
The Reconstruction Finance Corp- finally has come through with an order approving a loan of 331,625.000 to the Baltimore & Ohio to aid the road in anticipating its maturity of $63,250,000 convertible 43/£s, due March 1. The refinancing plan is another 50-50 proposal. The road is asking holders of the convertibles to take 50% in cash and 50% in refunding and general mortgage bonds. Substantially all the holders of the convertibles must accept if the plan is to be put through.
The requirement that substantially all the holders oi% the convertibles accept the offer is in line with, the stipulation made since the ex
perience in the potton Beit refinancing, when “holdouts” were paid in full. The Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Reconstruction Finance Corp., are determined that “hold outs” shall not be rewarded again.
Holders of the B. & O. convertibles have ample time in which to make up their minds on the plan, and the road will have plenty cf opportunity to urge that deposits of bonds be made. Bondholders must recognize that there is but one alternative to failure of the refinancing proposal.
It. F. C. Repayments
Some of the grey tinge to the financial skies was dispelled by the figures on bank repayments of Reconstruction Finance Corp, loans, which now total 27% of the amount advanced. The figure is a much higher percentage than for earlier periods, and reflects the marked improvement in the banking picture generally. The corporation also reported a marked decline in requests for Ioans from all classes of financial institutions in October.
Unless extended by Presidential order, the loaning life of the Reconstruction Finance Corp, will come to an end on January 22, next, just one year after the bill creating the corporation was signed by the President. The measure provides that the President by executive order can extend the corporation’s life for another year.
The Impending change of administration puts the whole question of extending the loaning life of the corporation somewhat up in the air. It certainly is a matter which calls for consultation between the President and the President-elect.
