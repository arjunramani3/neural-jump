ABREAST OF THE MARKET
Rv Rkatrtce E. Garcia
Disappointing news on the U.S. trade deficit and a sharp rise in interest rates dealt the stock market a crushing blow, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its biggest one-day point loss ever.
The industrial average plummeted 95.46 to 2412.70, a 3.8% fall. Yesterday’s drop surpassed the 91.55-point tumble it took Oct. 6. The decline surprised many market professionals because it appeared that the recent slide for stocks might be leveling off; the average had moved up more than 36 points Tuesday.
Some traders found minor consolation in the fact that yesterday’s fall wasn’t anywhere near the record 12.82% drop of Oct. 28, 1929, when the industrial average lost 38.33 points to close at 260.64.
“Everyone is shellshocked, including ourselves,” said Jack Baker, head of capital commitment at Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York. “The market was really surprised that the trade numbers didn’t show that much of an improvement.”
Before the market opened yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that •the August merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $15.68 billion from $16.47 billion in July. Economists surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report were looking for an average gap of about $15 billion; some market participants were expecting a gap as small as $13.5 billion. Rates in the bond market shot up on the news.
The industrial average has fallen 11.4% from its high of 2722.42 established Aug. 25. Although this fall hasn’t exceeded the correction in 1984, when the average dropped 15.6%, “this is a correction to be reckoned with," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman.
All 30 stocks making up the industrial average closed lower. Among the big losers were Merck, down 714 to 19114; Philip Morris, down 3% to 110%; Procter & Gamble, down 4% to 94; Exxon, down 2 to 47%; International Business Machines, down 3% to 14514; Bethlehem Steel, down 114 to 18, and Coca-Cola Co., down 3% to 4314.
The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index plunged 9.29 to 305.23 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index sank 4.76 to 171.26.
Big Board volume was 207.4 million shares.
So-called program traders were active yesterday, as they were during the big decline Oct. 6 and the Dow’s record one-day point gain of 75.23 points Sept. 22. But, as on these earlier days, traders said, investor sentiment rather than program trading appeared to be the principal factor driving the market. Program traders use computers to buy and sell market-representative baskets of stocks in strategies designed to capitalize on differences in their prices and the prices of futures and options on bellwether market indexes.
It’s hard to overstate the indiscriminate nature of yesterday's stock sell-off. Declining Big Board issues overwhelmed gainers by a 5-to-l margin. Normally, 3-to-l is considered an all-out rout. The volume of Big
Board issues rising in price yesterday was only 20 million shares, while the volume of the decliners was 181 million.
David Robin, manager of the futures and options department at Yamaichi International (America) Inc., said two big declines of more than 90 points “can’t be overlooked without making some serious decisions about where assets will be allocated.” He said U.S. and some Japanese investors were selling stock-index futures contracts as a way of hedging against the market decline or just to get out of an illiquid equity market quickly.
Shearson’s Mr. Sinai said the disappointment over the trade deficit news feeds fears of further weakness in the U.S. dollar, still higher rates and tighter .monetary policy. The stock market is extremely vulnerable because these factors make up the "recipe for the next recession,” he added.
Besides the general downturn in the market, there was negative news for holders of auto stocks. Total third-quarter profit for the Big Three auto makers may have dropped 27% because of an expected operating loss at General Motors and flat net at Ford Motor and Chrysler. Also, early-October car sales totaled 151,043, down from 247,623 a year earlier.
GM fell 2% to 73; Ford lost 314 to 92% and Chrysler sank 134 to 36; all three were actively traded.
Ogden Corp, was among the few gainers in yesterday’s market, moving up % to 34%. The company got a contract to build and operate a waste-to-energy plant in Union County, N.J., costing $107 million.
Deere rose 1% to 41 on more than 2.1 million shares. The company said it knew of no reason for the rise, but it told the Dow Jones News Service that a farm and construction equipment trade group released bullish sales figures yesterday.
CBS slid 714 to 211. Amid heavy market speculation that CBS was about to sell its record division to Sony Corp, of Japan, CBS chief Laurence A. Tisch is said to favor spinning off all or part of the unit because of certain tax advantages. CBS said late yesterday that it’s still studying plans for the record unit. The broadcaster also reported higher third-quarter operating earnings yesterday.
A number of companies that reported higher earnings ended up in the losers’ column anyway. Eli Lilly dropped 3% to 90; Transamerica fell % to 40%; Hospital Corp, of America lost.1% to 41%; Apple Computer dropped 114 to 5314; Pfizer declined 2 to 6.3'54, and RJR Nabisco slid 2% to 62.
But Huffy Corp, moved up % to 28% and Georgia-Pacific rose % to 42%. Both companies also reported higher quarterly earnings.	.
Colgate-Palmolive rose % to 47% after it agreed to sell its Kendall unit to International Paper. The consumer products concern said that it would have a pretax charge of $211 million in the third quarter as the result of its ongoing restructuring efforts.
Kansas City Southern Industries slipped 2% to 67%. Although a group led by Howard Kaskel, a New York real estate developer, has raised its stake in the company to 9.7% and suggested a friendly takeover, Kansas City Southern said it hasn’t received any merger offers.
