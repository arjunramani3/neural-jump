Abreast of the Market
By Victor J. hiijjhv
Speculation on a drop in crude oil prices and hopes ot progress in coal labor negotiations helped the stock market yesterday to bound ahead over a wide front. The Dow Janes industrial average spurted 25.50 points for its biggest gain in almost three weeks. Trading was moderately active.
Reports that Saudi Arabia is planning a unilateral reduction in the price of petroleum was a major factor in enabling the industrial average to start the session with a rise of more than seven points. It continued to climb almost steadily through the rest of the day, even though Saudi Arabian diplomats denied the price-cutting reports One Saudi official said that country still is hopeful of a modest "symbolic cut” of something less than 10% in world oil prices.
After retreating a total of 35.98 points in the previous five sessions, the industrial average closed yesterday at 659.34. Its advance was the sharpest since a 28 39-point jump Oct. 9. The transportation indicator also scored a big gain and the utility average was up, too.
Lawrence Lewis, Pershing & Co. partner, said several recent reports of a weakening economy "didn’t have much clout in fostering selling and traders were encouraged by this.”
These negative news items also were offset to some extent, brokers said, by the continuing slide of short-term interest rates. Another bank yesterday lowered its prime lending rate to 11% and a few more reduced their fees to 11%%
Much Cash on Sidelines
Citing the enormous amount of cash on the sidelines, Eldon A. Grimm, vice president of Birr, Wilson & Co., attributed some of the strength yesterday to buying by people who were “afraid of missing tlfe boat.”
Nicholas Davis, research partner at Boettcher & Co., contended that “the odds are the rally will carry to the 800 level, although we think there's a 25% chance the market later will fall back to or below its recent lows.” In addition to declining interest rates and cash on the sidelines, he said the market would benefit from "an improving international monetary picture ”
In the economic background was news that the index of leading business indicators last month fell 2.5%, its sharpest drop in more than 23 years.
Indicative of the wide sweep of the advance were the 1,030 New York Stock Exchange stocks that gained, almost three times the 351 losers. Issues touching new 1974 lows declined to 22 from 39 on Monday and eight stocks again reached new highs.
Big Board volume expanded to 15,610,000 shares from 10,540,000 Monday, when activity was reduced because of the observance of Veterans Day. The pickup in institutional activity was reflected in the rise in trades of 10,000 shares or more to 98 from the prior day’s revised total of 58.
The American Stock Exchange’s index climbed 1.12 to 68.54, and advances held a modest lead over losers. Trading quickened to 1,880,000 shares from 1,560,000 the day before. The National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ composite index also moved higher; it finished at 63.67, up 1.17.
In the over-the-counter bond market, prime corporates gained an average of about % point; long-term governments were up about 4-32 point.
Stocks in an uptrend on the Big Board yesterday included computer, oil, auto, airline, housing, chemical, copper, retail, drug, electronic, machinery, paper, steel, tobacco, and savings-and-loan issues. But golds, big gainers on Monday, were sharp losers.
Glamour stocks were exceptionally strong, due partly to short covering, or the buying of stock to replace borrowed shares sold earlier. International Business Machines sprinted 11 to 191%. Merck jumped 4% to 64%; Upjohn, 2 to 44%; Schering-Plough, 3% to 53%; Kresge, 2% to 23%;
