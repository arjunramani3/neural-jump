By Craig S. Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wai.i. Street Journal
NEW YORK-Stocks plunged again as traders rushed to dump shares before the close of trading.
The slide took the Dow Jones Industrial Average below the 2500 level, ending at 2483.42. down 76.73—its lowest close since July 1989.
Traders say no one wanted to go out of the market holding stock for fear that some event overnight could shrink values further.
The market opened on a downdraft, reacting to a plunge in share prices overseas. Tokyo stocks plummeted 5.8% Thursday. the fourth largest one-day point drop in the market’s history. The Dow Jones industrials lost more than 72 points in the first hour of trading.
Even the oil stocks fell, with some Issues tumbling back below their levels before Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, when oil was about $20 a barrel. Oil stocks, in the face of rising oil prices, have been resisting the market sell-off. Crude oil futures yesterday rose to $31.93.
Investors couldn’t blame program trading for the day’s sell off.
Lazslo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, says there was no evidence of program selling in the final hour of trading when the industrial average plunged an additional 40 points.
The New York Stock Exchange’s "uptick’ ' rule, which restricts program trading when the Dow Jones industrials fall 50 points, went into effect at 9:54 a.m. EDT, remaining in effect for the rest of the trading day.
Standard & Poor’s 500-Stock Index dropped 9.49 to 307.06, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 5.34 to 168.88, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index lost 7.79 points to 285.31.
Only 148 stocks advanced, while 1,645 stocks fell and 242 stocks ended unchanged.
New York Stock Exchange volume surged to 250,440,000 shares-brlnging the heaviest day of trading since market players awoke Aug. 2 to the news that Iraq had Invaded Kuwait. Wednesday, 175,550,000 shares were traded.
Paul Hennessey, vice president of trading at Boston Co., said some traders had picked up stocks earlier In the day hoping for a late session bounce. But when no bounce materialized, those who held stock rushed to sell before the close.
The steep sell-off leaves the market in a position to rebound early today If there is no bad news overnight, Mr. Hennessey says. But with the reluctance among traders to hold stock over the weekend, today’s session could prove to be equally volatile.	’
Among the big oil stocks, Exxon gave back 1% to 49%. Chevron lost 3 to 75%, Amoco dropped 1% to 55% and Mobil lost 2% to 62%.
While analysts continue to consider the energy sector one of the safest havens within the stock market, they say Investors
looking to buy now should pick their stocks with care.
Bernard J. Picchi, oil analyst at Salomon Brothers, cautions that many of the major oil companies have reached priceearnings valuations well above their peaks during the last oil-price surge of 1979-1980 when oil reached S40 a barrel. And many of those companies are now more dependent on Income from their chemical businesses than they were back then, he says.
Higher oil prices are likely to squeeze the profits of petrochemical and plastics operations. Mr. Picchi says, while a general economic downturn could hurt the markets for those products in general.
"In 1980. almost no one I of the major oil companies I was making money from chemicals, while last year, chemicals contributed about 16% to the income of the nine largest oil companies." Mr. Picchi says.
He is recommending a handful of major oil companies and refiners that could manage real gains, or will at least fall less than other stocks.
Atlantic Richfield and Texaco are Mr. Picchi’s picks, which he says are still cheap relative to other oil stocks and have less exposure to the chemicals business.
He also likes refiners Diamond Shamrock, Ashland Oil and Valero Energy, pointing out that they are likely to benefit from diminished refining capacity around the world in the wake of the Middle East turmoil.
Mr. Picchi estimates that the world has already lost about 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day of refined products such as gasoline, kerosene and home-heating oil because of the embargo against Kuwaiti and Iraqi production.
Meanwhile. U.S. refineries are operating at about 95% of their capacity, he says.
“The bottom line is that we are probably going to see higher profit margins in refining for a longer period of time than we would have thought possible before," he says.
Texaco fell 3% to 60’4, while Atlantic Richfield rose % to 138%. Diamond Shamrock lost % to 21’4, Ashland Oil fell % to 31%. and Valero Energy slipped % to 15.
Eli Lilly slid 2 to 68%, leading the most active list on volume of more than 4.6 million shares. Medtronic said the U.S. Court of Appeals vacated a lower court finding that Medtronic Infringed patents held by Eli Lilly. Medtronic fell 1% to 74%.
Insurance and financial services provider Transamerica tumbled 3%. or nearly 11%, to 30 on volume of more than 1.8 million shares. The company said it couldn’t explain why Its stock has fallen further than the rest of the market. The company said It still expects to report a strong year.
The Federal National Mortgage Association lost only % to 26% on volume of more than 3.6 million shares. Fannie Mae's announcement that it will buy back as much as $500 million of its common stock and warrants lent support to Its share price.
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 8.54 to 315.85. Volume rose to 24)850,000 shares, compared with 16,570,000 shares Wednesday.
