Inktomi, already trading in the single digits after its recent selloff, the $191-a-share price of last April a distant memory, fell another $3.43 to finish at a paltry $2.79 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The slide came after the Foster City, Calif., provider of Internet-infrastructure hardware warned that losses for its fiscal second quarter will be wider than previously forecast, because of worsening conditions in the Internet-gear market.
The fallout in the software sector proved to be indiscriminate. Veritas Software dropped 7.51 to 39.89, reaching a 52-week low on Nasdaq. Siebel Systems shed 5.65 to 23, which set a 52-week low.
Sycamore Networks dropped 1.63 to 7.41 on Nasdaq, falling to a 52-week low. Lehman Brothers cut its rating on shares of the Chelmsford, Mass., maker of fiber-optic networking products, citing expectations of lingering weakness among the service providers that deploy its equipment.

NEW YORK -- Stock prices skidded sharply as investors came to believe that previous pessimism hadn't fully captured how dismal corporate profits may turn out to be this year.
Inktomi, already trading in the single digits after its recent selloff, the $191-a-share price of last April a distant memory, fell another $3.43 to finish at a paltry $2.79 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The slide came after the Foster City, Calif., provider of Internet-infrastructure hardware warned that losses for its fiscal second quarter will be wider than previously forecast, because of worsening conditions in the Internet-gear market.
Redback Networks, a networking-hardware maker, fell 1.93 to 9.77 on Nasdaq, dropping to a 52-week low, after it warned it was going to come up short of quarterly estimates.
Compounding the problems, companies that owned up to profit shortfalls couldn't promise when their businesses might turn around.
Shares of Internet-software developer BroadVision dropped 1.53 to 2.97 on Nasdaq, after the company startled investors and analysts with the scope of the slump it projected in its first-quarter revenue totals.
"I can't believe that anybody can be disappointed with the outlook for technology earnings," said Tony Cecin, head of equity trading at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "But what's disappointed investors today is the magnitude of the shortfalls in revenues and earnings," Mr. Cecin added.
Other technology names also took the confessional path in what proved one of the most warning-laden trading days of recent memory. Documentum fell 1.53 to 8, E.piphany shed 2.47 to 7.28, and National Instruments gave up 2.56 to 29.06, all on Nasdaq. All were one-time highfliers that finished the session at a fraction of their highest trading levels.
The Nasdaq Composite Index closed the trading session with its 11th-worst one-day percentage loss, falling 6.17%, its worst one-day loss since its record-setting 14.17% decline Jan. 3. The index fell 109.97 points, closing at 1673.00, its lowest finish this year, as well as its lowest since Oct. 10, 1998.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up a lot of ground itself, falling 3% or 292.22, to close at 9485.71.
Among components of the industrial average, the selling started in the technology names, then spread out to infect almost every sector. In fact, only one of the 30 components finished in the black: Home Depot. It gained five cents to 42.60.
International Business Machines fell 4.27 to 90.39, while Microsoft declined 2.44 to 53.38 on Nasdaq, and AT&T dropped 1.04 to 20.04 on its exposure to technology.
As the selloff broadened, it snared financial stocks, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, which fell 3 to 41.60, Citigroup, which slipped 2 to 43.70, and American Express, which declined another 1.72 to 37.99, after having surrendered 4% Monday on an earnings warning of its own.
Growth stocks, such as retailer Wal-Mart Stores, which slid 1.45 to 49.19, drug maker Merck, which tumbled 1.44 to 72.81, and General Electric, which fell 2.12 to 39.68, also faded sharply.
Economically sensitive cyclical stocks, such as manufacturers Caterpillar, down 2.28 to 42.16, and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, off 2.14 to 99.91, also traded lower on the session.
But the losses really mounted most spectacularly in the technology and telecom sectors, where analysts talked with unfettered pessimism about how bad conditions really were, and how long they would stay that way.
Analysts went at Ariba with hammers and tongs. The most highly regarded of business-to-business Internet stocks, and the first to be able to tout its turn into profitable operations, the company admitted late Monday it was caught in a sizable earnings shortfall. Analysts threw in the towel in droves. The stock traded down 2.09 to 4.44 on Nasdaq, sliding to another 52-week low.

Telecommunications-equipment providers, hurt by hesitation about the outlook for capital expenditures, also fell sharply. In a research note, Lehman Brothers said that, while telecom-service providers might start to enjoy some improved fundamentals, capital spending is going to remain weak.
Ciena shed 6.75 to 35.69 on Nasdaq, while Nortel Networks gave up 1.10 to 12.88, and Corning dropped 1.40 to 18.50, falling to a 52-week low.
Sycamore Networks dropped 1.63 to 7.41 on Nasdaq, falling to a 52-week low. Lehman Brothers cut its rating on shares of the Chelmsford, Mass., maker of fiber-optic networking products, citing expectations of lingering weakness among the service providers that deploy its equipment.
Chips stocks weakened on a pessimistic call about the sector from Piper Jaffray. Advanced Micro Devices fell 1.82 to 23.68, while Analog Devices declined 1.78 to 31.
