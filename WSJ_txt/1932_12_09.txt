in the stocks
New life came into the stock market final hour of trading yesterday and pushed forward again into new high ground for the current recovery movement. For the fifth consecutive day, the Dow-Jones industrial and railroad stock averages moved forward. Gains in leading stocks ran to as much as 3 points, but they were limited generally to ^between 1 and 2.
Bonds, too, were firm, extending the recovery movement. It was the fourth successive session in which the Dow-Jones average of 40 domestic corporation issues has gained. The commodity markets, too, gave a good performance. Wheat closed about unchanged, but cotton ran up 16 to IS points.
One factor in the late recovery was the news from Washington that prospects were bright for a favorable report from the House Ways and Means Committee on beer legislation. Another was the constructive interpretation placed on the notes to France and England in regard to war debt payments.
Irregularity at First
Stocks were irregular during the morning, and fractional losses were the rule at the end of the morning. The market was a dull affair, active issues swinging in a narrow range and doing very little.
Outright weakness in United States Steel preferred and heaviness in Steel common were factors in the morning hesitancy. Steel preferred sold down to 62 off more than 2 points, before support was met. In the late uprush, it rallied sharply and closed fractionally higher on the day.	_
Rail stocks met support on the reaction. Union Pacific was a leader in the late rise, gaining 3Vh on the day. New York Central and Chesapeake & Ohio common were late leaders. Allied Chemical was a strong spot all day, and finished^ixp
’The’ Berlin beferse was the feature of the markets abroad. The forward movement in prices there continued, although at a slower pace. In London the market was irregular, while in Paris weakness cropped out after the recent display of strength. Sterling did very little during the day, but closed a trifle higher.
Telephone Losses
The report that losses of instruments by American Telephone in November continued at more than 100,000 did not have a dampening effect on the market for the stock at the opening of trading. The report that the drop in November amounted to 102,000 telephones was offset somewhat by the company’s report to the Interstate Commerce Commission, covering Jong lines business m October. The latter showed a further narrowing of the gap between monthly operating income m comparison with the similar 1931 months- -
Since June, these comparisons have been growing steadily better. Operating income m June was 59% under that of June, 1931; in July, it was off 46%; in August, 41%; in September, 33%, and in October, 32%. This year, operating income in October, from long lines business, was more than 50% greater than in June. In October, 1931, operating income was about 8% less than in June.
The figures are encouraging only from the point of view that they show a further reduction in operating costs by the company. The 50% increase in operating income in October, over June, was achieved despite the fact October gross was slightly under the June level.
Stability in Oils
In the last nine months, every time a general threat to the price structure of the oil industry has arisen, steps have been taken to avoid a break in the structure. So far, these steps have been successful. While the industry is in a period of declining consumption of refined products, crude oil prices still are at a level which afford a profit for producers. The industry, since early this year, has been stabilized, through its own efforts aided in some cases *by state regulatory action.
The latest curtailment of production, has fixed dally output for Texas at 797,745 barrels, against actual production, in the week ended December 3, of around 900,000 barrels. The commission’s orders, in view of recent production figures, is a drastic downward revision. If •the oil industry wants to maintain the stability which haa characterized it recently, actual Texas production must be brought Into line with the commission’s recent order.
Helping General Electric Holders
General Electric holders are getting, in the distribution of the company’s Radio Corp, common holdings, a substantial dividend, based on General Electric’s current selling price. With Radio common at 5, the distribution amounts to about 83 cents a share on each share of General Electric, or a little more than 5% on the present market value of General Electric common. It does not aproach In value the Electric Bond & Share distribution, made some years ago, but it is manna in a lean year like 1932.
The Brokers’ Loans Advance
A prime influence In the big upswing In brokers’ loans, reported in the latest bank statement. was borrowing by houses in advance of the December 15 treasury financing. These houses have been purchasers of maturing obligations, which will be converted into new Issues, the latter to he disposed of to ultimate buyers at what the institutions hope will be a profit. The effect on brokers loans is temporary.
