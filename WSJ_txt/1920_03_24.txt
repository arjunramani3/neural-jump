THE STOCK MARKET
Ilijrher rates for call money result in a break in most of the recent industrial leaders—General Motors off 44 points from tlie lilg-h of the morning Xvhilc the reaction iu Crucible amounts to 20 points—Stutz holds up well—Sterling Exchange strong.
*	Sales, 1,751,000 shares.
Tho market had its first real reaction since Feb. 25. A strong bear crowd had been feeling around for an opening for a raid for several days, but had no real opportunity to cause much damage until yesterday when the call money rates wcreTidvanced to 14%. Of course,under normal conditions a 14% money rate .would not be a particularly bearish factor, but with a steady advance in prices covering nearly a month’s time stocks were naturally in a somewhat vulnerable position.
Tho high priced industrial issues were naturally the hardest hit and General Motors broke 44 points. The reaction in Crucible Steel amounted to 20 points and other speculative favorites reacted all the way from 3 points to S points. Many commission houses have been talking reaction for the last ten days.
Higher Prices at Opening -
Industrials continued to show an advancing tendency, and the opening prices were practically _ all above the previous close. Crucible Steel, in which a new short interest had been built up, was the feature, the opening salo being at 250, up 7% points. On subsequent sales it quickly Tan up to 254. This latter price is within seven points of the record high. General Motors was up 5% points at 405, and this price was within four points of the record figure. The General Motors certificates made a new high since trading started in them on the Stock Exchange at 40%, up %.
In the oil group, Sinclair gained % to 43 J4, and Texas Co. was up % at 215. Pan-American had little difficulty keeping a position above 103.
Waldorf Crowd Bearish on General Motors
After making an early high at 406 General Motors reacted 7 points and the certificates got under 40. Morning newspaper accounts stated that it was easier to borrow General Motors late Tuesday afternoon than it was earlier in the day when the certificates were loaning flat. Traders saw in these announcements a possibility that the shorts had pretty well covered their stocks and figured that temporarily at least it was in a somewhat vulnerable position. The Waldorf crowd still insists that the developments of today’s meeting of directors will not justify a price of $400 for the stock. Directors of the company have Little to say, but downtown banking interests are as confident as ever that tlie dividend increase and other announcements will easily account for the present selling price.
White Motors May Increase Dividend to $6
Other motor stocks acted somewhat better than General Motors. The activity in White Motors has been based on the belief that stockholders will be favored with either an increase in the $4 annual dividend to $6 a share or a substantial stock dividend in the coarse of the next few months. Predictions are made that 1920 will be a~record year. The compuny has doubled its capacity for turning out on and two-ton trucks, and it is estimated that 80% of the business now being handled is in the lighter truck. The report for 1919 is expected to show that the company is well intrenched with working capital. Interests conversant with the affairs of the company say the property is worth well in excess of what it is carried at on the
balance sheet, and that this may form a basis for recapitalization. Recent buying of Maxwell has been by the inside interests who are thoroughly familiar with the company’s earnings. According to a banker in dose touch with Maxwell affairs earnings are running far in excess of the most optimistic estimates.
General Motors and Certificates at New Record Highs
After the early dip to 399 the General Motors crowd once more put in big buying .orders and the stock shot up to 410, which constitutes'a new record high. The certificates touched 41%, which is above the old record price of 41 made on the Curb several months ago.
Remington Typewriter Issues Surprising Report
Remington Typewriter gained over a point following the publication of the annual report which showed $21.48 a share for the common after taxes and preferred dividends. Recent most optimistic forecasts had been for $18 a share, so that the figures as finally given out caused something of a surprise. On the basis of results over the first two months of the current year Remington should do considerably better in 1920 than in 1919.
Noon Time Raiding Time Again
The market was raided around noon following an advance in the call money rate to 8%. General Motors broke 25 points to 385. The break was accelerated by the catching of a lot of stop orders by people who had big paper profits and desired to protect at least part of them. During the reaction the oil stocks held up comparatively well. Shortly before the break Pan-American had established a new high for the year at 106 .and Mexican Petroleum had advanced to 206.
Stutz Swims Against Current
The one stock that failed to give way was Stutz Motors which actually shot up to a new-high at 248. This figure was made at the time General Motors was at its low figure of the day. The shorts seemed to be locked in Stutz even more securely than they were in General Motors.
Call Money Advances to 10%
The call money rate was advanced to 10% around 1:30 which resulted in further professional selling of stocks. General Motors was off nearly 30 points from the high and Crucible close to 20 points. Pan-American reacted 5 points.
Bank Borrowings
The banks are said to have been rediscounting rather heavily at the Federal Reserve Bank this week, some institutions having borrowed unusually large lines. Last week they reduced their commitments at the Reserve Bank to the extent of $64,000,000, due to the paying off of tax certificates by the Treasury. But the Government has been withdrawing the proceeds of tax collections temporarily placed in the banks, and the continued commercial demands have compelled them to have recourse again to the rediscount counter. This procedure is nothing new, since, on the occasions of tax payments last year, the coincident paying off of certificates caused a contraction of rediscounts, only to be followed immediately by renewed expansion ir. borrowing.
New Lows During Final Dealings
Practically the entire industrial list made new lows for the day during the last half hour. The break in General Motors and Crucible were the largest, although Texas Co. sold off 15 points from the high of the morning. The reaction in Baldwin Locomotive amounted to 13% points. In connection with the break, rumors were current that the Federal Reserve Board plan to assume control of all borrowings to be used for speculative purposes. In well informed quarters these reports were discredited.
