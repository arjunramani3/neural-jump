FEATURES OF THE MARKET.
STOCKS SHOW THE BEST RALLY IN WEEKS.
ing. as compared with active days of the recent past. It is noteworthy that‘three of the five most active stocks were industrials.
Action of the nankeen Clearing House Restores Confidence —General Advance of From 2 to 4 Points____________
Heavy Covering of Shorts and a Better Sentiment—Profit Taking Sales H’eZZ Absorbed.
Monday's Rango of Prices. ,
Prom the opening the market showed a better tone. London had sent a very substantial list, of advances and was moreover buying stocks in quantity. The first quotatons yero. In seme cases, as much as two points above baturday s close, and before midday this showing had been improved upon. The governing factor in the movement nas the general feeling of relief at the action taken by the an -ers Clearing House, eliminating sneculativo interests from the control of banks, where such banks had been used tall-' about	ria 1?S', Tkc Street is accustomed to
•ire an ont^ l •	banks and Morgan banks, but they
-rolled bv. m ■d r,c''e"t Proposition to institutions con-ma oritv‘h. s tnJbr,«y °f ‘5° Stock °nly'	‘•‘ven that
majority has to be financed, and where the depositor has no absolute confidence in the financial stability of the co'n-smal|ntr-idtOl"-St'h The r?adiness of shorts to cover and small tradcis a. buy on the elimination of this factor is a needed lesson for Wall Street. The public has grown to believe lately that it is not getting a square deal here, and ceitamly unfair financial methods are j’ust the thing to confirm such an impression. There seems to be plenty of investment money and plenty of small speculators willing show -hZeaS""a ahances’ lmt the day’s developments ■show ,he.v win not tolerate a market where they think t nc\ arc conceding something more than the fair dealer’s percentage. The market rallied throughout the day, checking a little in the last hour, but still maintaining a substantial amount of its recovery. There was an obvious movement to cover shorts which became quite marked when the usual selling by traders to even up after the advance developed Taken all round the rally was the best in a considerable period.
, lunong the railroad stocks Union Pacific pained over .our points Southern Pacific. Northern Pacific. Canadian I acific. and less active issues three points or more, and practically everything else from one to two points. There were no declines of consequence.
The industrials were equally strong with advances of five points in Smelters, four each in the preferred and National Lead, three points in the copper stocks and Steel preferred, and two points in Steel common. The tractions were strong with the exception of Interborough-JIetropoli-tan issues, which lost ground.	*
Commission houses very generally reported that their customers regarded the action of the Clearing House as the one thing needed to cut out the weak spot of the Street position. Ilujy found a real disposition to buy and erne-cially to rover shorts.	’
The first sale of American Smelting was only 190 shares, but was three points above tlie closing price of the previous day. The position in thal stock is decidedly better technically. One improving feature which is apt to b»’ overlooked is the rallying tendency of bar silver. ' It is understood also thal the weakest members of the Guggenheim interest have been liquidated.	.
Specialists reported that the early buying showed the larger financial interests were taking hold of stocks and rallying them very much as they used to do in the days when the larger financial interests were unhun bv a long decline. Traders attached importance to the buying of Union Pacific by Harriman & Co. and houses with‘similar affiliations.

A house which.used to do a good deal of confidential C"''”'. z	■	•	-	-	-
was a seller of Union Pacific and U. S. Steel' common on vhe opening strength. The stock was not pressed for sale, but there seemed a good deal of. it. It was proabbly responsible for the .first check in the rally in Union Pacific and the other market leaders.
It is understood that one of the conditions of the adjustment of the banking situation is chat a number, of loans made by individuals having, direcLdnlluenceiaWith-oanks taaen case t»T by the Clearing House have to be vnken up at once and this involves liquidation? Som^ peo-Pie think the market.jglbcin^lietep^^IitoU
White London was a very’fair buyer of United States ‘	h>* s- N- Wanen & Co. and other houses
wHh banking affiliations looked< rather good. It should be reniemoeie.i, however.-that Steel common is a stock H.r which taere is always a market, and this is more than can be said for many more pretentious issues.
. .	?’ork c,*-ntr:l5 was an exception to the-general
strcngui. nut apparently specialists had been pretiv well prepared for the decline. It is understood, that. p. substantial loan, in which, tluit stock -formed the collateral, had to be liquidated. The support in tlie generalmarket was devoted to what are technically more important stocks so far as their influence upon Street sentiment is concerned.	'	'
The belief that the Standard Oil interest was not cooperating in the support of the market was contradicted by some purchases of Union Pacific, Reading and Northern Pacific by brokers who usually get their orders from that source, when No. 26 Broadway is. willing to let the Street i know what it is doing.	!
Perhaps the most significant selling of ’ American ^melting was la.900 shares by A. Eckstein, the specialist, i It will be remembered that he put out something like' 5t),0(»0 shares in the latter part of last week and has been distributing what seems to be long stock for some time; past.
It was evident that on any hesitation in the market active traders were willing enough to test tlie strength of the rally. J. .1. Manning traded on both sides of Amalgamated Copper, but sold more than he bought, and C. B. Macdonald, who is fairly typical of the active floor operator changed his position very quickly.
London, was a very important support to the market, and did a good deal to sustain the forenoon rally. It is ' estimated that tho foreign buying totaled at least 49.000 share:-, well distributed, but including United States Steel in considerable quantity.
Probably the best feature of the London market was that some of the,still necessary liquidation for New York was accomplished on the other side, without causing a change of sentiment there. The feeling in London ’has been practically that some undisclosed unsoundness had been hanging over this market, and that by the time it was made public there would be good evidence that the situation was well in hand. This, of course, amounts to the local theory that stocks arc a purchase when the bad news is out
C. D. Barnes* & Co. were prominent among the afternoon buyers of U. S. Steel common. It i-; worth noting that this stock after a slow but severe decline, in whieh wai touched, recovered nearly two points in one day. This i? the most considerable single inou-ment it has made sin re it sold at 30.
J. W. Davis & Co. were important buyers of Union Pacific, taking a largo amount of that stock in the course of the day. Traders regarded this as -very good buying but said it was not better than that in the other market leaders. There seemed less selling of stock, presumably bought to protect the market, than might have been expected on such a rally. ■
On the moderate recession of tho early afternoon arbitrage houses bought stocks, taking a position on the long side over -night for the first time in a considerable period. The London settlement dots nob begin for a week, and reassuring developments here seem to be all the foreign markets have been asking for.
In the loan crowd the general rate was 6 per cent., but a number of active issues loaned below that figure, including St. Paul at 4 par cent., Reading and Steel preferred at 2 per cent’., Pennsylvania, New York Centra!, and Canadian Pacific flat, and less active issues in more or less special demand. The high rate was due to the tightening of the money market, but there was a strong demand for stocks.
In an active day’s trading Reading and Union Pacific, which were the market leaders, made up 52 per cent, of the business and with Smellers, Amalgamated Copper, and Steel common, active in the order named, 63 per cent, of the total trading. This does not indicate a remarkable degree of general activity, although nine other stocks exceeded 10,000 shares, which makes a fairly good show-
