Losses Range to 10 Points As New Selling Exhausts Demand, Strands List Near Lo ws
Repeated selling waves convulsed stocks again yesterday as the market fell victim to its own nerves, Losses for leaders ‘ranged to more than 10 points and industrials on the average were down 7.96 to their lowest point since April 1. Railroads withstood the savage thrusts better than other groups but carrier shares were off 1.86 to a new closing low since December 27, 1949. A net 1.49 was cut from the utility average, however, and this index was lower as trading concluded than at any time since last December 9. '	.
While well under the totals on Monday's and Tuesday's declines, volume totaled 3,040,000 shares. This was 440,000 greater than j was generated during the brief respite sellers I gave the market Wednesday. Statistically, ' the session was little different from Monday’s, which bore the first shock of investment re- ; action to outbreak of war in Korea. Advances numbered 73, compared with 59 the first day this week, 1.015 declines compared with 1,124, and nvw lows outweighed new highs, 191 to 2. compared with 128 to 8 Monday and 296 to 5 Tuesday.
-After an uncertain opening, offerings overpowered demand for the first time at 10:25. The tape did not catch up to floor transactions from then until 11.08. .Prices went under a second time at 12:23 and it was 1:16 before buyers again had the upper hand. Rallies after each of these bursts of liquidation were inconsequential, however, and the Stock Exchange’s reporting system again proved inadequate to handle the rapidity of sales eight minutes before the close. The tape still was three minutes late at the final bell.	'	.
■ A sharp set-back was suffered by Allied Chemical; off 10’i. Other major losses were recorded In Peoples Gas, down 7, Nickel Plat-% off 4?* and Gene)a) Motors, down 4* J,. Only Atlantic Coast Line,’ up %, and Delaware «fe Hudson, up were able to end higher among the 65 stocks, making up the major averages. At their closing levels last night, industrials were wlthL) 0.61 of having retraced one-third of their 66.78 rise from June 13, 1949 to June 12, 1950 and railroads had ’accomplished a minimum “correction" of their similar rise of 15.93 points with 0.41 to spare.
Heard on the Street—
Net ton miles per loaded car mile on the Norfolk »V Western for the month of May wer«* 46.5 compared with 49.8 for May, 1949. • • • While brokers feel Allh-Chaliuers may not earn as much this year as the $6.99 a share for 1949, they believe the net will provide a wide coverage of the $2 annual dividend. • • • Those interested in Cnmbitstion Engineering-Stiperheater say the backlog of orders Is holding around $80 million, which these sources consider sufficient to keep the company operating At a high rate well into 1951. • • With current earnings reported to be at an annual rate of between $8 and $10 a share, brokers are estimating that about $7 a share will be reported by Klng-Srclcy Corp, for the fiscal year to end July 31. • • • West Virginia Water Service Co. added 1,299 new customers in the first five months' of 1950. About 90% of the firm’s gross revenues come from domestic consumers, the remainder from industrial. • • • Recent interest in American Potash is said to reflect brokers’ belief that n sharp upturn In earnings may make an increase In the 50-cent dividend possible. • • • Operating revenues of Associated Transport in May arc believed to have been close to $3 million, compared with little more than $2 million in the like 1949 month. On last month’s business the firm is believed to have netted nearly a quarter million dollars, against around $35,000 in May, 1949. Earnings for the first five months this year arc understood to have totaled more than $950,000 compared with about $325,000 In the like period of last year. Earned surplus is said to have grown to close to $2 million.’ At the end of May 1949, there was an earned surplus deficit. • • • “On May 31," according to Distributors Group. Inc., “only 17.4% of the listed common stocks were selling above their 1916 highs; 82.6% were selling below, many of them substantially under the peaks.of four years Ago.” • • • American Airlines is doing a bigger and more profitable business in June than in May and operating income is running ahead of n year ago. Net after taxes, however, for the first six months of 1950 may be behind a. year Ago owing to credits which were available last year and effects of the strike earlier this year.

Market Views— •
•	. SAld N. Leonard Jarvis. of Hayden. Stone & Co.: “It is believed ‘hot Interchemical Corp, .may have earned between ,$1.30 and $1.40 a share in the second quarter, bringing first half net to around $2.50 a share, compared with 84 cents in the first six .months of 1949. This suggests the possibility of a 1950 net between $4.50 and $5 n share. If this level were achieved, a sizable extra might be paid nnd there is a possibility that the regular rate would be increased as well."

& Co.: “While the immediate cause of the stock market’s collapse was the Korean slim-tlon, it is doubtful that the selling would have attained the proportions it did had not the market been so vulnerable on other scores. Its- chief vulnerability, of course, was its uninterrupted rise of more than a, year during which time the amount ot stock bought on margin doubled. Then, too, the market’s advance of the past year had made a fairly liberal discount of Improved business. Whether the bull market which began in 1919 has come to a premature end Is the important question. We doubt that it nas, but think It very likely that one phase of it has passed

Oil and the Mexican TraCe Treaty—
American oil companies importing oil into the United States probably will be harmed only mildly, if at all. by termination of the-Mexican trade treaty. The treaty was recently abrogated by both the Mexican and United Stales Governments and it will expire December 31. 1950. After that time taxes on the importation of oil from all countries will be determined by the regulations of a previous trade agreement made with Venezuela. The present tax on imported oil, under the Mexican agreement, is 10’/i cents a barrel. The Venezuelan agreement regulations will impose the following taxes on imported oil: Imports that exceed an amount equal to 5% of the U. S. domestic refinery runs ot the previous I2-month period will be subject to a tax of 21 cents a barrel. The first 5% amount will pay a levy tho sanu as under the Mexican treaty. 10 cents a barrel.
The question of who will pay the additional 10’i cents a barrel levy, ultimately, has not been defined. But it is estimated that Creole

A Stock Market Appraisal—
The Korean cmbrogllo enught Wall by surprise and caused widespread liquida-
tion both by Investors and traders. It found the market at the highest point since 1930, so far as the industrial average was concerned, and with the largest volume of margin trading since before the war. At the moment, technicinns contend, the market is ruled by emotionalism and international news and not by economic facts. These observers suggest that sooner or later, as tho picture unrolls, calmer considerations will come into play and values will reassert themselves.
So far ns the chartists are concerned, and they take only figures into consideration, the industrial average could ictrcat to the 195-200 level without disturbing the main upward trend. However, with the cold war turned into a hot one, brokers arc loath to advise anything but nn extremely cautious altitude in making new long commitments, except perhaps during heavy selling waves. Brokers report that the public has been anxious to buy investment stocks which have shown sharp declines. Meanwhile the speculative position has been greatly improved with the liquidation ot many margin [ accounts. One broker said that 50% of nisi	.	....	.... ......

Some shorts have covered on weak spots* but the short interest remains little changed, say brokers. The shorts as a rule had large losses accruing and the week's decline, savage as it has been, Has whetted the Appetite of the bears for. bigger and hotter declines. ■
Obviously, the rhythm of the market has been rudely shocked. The confidence of investors and traders, built up by a year of uninterrupted advances, particularly in industrials. hA« been shaken. Even if the nows becomes more comfortable, technicians say, it will take some time to get the market on an oven keel, with the usual economic factors Again paramount.
Thus fAr, snid one veteran trader, earnings and dividends arc as good as they were a few days ago, but the international situation Is so fluid that It can easily bring reverberations into the domestic picture.

National Fuel Gas Co.—

This compares with 11’49 profits of $3,340,714. or 88 cents a common share on 3,810.183 shares outstanding, and earnings totaling $3,849,432. or $1.01 a share, for the 12 months ended March 31, 1950, First quarter net was $2,181,927 or 57 cents a share, against $1,673,- : 212 or 44 cents a share in the firnt three | months of 1949. According to Mr. Brown, second quarter sales this year arc 15% to 20% ahead of the corresponding 1949 period. Operating revenues for the 1? months ended March 31 were $32,090,724, compared with $27,984,561 for tho previous 12 months. In 1949 the company paid 60 cents a share in dividends.	' • .

Scars Versus Montgomery Ward—
The divergent saIcs and earnings of the nation's two largest mail order houses in recent years has'not been due entirely to the widely publicized and differing policies on expansion. Robert E. Wood, chairman ot Sears, Roebuck Co., Adopted a bold program of expansion at the end of the war. Seweil Avery, chairman of Montgomery Ward & Co., Inc., took the opposite course and has held expenditures on new factories to a minimum in the belief that the country would run into a serious depression, as after previous wa rs. But there’s another reason why Ward has not shown up 'Scars since the wat, a reason generally overlooked. .
For many years. Sears has
policy of Improving its sources of supply, mostly by obtaining a substantial slock interest in manufacturing firms, but partly by purchasing factories. During the past few years. Sears has ventured even further in this direction than prior to the war. This policy has helped Sears in two ways: In cases where demand for an item exceeds supply. Scars undoubtedly is Able to obtain more merchandise than Ward. Sears also makes a double profit, because it gets both the manufacturing and retailing mark-ups.
Up to the minute ’figures aren't available to show precisely how important Scars' manufacturing plants are, but in 1947 investment in wholly owned factories alone was $29,300,000. Those factories produced $62,900.000 worth of goods, of which Sears look $44 million. Output of partially owned factories swelled this $44 million to $334 million. or nbout 16% of total sales that year, compared with 7% in 1935. Wholly and partially owned Sears factories mnke refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, paint, farm equipment/stoves, wallpaper, tiros, and many other products. By contrast, Ward has only three factories, and they account for about 2% of.the firm’s total merchandise requirements. Ward factories make paint, fencing, cream separators, and ham-mermllls,	.
