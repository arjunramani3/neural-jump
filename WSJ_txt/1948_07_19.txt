Fort l*itt Brcuing Co.—
Although beer production by the Fort Pitt Brewing Co., listed on the New York Curb, is considerably greater than last year, the company is able to satisfy only about half the demand for its Fort Pitt and Old Shay beer. According to Michael Bcrardino. president. the company’s sales for the fiscal year to end October 31 will be at least 25% above last year's record sales of more than $22 million. From November 1 to June 30. Fort Pitt’s two breweries at Sharpsburg and Jeannette. Pa., produced 731,000 barrels of beer. This compared with approximately 555.000 barrels m the like period last year. Output is expected to continue high during the remaining four months of this fiscal year, so that the number of barrels for the entire year should go well over the million mark. In the year ended October 31. 194 7, barrets produced amounted to 970.000.
In the company’s expansion program, three new bottling lines have been added ; at the Sharpsburg brewery, and the fourth should be in operation in three or four weeks.
