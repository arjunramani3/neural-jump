Temporary Afoncy Conditions Alone Responsible for Reaction/ View of Harvard Economic Society
Special from Boston ATewa Bureau
BOSTON—In its current weekly letter the Harvard Economic Society comments as follows on last week's break in the stock market: “Not until Thursday did call rates rise to a - level which unsettled speculative opinion and precipitated a sharp reaction in the stock market. The high level of stock prices and the extent to which borrowed money has been employed in speculation, rendered the market especially sensitive to such temporary influences. 'This reaction, a natural sequel to the rapid and almost uninterrupted uprush of stock prices since the election, we interpret as one of those intermediate movements.
“In other words, it was due to a temporary money condition and not to a major change in the general economic situation.”	*
