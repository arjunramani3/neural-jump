SIGNS THAT A U.S.-led war in Iraq is only days away sent stock prices soaring both in the U.S. and abroad, with investors scrambling to catch a widely predicted rally that assumes a quick end to the conflict.
The U.S. rally was broad. Only one of 30 stocks in the Dow industrials finished down: Altria Group Inc., the newly named parent of Philip Morris. The rally yesterday followed strong gains earlier in Europe.
Outside the U.S., stocks rose in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.37%, or 0.36 point, to 96.79.

SIGNS THAT A U.S.-led war in Iraq is only days away sent stock prices soaring both in the U.S. and abroad, with investors scrambling to catch a widely predicted rally that assumes a quick end to the conflict.
Traders, though, noted that yesterday's 282.21-point runup in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- on the second-heaviest trading volume of the year on the New York Stock Exchange, behind only the rally on Thursday of last week -- highlighted risks to the market. Any deviation to the quick-victory scenario could cost investors dearly at a time when the economy itself still is wobbly.
The market also is looking ahead to today's announcement at 2:15 p.m. Eastern Time by the Federal Reserve's interest-rate committee. While some economists are hoping for a quarter-point cut in interest rates, most strategists believe the Fed is unlikely to provide further relief in the form of a cut.
But it was the apparent end of diplomatic haggling in the Iraq crisis, and the seeming inevitability of conflict, that drove trading yesterday. The Dow industrial average's 3.6% gain, to put it back above 8000 at 8141.92, was its biggest one-day gain since Oct. 15 of last year. It also marked the first four-day gain for the blue-chip average in more than two months.
Strategists said they expected stocks to continue to rally in the next few days if an attack on Iraq begins, and if those operations show early success. But even then, the market will still face question marks ranging from underlying weakness in the world economy and corporate earnings to the threat of terrorism.
"Now that we're getting some clarity regarding Iraq, it just removes one of the obstacles for anyone who wanted to claim that as an uncertainty facing the market," said strategist Christopher Wolfe of J.P. Morgan. "For months now, anyone who's nervous about the war has already been selling, so in a way, there was no where left to go but up."
Early trading in Tokyo today reflected the U.S. markets' strength. The Nikkei Stock Average, which had sagged 134.05 points, or 1.6%, on Monday, was up more than 167 points at the close of the morning session, back over the Nikkei's 8000 threshold.
The U.S. rally was broad. Only one of 30 stocks in the Dow industrials finished down: Altria Group Inc., the newly named parent of Philip Morris. The rally yesterday followed strong gains earlier in Europe.
The Nasdaq Composite Index yesterday jumped nearly 3.9%, or 51.94 points, to 1392.27 -- and now is up 4% for the year, even though the Dow industrials remain in the red, down 2%. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index leapt to 862.79, up 3.5%, or 29.52 points, and down 2% on the year.
Both the S&P 500 and the industrial average are up nearly 10% from the trading lows hit last Wednesday, before the pronounced "war rally" that began with Thursday's 269.68-point jump in the Dow industrials.
Volume on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday hit its high for the year, at 1.86 billion shares, and the NYSE's 1.69 billion shares trailed only the 1.72 billion on Thursday. Trading curbs that slow down program trading when the industrial average moves up or down 170 points from the previous day's close (and then are removed if the Dow average moves back to within 80 points of that close) kicked in several times during the session's frenzied buying -- as buyers sought to join the rally and short sellers, who bet on stocks' declines, sought to unwind their positions.
Investments in havens fell, as they historically do when stocks surge. In recent days, however, such correlations haven't always held true. That they did yesterday was further proof of the staying power of the stock rally, which could last at least through the start of fighting in Iraq, strategists said.
Treasury bonds were sharply lower, as was crude oil, which fell for the fifth time in six days, to $34.93 a barrel, in New York trading. Crude futures are down more than 7.5% during that period.
Gold was up more than $8 in the morning, but most of that rally fizzled by day's end, leaving the metal up just 60 cents, at $337.20 a troy ounce, on the Comex division of
the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Stocks Surge on Clarity Over War With Iraq --- Blue Chips Rally 3.6% But Bonds Pull Back; Fed Panel Meets Today - ProQuest
Before the start of yesterday's trading, the market already was digesting statements by top administration officials on the Sunday political talk shows expressing doubt that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein will voluntarily disarm.
Then, early in the trading session, the U.S., Britain and Spain announced they had ended their efforts to win United Nations support for a war and that President Bush would give Saddam Hussein an ultimatum during a televised address to the nation.
"The three things that the market wanted clarity on are that the U.S will pursue the Iraqi situation unilaterally, that it will begin soon and that a military option is the one we will take," said strategist Jim Russell, of Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati. "We got clarity on all those points today."
One nonwar factor that continues to weigh down shares is a weak corporate earnings outlook. According to Thomson Financial/First Call, the ratio of negative corporate earnings preannouncements to positive ones for the first-quarter so far is 2.7, higher than at any point last year.
For that reason, many market watchers are only guardedly optimistic about the length of any war-related rally. Strategist Tobias Levkovich, of Salomon Smith Barney, said such "trading rallies" historically can push major indexes up 20% to 25%, but "no one believes that's going to happen" now.
Strategist Ned Riley, of State Street Global Advisors, said he believes the rally will continue steadily over the next few days or weeks, perhaps interrupted by occasional profit-taking as investors who still are nervous jump at their first chance to pocket gains.
Beyond that, Mr. Riley said many investors are now using the last Gulf War as their guide for how to react to geopolitical risk in the market. But he said investors will shed such comparisons once the specific characteristics of the new conflict become apparent.
"We may have more problems, and more casualties, and a much more unusual type of warfare than we had 13 years ago," Mr. Riley said.
Outside the U.S., stocks rose in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.37%, or 0.36 point, to 96.79.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, 2,414 stocks rose and 893 fell.
Bonds fell. The 10-year Treasury note fell 1 1/32, or $10.31 for each $1,000 invested, to push the yield, which moves opposite to price, to 3.835%. The 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 8/32, putting its yield at 4.796%.
The dollar rallied. Against the euro, the dollar strengthened to $1.0637 per euro, compared with $1.0743 on Friday. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar rose to fetch 118.46 yen compared with 118.33.
