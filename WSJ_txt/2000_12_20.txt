The sell-off yesterday, amid continuing disappointment over the Federal Reserve's decision not to cut interest rates on Tuesday, affected an array of companies, including some outside the tech sector. While the broader market in recent months escaped the brunt of the pain inflicted on Nasdaq investors, all kinds of stocks now are suffering, albeit not as much as technology stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell a comparable amount to the Dow industrials, or 3.13%, to 1264.74.
As of yesterday's close, the industrial average was down 10% in 2000, on track for its worst year since 1977; the S&P 500 was down nearly 14%, on track for its worst year since 1974; and the Nasdaq composite's 43% drop put it on pace for, by far, the worst year since its creation.
On the one hand, there is no consistent pattern that bad years are followed by good years, notes James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC. True, negative years for blue chips in 1981 and 1990 were followed by double-digit gains. But the awful 17% decline in both the Dow and S&P 500 in 1973 was followed by an even worse, near-30% plunge, in 1974. And double-digit declines in 1977 were followed by a nearly flat 1978. Furthermore, it is harder today for investors to make up in dividends what they lose in price; dividend yields now are far lower.

Stocks took another wrenching fall yesterday, virtually ensuring that the most spectacular bull market in stocks this century has given way to what will likely end up as one of the worst years in a generation.
Yesterday, the nine-month sell-off in technology stocks accelerated, sending the Nasdaq Composite Index on its latest historic slide, amid trading volume that neared record levels. The index, packed with tech stocks, slid more than 7%, the seventh-worst one-day percentage loss since Nasdaq's founding in 1971.
The tech-stock plummet continued a pullback for the Nasdaq index -- interspersed with fleeting rallies -- that began after the index hit a record 5048.62 in March. The index, after yesterday's 178.93-point loss, now stands at 2332.78, its lowest level since March 1999.
The Nasdaq index is now 54% below the high point in March and 43% lower for the year, a capitulation that has some veteran investors turning to some of the stock market's worst periods for comparisons, including the Oct. 19, 1987, stock-market crash.
"It's not like October 1987, which happened all at once, but this isn't just a bear market, it's a crash for the Nasdaq, there's no other term," said money manager Scott Black, president of Delphi Management Inc. in Boston. "There's panic selling and I think there will be more bloodletting."
The overall stock market hasn't been pounded nearly as much as Nasdaq; still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.51%, or 265.44 points, to 10318.93, a move that might have been noteworthy were it not for Nasdaq's much-larger tumble.
Technology's drop yesterday, like its plunge since September, got lots of fuel from bad profit news. Late Tuesday, Internet switch maker Foundry Networks said fourthquarter earnings would be well below analysts' estimates. Yesterday, investors more than cut its stock in half while dumping other networking companies like Cisco Systems, which was downgraded by Merrill Lynch and fell 13%; Nortel Networks, down 7%; and JDS Uniphase, down 11%.
The latest milestone of how New Economy stocks have turned from can't-miss to catastrophe: The Dow Jones Internet Index, which tracks 40 Web-related stocks including Amazon.com and CMGI, slid yesterday to a staggering 75% below the record hit in March.
Now, barring an explosive rally in the last six trading days of the year, 2000 will go into the books as the overall stock market's worst year since the 1980s or even the 1970s.
What will it take to turn this market around? Soothing words from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggesting the Fed will aggressively cut interest rates would help. So would a halt to the blitz of earnings warnings from leading companies, which continued after the market closed yesterday with one from AT&T. Some say investor sentiment has to get even worse before things get better.
"People are still expecting their stocks to come back, that it's still a buying opportunity," says Robert Farrell, senior investment adviser at Merrill Lynch. "Only now are the analysts turning bearish and companies reporting negative fundamentals. Eventually, the analysts will tell you why you shouldn't buy tech stocks. You have to take the cycle to the opposite extreme." Indeed, 29% of average individual investors still think now is a good time to buy, compared with 4% who think it is a good time to sell, according to a Gallup/PaineWebber survey to be released today. The remaining 63% think it is better to wait and see. On average they still expect annual returns of 15% in the next 10 years.
The sell-off yesterday, amid continuing disappointment over the Federal Reserve's decision not to cut interest rates on Tuesday, affected an array of companies, including some outside the tech sector. While the broader market in recent months escaped the brunt of the pain inflicted on Nasdaq investors, all kinds of stocks now are suffering, albeit not as much as technology stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell a comparable amount to the Dow industrials, or 3.13%, to 1264.74.
Investors, who had been hoping for a year-end rally, now confront the possibility that the troubles could get worse before they get better for stocks. Indeed, while some sense bargains in beaten-down stocks, few predict there will be enough bargain hunting to turn the market around soon.

Nasdaq Index Falls 7%, Leaving It 54% Below High Point in March - ProQuest
Treasury bond prices soared amid the pain in stocks, as investors flocked to the safety of Treasurys. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 1 5/32, or $11.5625 for each $1,000 invested, pushing down its yield to 5.047%, its lowest level since early 1999. The drop in yields will likely push down mortgage rates, small consolation for consumers suffering steep losses in their stock portfolios.
Traders said much of the selling came from nervous investors eager to dump stocks no matter what the outlook of the companies.
"It's a steady stream of selling; emotion has become more important than fundamentals," said Keith Brickman, head of Nasdaq trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "There's momentum selling, mutual funds are getting high-multiple stocks off their books, and I've been a bit surprised at the magnitude of the capitulation."
As of yesterday's close, the industrial average was down 10% in 2000, on track for its worst year since 1977; the S&P 500 was down nearly 14%, on track for its worst year since 1974; and the Nasdaq composite's 43% drop put it on pace for, by far, the worst year since its creation.
Yet while 2000 may end up as worse than 1990, 1981 or 1977 in stock performance, to many investors it may not feel quite so bad. For one thing, these declines follow five-straight years of returns averaging 25% for the blue chips and 42% for Nasdaq.
This year's decline, while steep, "barely makes a dent in the mountain of wealth that has appreciated over the latter half of the 1990s," says Steve Roach, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Adds Jeremy Siegel, finance professor at the Wharton School, "If we go back through history, about one out of every three is a down year. We've been so incredibly spoiled by the bull market of the '90s, indeed since 1982, that a lot of people forget about the risks inherent in stocks, particularly in the short run. This is not an unusual fall from a historic standpoint."
Furthermore, the market's decline, just like its advance in 1999, has been remarkably restricted to the technology sector. Excluding technology, the S&P 500 was down only 4% through mid-December, after rising 3% in 1999, according to John Mullin, ABN Amro's equity strategist for the Americas. And the Dow industrials -- excluding Intel and Microsoft, which were added in November 1999 -- are up 12%, according to WSJ Market Data Group.
"It's almost the pure mirror image," says Mr. Mullin. "Since mid-1999, when this thing got going, we've done the round trip with March being the peak."
If the year 2000 ends up as miserably as it now looks, does that bode well or badly for next year? History offers conflicting lessons.
On the one hand, there is no consistent pattern that bad years are followed by good years, notes James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC. True, negative years for blue chips in 1981 and 1990 were followed by double-digit gains. But the awful 17% decline in both the Dow and S&P 500 in 1973 was followed by an even worse, near-30% plunge, in 1974. And double-digit declines in 1977 were followed by a nearly flat 1978. Furthermore, it is harder today for investors to make up in dividends what they lose in price; dividend yields now are far lower.
But on the other hand, inflation was far higher from the 1970s through 1990 than it is today, notes Prof. Siegel. That means modestly positive years back then represented declines in the real value of investors' assets. Indeed, the quiescence of inflation is one reason investors' other major asset, bonds, have been on a tear this year. The Lehman Brothers government-bond index is up 11%, whereas in previous stock bear markets, bonds had modest to miserable years. "This has been a good year for bonds, except junk bonds, and a very decent year for real estate. Outside the tech sector, people's other assets are not doing that much."
But because the stock market is so much larger, the loss in sheer wealth far exceeds anything seen before. Based on the year to date change in the Wilshire 5000 index, investors have lost about $1.8 trillion in stock wealth since the beginning of the year, more than what the entire market was worth at the beginning of 1981 and about half what it was worth in 1990.
In major U.S. market action:
Major stock indexes fell. On the Big Board, where 1.42 billion shares traded, 1,933 stocks declined while 1,010 stocks advanced. Nasdaq volume was about 2.78 billion shares.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, the currency traded at 90.88 cents to the euro and 112.68 yen to the dollar, weakening from 89.51 cents but strengthening from 112.40 yen.
