Nasdaq said it will acquire a majority stake in a struggling pan-European exchange, Easdaq, to create an exchange that will trade shares in blue-chip U.S. and European companies.

Nasdaq Europe also plans to use the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. of the U.S., Nasdaq's partner in both the U.S. and Asia, to create a pan-European clearing and settlement platform, rather than using a European firm.
An advantage for Nasdaq could be Knight Trading Group Inc., Jersey City, N.J., Nasdaq's biggest market maker; Knight has been Easdaq's largest shareholder, and announced a "round table" of smaller brokers to send it buy-and-sell orders for both U.S. and European shares that would then be executed on Easdaq.

LONDON -- The Nasdaq Stock Market finally bagged a European prey.
Nasdaq said it will acquire a majority stake in a struggling pan-European exchange, Easdaq, to create an exchange that will trade shares in blue-chip U.S. and European companies. Although not as glamorous as some earlier aborted deals involving Nasdaq, the transaction with Brussels-based Easdaq at last gives Nasdaq a European foothold.
European markets, meanwhile, followed U.S. stocks higher as investors remained optimistic that the European Central Bank would cut rates as early as tomorrow. Asian markets were mostly lower. Tokyo shares fell 1.6% after gaining nearly 5% the day before. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 1.72%, or 3.17, to 187.46. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 0.87%, or 1.20, to 139.69.
Nasdaq said it will invest 70 million euros ($62.6 million), including technology upgrades, for a 58% share of Easdaq, which will be renamed Nasdaq Europe. That stake is expected to shrink to 51% after eight "major securities firms" from the U.S. and Europe take stakes, said Nasdaq Chairman Frank Zarb, who declined to name the firms involved. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., New York, said it is likely to be one of them.
Mr. Zarb said the deal, expected to be approved by Easdaq shareholders on Friday, doesn't represent the end of Nasdaq's European ambitions. "We are in continuous dialogue," he said, with Europe's three major exchanges -- the London Stock Exchange, Deutsche Boerse and Euronext, itself a merger of the French, Dutch and Belgian markets -- "because sooner or later there is going to be consolidation at that level, and we want to be a part of it."
About 14 million euros of Nasdaq's investment will be in cash, and the eight securities firms will contribute about the same amount, said a person familiar with the matter. Easdaq, which had been running out of money, brings a state-of-the-art trading system that should be installed by summer.
The announcement, which had been expected, is Nasdaq's third attempt in the past 18 months to become a player in the increasingly competitive world of European markets. Major securities firms rejected a first plan to create a new exchange, also to be called Nasdaq Europe. A second plan involved teaming up with a merged London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse, but that proposed merger fell apart after four months. Nasdaq once held a 4% stake in the five-year-old Easdaq, but never took an active role until now.
Nasdaq and Easdaq officials said the new plan will include the trading of both U.S. and European blue-chip stocks, including about 50 companies listed on the rival New York Stock Exchange; under European rules, exchanges can list shares for trading without the company's permission. Nasdaq Europe also plans to use the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. of the U.S., Nasdaq's partner in both the U.S. and Asia, to create a pan-European clearing and settlement platform, rather than using a European firm.
Nasdaq Europe is just the latest in a string of alternative trading systems that have been announced in Europe, none of which have succeeded.
Only 60 companies chose Easdaq for their IPOs; instead, they generally chose national markets for fast-growing companies, especially Germany's Neuer Markt. Jiway, a pan-European trading system aimed at individual investors and jointly owned by OM Gruppen AB of Sweden and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., has failed to win much business.
Tradepoint Financial Networks, an upstart that unsuccessfully challenged the London Stock Exchange, is getting a second chance as part of a pan-European exchange called virt-x, controlled by Swiss Exchanges, and will launch in June. Traditional exchanges have also tried, and generally failed, to swipe trading volumes in blue-chip stocks from rival markets.
An advantage for Nasdaq could be Knight Trading Group Inc., Jersey City, N.J., Nasdaq's biggest market maker; Knight has been Easdaq's largest shareholder, and announced a "round table" of smaller brokers to send it buy-and-sell orders for both U.S. and European shares that would then be executed on Easdaq.

Another sticking point could be the interest of individual European investors to buy and sell shares outside their home market. While Knight and Nasdaq say the demand exists, Jiway's experience suggests that isn't the case. Nasdaq officials say they expect individual investors to use Nasdaq Europe first, with institutional investors joining in later.
Nasdaq also must persuade investors that it can truly reduce the cost of cross-border clearing and settlement, which is becoming increasingly important to securities firms. This unglamorous business, which ensures that cash and securities change hands on time, is about 10 times more costly for a cross-border European trade than for a similar transaction in the U.S. John Hilley, president of Nasdaq International, said the cost of dealing on Nasdaq Europe will be "significantly below" the headline fee levied by Jiway for cross-border deals.
The announcement is the second European deal in two days for Nasdaq. On Monday, it pre-empted U.S. derivatives markets by announcing a partnership with the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, to bring single-stock futures to U.S. investors by year's end.
