Investors this time are worried about a possible double-dip recession in the U.S. and the euro zone's debt crisis spreading to bigger members of the 17-nation bloc. The futures reached an all-time high of $1,817.60 an ounce in intraday trading Thursday before reversing ground to settle at $1,751.50 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after the CME Group said it would raise margin requirements on gold contracts.

NEW YORK--The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its first back-to-back gain in more than a month.
As one of the most volatile weeks in Wall Street history ended, the blue-chip index closed up 125.71 points, or 1.1%, to 11269.02. Stocks remained solidly in positive territory throughout Friday as an upbeat retail sales report trumped a weak reading on consumer confidence.
Boeing helped lead the way, rising 4.4%. Hewlett-Packard gained 3.6% and Caterpillar rose 3.5%.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 6.17, or 0.5%, to 1178.81, led by industrial and consumer discretionary stocks. The index hasn't had two consecutive sessions of gains since July 22.
The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite rose 15.30 points, or 0.6%, to 2507.98.
The market's recent moves this week are the wildest since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008. Investors this time are worried about a possible double-dip recession in the U.S. and the euro zone's debt crisis spreading to bigger members of the 17-nation bloc.
The Dow surged 423 points on Thursday, marking the first time in the index's 115-year history that it has moved by more than 400 points in one direction or another for four consecutive trading days. For the week, the Dow was down 1.5%.
"Traders and investors are at a point of absolute exhaustion. The back and forth action is draining," said Gary Flam, portfolio manager at Los Angeles-based Bel Air Investment Advisors. "Investors are just waiting now to see what the market has in store for next week."
The Dow's gains on Friday overshadowed that of the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks. The results highlight how investors are flocking to some of the larger, more stable companies as they move back into stocks and steering clear of some of the smaller and more riskier companies.
"When people get worried, they fly over to well-known names," said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Securities. "It falls into this economic theme where people are questioning growth prospects for the second half of this year and 2012."
The Russell 2000 in late trading gained 4.63 points, or 0.7%, to 700.52.
Investors turned their attention Friday to a positive reading on consumer spending. Retail sales, an important indicator of consumer spending and typically a major driver of economic growth, rose 0.5% in July. Consumers spent more on gasoline, electronics and other merchandise, potentially easing concerns that Americans are pulling back.
The data overshadowed an indicator of consumer sentiment that showed a sharp fall in August. The consumer sentiment index from Reuters/University of Michigan tumbled to 54.9 in mid-August, the lowest level since 1980 and down sharply from 63.7 in late July. Economists had expected the reading to ease only to 62.
"The market's doing reasonably well considering how bad that number was," said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management. "But we still think there's more to go on the downside as the effects of confidence start showing up in the economic data."
European markets were broadly higher Friday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 staging its first two-day win streak in three weeks. European officials announced short-selling bans on some financial stocks in an effort to curb traders' abilities to profit when they decline.
Gold futures fell to $1,739 an ounce. The futures reached an all-time high of $1,817.60 an ounce in intraday trading Thursday before reversing ground to settle at $1,751.50 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after the CME Group said it would raise margin requirements on gold contracts.
Crude-oil futures rose but held below $87 a barrel. The U.S. dollar lost ground against both the euro and the yen.
In corporate news, J.C. Penney's fiscal second-quarter earnings were flat as the department-store operator posted lower sales on the exit of its catalog business. Shares inched down 0.5%.
Nvidia reversed earlier gains and recently fell 3.1% after the graphics-chip maker reported second-quarter results and a third-quarter sales outlook that surpassed expectations.
Bally Technologies slumped 14% following a disappointing outlook for the current fiscal year, while MannKind shot up 21% after the company confirmed with the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration the design of two clinical studies.

Nordstrom rose 6.6% as second-quarter earnings rose 20% from a year ago. The upscale retailer also boosted its full-year earnings guidance.
DeVry's fourth-quarter earnings rose, but the operator of for-profit schools said new student enrollment dropped sharply. The rollout of new regulations likely distracted employees in the latest quarter and hurt performance, according to the company. The stock plummeted 17%.
Shares of fellow for-profit educators also fell. ITT Educational Services slid 3.3%, Strayer Education dropped 2.5% and Corinthian Colleges fell 4.3%.
