Big Board Takes Off at Midsession On Dollar’s Surge, Posts Sharp Rise
ABREAST OF THE MARKET
Bv David Wilson	'
The stock market took off at midsession on a sudden surge in the dollar and posted its sharpest advance in more than three months, even though a New York Stock Exchange rule that restricts program trading went into effect for the first time.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had gained nearly 17 points Tuesday, leapt 64.16 to 2061.67. It was the sharpest rise since Jan. 4, the first session of 1988, when the average Jumped 76.42 points.
Trading activity picked up along with prices. Big Board volume totaled 189.8 million shares, well above Tuesday's total of
135.3	million.
Traders said the fuel for the rally came from a report that the Group of Seven major industrial countries would decide to keep the dollar stabilized at 125 yen at its meeting in Washington next week.
The report, over Nikkei Telecom, a Japanese news service, triggered an immediate upturn in the dollar against other major currencies.
As a result, the stock market snapped back to life at midsession after drifting at slightly higher levels on light volume throughout the morning. The advance was bolstered by gains in the bond market, which took the report as a sign that the Federal Reserve may not have to tighten credit to boost the dollar, as had been feared.
The industrial average first showed a gain of more than 50 points with half an hour left in the session. This caused the Big Board to cut off use of its automated order delivery system for stock-index arbitrage and other forms of program trading. The 50-point cap was adopted in early February in response to concern about the impact of buy and sell programs on market volatility.
The restriction wasn't enough to prevent the market from adding to its gains, however, and the Dow industrial average closed at its high for tile session.
Among broader market averages, Standard & Poor’s 500-Stock Average soared 6.98 to 265.49, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index surged 3.47 to 149.76. Almost 1,200 issues rose in price on the Big Board, and only about 400 fell.
John D. Connolly, research director and chairman of the investment committee at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the market's sharp advance wasn’t too surprising, given the evidence that the economy has held to a pattern of moderate growth.
“We have had, in the last six months, some awfully good economic news, and the market has been very, very hesitant," he said. "Just based on the fundamentals, I think we were due for something like this."

Given the amount of time that has passed since last October’s market crash, Mr. Connolly said investors are likely to stop waiting for "the other shoe to drop"-in other words, another market collapse or a recesslon-and start to take some Interest in stocks. “At some stage, people will start thinking that maybe there’s not another shoe, that maybe both shoes dropped at the same tlme-Oct. 19,” he said.
Mary Farrell, a market analyst at PaineWebber, said she was less impressed with the surge in stock prices. The advance mainly reflected the market’s neutral position in recent sessions and its anticipation of a major outside event, such as the Japanese news report, that would provide it witli some type of direction.
"The market really has been in a trading range, and that's where it’s likely to stay,” she said. "At the level of current short-term rates, there really isn’t a lot of downside risk, but at the current level of long-term rates, there's not a lot of upside potential."
Prominent gainers among blue-chip issues included General Motors, up 394 to 74; Philip Morris, up 2% to 9294; Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, up 394 to 60%; Procter & Gamble, up 294 to 8094; and International Paper, up 216 to 45.
