Industrial Average Off 2.3%. Rails Drop 3.8% On Korea War News, Higher Taxes Outlook
Armed with a fresh budget of unfavorable war news and deepening concern in the financial district over the business outlook under the burden of an excess profit tax* bears assaulted stocks anew yesterday. A large volume of professional selling, concentrated in the first and final hours, hammered down the industrial average 5.22 points or 2.3%. The railroads lost 2.65. or 3.8%. and the utilities 0.65 or 1.7%. Of the day's total transactions of 2.510.000 shares. 870.000 came In the first hour, when the tape was a minute behind floor transactions for some 22 minutes.
Many of the day’s 31 new 1950 lows were set during this period but a secondary sinking spell late in the session added to the total as investors showed no disposition to raise bids in the face of an ineffectual mid-session rally. Pivotals off two to three points Included American Smelting. Bethlehem Steel. Chrysler. Du Font, Goodyear. Texas Co., Gulf Oil. Republic Steel. Atchison. Atlantic Coast Line. Delaware & Hudson and Southern Pacific Some higher-priced, more volatile stocks suffered worse declines
Nickel Plate, for instance, dropped 9 and International Business Machines 6’^. One of the 60 stocks which managed to reach higher ground during the day out of 1,208 which appeared on the tape, was White Sewing Machine, which responded to announcement of a year-end dividend after being off a point In early trading Aircrafts recovered fractions of initial losses but demand was not sustained in any section of the list. St. Louis Southwestern Railway was alone among common stocks ending up a point or more, adding 2 to 220 after selling as low as 215

Chas. Pfizer & Co.—
Earnings of Chas. Pfizer A Co have shown 1 a marked upward trend in each quarter so far this year, reversing the trend during 1949 Profits in the March quarter were $1.21 a share against $1.69 a year ago. In the June quarter they were $1.42 against 51.35 and in the September quarter net was $1.86 a share against $1.05 in the like 1949 period. For the full-year 1949 the firm reported $5 18 a share. In the first nine months of this year net was 54.49 a share and in the September quarter earnings were at the annual rate of over $7 a share. Since the current quarter is expected to be at least as profitable as the September period, it is estimated the firm may show around $6.50 for the full year and perhaps more. Pfizer’s profits in 1949 were affected adversely by the decline in penicillin prices
Its new drug terramycin has been under development for the past year and is probably only now beginning to show up in income. Meanwhile, the penicillin situation has improved greatly so the firm can look forward to a very good year in 1951. It recently announced two new antibiotic drugs which have not yet been fully clinically tested.

Airline Earnings and Taxes—
The early form of the new tax bill indicates the airlines are not coming out very well under the excess profits tax legislation despite the special alternative by which they may use 5% of capital plus debt as their exemption. Approximate calculations for the seven carriers analyzed below show rone where the average earnings method is ad-vantageous.^and two where the 5% option is less advantageous than the type of invested capita) base offered generally to al! companies.
The amounts shown in the tabulation aie what could be rained per common shaic after preferred dividends and after application of the "noima!” 43*> tax without incurring the 75zr excess profits tax. These calculations are
taken from the December 31. 1949. balance sheets, and in the case of Pan American Airlines and certain others, subsequent increases in debt will presumably raise the excess profit tax exemptions. This year’s earnings, if not paid out. can also be added to invested capita). It also must be kent in mind that the bonk* companies keep for tax purposes are often not quite the same as in reports to stockholder* du- tn dlffrirnt treatment of reserves and other itc’.i* Finally these figures are not the limits of what the comnan’cs can earn. Any earnings higher than these would pay the 75* 'r rate.
