The securities and the commodities markets Saturday made a spectacular response to the overnight news of passage by the Senate of the Farm Relief bill and the rider embodying the Administration’s inflation program. In trading wnicn ran to almost 1,000,000 shares in the first half hour, and totaled 3,390,000 shares for the two-hour session, industrial stocks swept forward in spirited style. Gains in the leaders ran to from 1 to points. Railroad and utility shares lagged behind the Industrials for a time, but spurted forward in the late dealings.
In the bond list, speculative obligations were the favorites, and advanced on a broad front.
Commodities made more sensational advances than stocks. Wheat was 51/. to 6 cents a bushel in Chicago, and cotton advanced $2 a bale. Other commodities shared in the upturn, but gains were not as sharp as those in grains. Renewed weakness in the dollar was a prime factor in bringing about soaring prices for stocks and staples.
The stock market leaders were such old favorites as United States Steel common. General Motors, Montgomery Ward, Allied Chemical and Corn Products. The tape could not keep up with the trading pace, and lagged far behind from the outset. The tape was studded with big blocks of stock, some of them involving 15,000 shares.
Steel Nem Aids Market
In addition to the new spirit infused into the market by the Senate’s action on the Farm Bill and the inflation program, the stock market derived some nourishment from the favoring trade news. Steel shares were benefltted particularly, with operations for the industry put at 29% of capacity, double the rate a month ago.
Rails Push Through Trading Area High
At Saturday’s close, the Dow-Jones average of 20 railroad stocks had penetrated the trading area high of 30.61, set on November 12. The action of the rail average confirms the previous break through of the industrial average; and clearly foreshadows a thorough^ testing of the highs of the upswing last fall. The high in the fall rally was set by the industrial average, at 79.93, on September 3, and the rail average reached its fall top of 39.27 on September 3. Should both averages penetrate those two levels by a margin of a full point, it would be regarded by students of the Dow theory as full evidence that a definite change in the stock market trend had occurred, and that a bull market was under way.
At Saturday's close, the industrial average was only a little more than 2 points under the high of last fall, and the rail average about 7 points under the September lop.
Close to Record Trading
In Saturday’s turbulent session, trading ran to 3.390,000 shares of stock, the largest for any two-hour session since May 3, 1930, when 4,867,500 shares changed hands, the record for a Saturday. The ticker reported the last sale at 12:201l, the record late close since the highspeed ticker service went into operation, September 2, 1930. On May 3, 1930, when the old tickers were in operation, the final sale was not recorded on the ticker until 1:56 in the afternoon. Saturday’s market was a broad market, too, but much of the activity was concentrated a few stocks, like General Motors, Montgomery Ward, Steel common and a few others of the old-time leaders.
Wheat Crop Forecast* Coming
Within the next day or two, private crop forecasters will present their estimates of the winter wheat crop, based on the condition as of May 1. These forecasts will play a big part in the fluctuations of grain prices over the near future, and will be topped off by the Government’s forecast of the crop, on the basis of May 1 condition, which will make its appearance on May 10.
The private crop forecasts, and the Government’s new estimate will compare with the forecast of 334,000,000 bushels by the Government on April 10. The Government's forecast in April took the grain market by surprise, for it put the potential production on the basis of April 1 condition, 21,000,000 bushels under the lowest estimate turned in by private crop estimates.
Weather in the winter wheat belt, In the first 15 days of April, was very bad for the growing crop. Lack of rain and extremely damaging dust storms made the crop outlook even more discouraging than it was at the opening of the month. Since mid-April, however, weather in the winter wheat belt has been more propitious, with beneficial ruins in much of the district. It is questionably, however, whether the rains in the latter part of the month offset the effects of the (bad weather in the first half. Because of the wide diversity of opinion on this point, the private crop forecasters’ reports will be important items on the week's schedule of developments.
in the latest period over the three previous periods was much more pronounced this year than in 1932. The decline from the volume for the corresponding period a year previous was only 12.6%, against 25.2% in the March weeks, and around 18% for the first two periods of the year.	’
One of the big factors in the improved outlook for both mail order bouses and department store companies is that there is a good prospect they will not hav» to take any inventory losses this year. Elver since th a depression got under way, with prices dropping downward steadily, inventory losses have constituted a heavy part of the annual losses shown by both the mail order and department store companies.
Loadings Report Favorable
The carloadings report for the week ended April 22 was more favorable than had been anticipated. While loadings were slightly under the previous week, the gap from the like 1932 week was reduced. Daily loadings reports for some carriers, particularly in the Northwest, have been very cheering in the past week. In one case, one day’s loadings actually exceeded those for the similar day of 1932.
While such showings may not be typical of the country as a whole, there is every indication now that railroad traffic, within the next three weeks, will be running ahead of the like period a year ago. When that transpires, railroad earnings should furnish far more cheerful reading than they have in a long time.
Utility Legislation Ahead
The Senate is scheduled to begin, on Tuesday, consideration of the House action in voting to place the 3% tax on domestic and commercial power on the operating companies, instead of on the consumers, as at present. Passage of that legislation by the House depressed the utility stocks, and they haVe been held back by the possibility that the Senate might concur in .the move of the Lower Branch. If the Senate rejects the proposed shift of the tax, utility stocks should turn in better performances. They are benefiting from the upturn In business, and there is every prospect that electric output soon will be above that of the similar period of 1932.

, Sharp Pick-Up In Scam Sales
Scars Roebuck qales In the four weeks ended April 23 recorded a sharp advance over the previous four-weck period and made a better comparison with the like 1932 weeks of any other period so far this year. The sharp advance in April was due to two factors. One was the general business improvement, with buyers fill: ing neecls which had been built up during the bank holiday period. Anothor was the fact that Easter was on April 1G this year, and fell on March 27 in 1932. The Easter demand was reflected in this year’s sales figures for the latest period covered, while much of it showed up In the March figures in 1932.
Sears’ sales for the four weeks to April 23 ran to $18,519,608, by far the largest volume for any four weeks so far this year. The advance
