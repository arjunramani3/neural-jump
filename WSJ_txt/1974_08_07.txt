Abreast of the Market
Industrials Surge 23.78 to 797.5(5 on Rumors That the Resignation of Nixon Was Imminent
Bv Vktok J Hillers
As reports circulated that President Nixon's resignation was imminent, the stock market yesterday continued to move sharply and broadly ahead in moderately active trading
Rocketing 23.78 points to 797 56, the Dow Jones industrial average scored its biggest gain in more than 3% weeks
Fueling the upsurge "obviously was speculation on President Nixon's resignation at a time the economic uncertainties have been greater than usual." commented Alfred E Goldman, vice president and director of A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. He added that "investors' confidence in Nixon's ability to handle our nation’s many economic problems is at an extremely low ebb ”
The market's action was "a classiccase of discounting in advance as traders were fairly confident Nixon will resign," said Larry Wachtel, Bache & Co. vice president
On Tuesday the industrial average had climbed 13.38 points in the wake of President Nixon's release of transcripts of three more White House meetings and his disclosure he had withheld evidence from the House Judiciary Committee. Big gains also were racked up yesterday by the transportation and utility averages
Advances Swamped Declines
The wide sweep of the advance was apparent from the 1,180 New York Stock Exchange gainers, more than four times the 261 losers
Big Board turnover slowed to 13,380,000 shares from 15,770,000 Tuesday: trading was at Its briskest pace during the final half hour. Institutional activity was mirrored in the slackening in trades of 10,000 shares or more to 69 from the prior day’s revised total of 105.
Resignation, said Mr. Goldman of A. G. Edwards, would remove one of the big uncertainties that have been overhanging the market. But as long as “nervous investors can still achieve historically high returns from almost riskless short-term instruments," he said, ’’a rally is likely to be temporary rather than the start of a new bull market.”
However, Mr Wachtel of Bache asserted that with Gerald Ford as President there could be "a honeymoon period” based on his cordial relations with Congressmen and the prospect of “a new wave of confidence.”
Advances again led backsliders by almost two-to-one on the American Stock Exchange and its index climbed 1.27 to 78.96. Trading eased to 1,520,000 shares from 1,710,000 the day before, A sizable gain also was posted by the National Association of Securities Dealers’ NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter stocks; it finished at 71.68, up 1.15.
Continuing to rise, prices of prime corporate bonds were up an average of about % point in the over-the-counter market. But long-term governments slipped 4-32 to 6-32 point.
Computer stocks again were strong on the Big Board and other rally participants included defense, chemical, copper, retail, drug, electronic, machinery, auto, oil, paper, television and steel issues. In contrast to the rest of the markets, golds were off sharply.
Glamours again were rally leaders and nart of their strength again stemmed from short covering, or buying of stock to replace borrowed shares sold earlier. International Business Machines jumped 6 to 214% and Johnson & Johnson 5l/2 to 96%. Polaroid, seventh most active, climbed 2% to 29% and MGIC, in 10th place, % to 12%. Also active, McDonald’s gained 1% to 43% and International Telephone, % to 20%.
Also among glamours. Avon, which announced price increases, gained 1% to
