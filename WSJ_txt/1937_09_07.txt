The five year old bull movement received its worst blow yesterday as the industrial average plunged more than eight points and finished well under the lowest closing price reached during the June decline. Rails were depressed more than three points and the utility average lost	points, also finishing under the June
lows.
Offerings were heavy from the start, producing^ sharply lower prices at the opening. European developments were viewed with, misgiving, the latest incident between Russia and Italy being regarded as the gravest to come out of the conflict thus far. However, the market itself had provided much cause for anxiety, particularly its spiritless behavior during rallying periods. In fact, rallying efforts lately have been almost non-existent resulting in increasing offerings “at the market.” Yesterday’s volume at 1,870,000 shares, for instance, compared with
a turnover of only 690,000 shares during Friday, when a minor rally was staged.
Liquidation poured into the list in a steady stream, increasing in intensity in the final hour when the tape fell three minutes behind floor transactions. Prices were forced steadily lower, with U. S. Steel common, Westinghouse Electric, Sears Roebuck, du Font, Bethlehem and Chrysler losing 6 to 9 points.
Many of the moderate priced issues were down 3 to 4 points, showing heavy losses.	.
While stocks were falling, the commodity markets turned sharply upward. This was attributed to the war scare, but it also had some basis in the stronger technical position of those markets. Latter have been falling for some time, having started to lose ground well before stocks weakened. Bond prices were lower all along the line.

THENTOESS—
That the market was thin goes without saying. when a decline of eight points in industrials can take place on volume of 1.870,000 shares. This probably constitutes something ol a record. For about a half hour Johns-Manville was quoted 90 bid. offered 115, a spread of a cool 25 poinUi. The stock finally sold down to 110, a loss of 7% points. There was also some difficulty in bringing buyer and seller together tn International Harvester at one time. Throughout the rest of the list such difficulties were avoided by the simple expedient of accepting the best bid offered. Those special cases where tbe spread was advertised on the tape represented instances where the market appeared too absurd to permit a sale at the best bid and sales were held up awaiting better demand.

STEEL OUTPUT—
Little significance can be attached to this week’s abrupt holiday decline in steel activity
to 71.6% of capacity, against 84.1% the week before. The reduction may be a little more than Wall Street anticipated, but figures for the next couple of weeks will tell the real story For six weeks to two months the steel operating figures have lost some significance by virtue of the fact that high output represented the filling of old orders and was not a good measure of incoming business. True, the figtires reflected a higher rate of industrial production and employment, but they could not be depended upon as measuring up-to-date demands.	,	•
It is not likely that steel manufacturers will turn out production for stock during the next several weeks, no matter how much they desire steady production due to its beneficial effects on profit margins. A rate of production somewhat more in line with current demand may be expected in the next few weeks and this will restore usefulness of the figures as a measure of industrial well being.

CONSTRUCTION—
Opinions in the real estate field are quite mixed concerning the failure of construction to Improve more than it has. While high labor and material costs are mentioned, many believe there are other causes for lagging tendencies I In fact, one view is that the trouble is more ' deep-rooted Great stress Is placed on taxes. The burden is severe enough as it is. but it Ls pointed out that with local governments, and the national government, living beyond their means real estate faces the prospects of steadily increasing tax levies. This tendency is forcing people of wealth to frown upon too large a commitment in real estate, preferring more flexible and mobile places for employment of investment funds.
As one authority sees it, the unreasonable demands of labor and the sharp rise in material costs earlier this year may have been responsible for the decline In residential building activity in recent months, but the local and federal tax situation has been behind the broader failure of the construction industry to
revive from the depression with anything like the enthusiasm of other industries and markets.

MONEY RATES—
While war-like conditions in many parts of the world are being given credit for the latest market unsettlement, it is more than a mere coincidence that the stock market has suffered one of fts worst breaks in years at the same time that short term money rates have exhibited somewhat stiffer tendencies. Despite the Administration’s efforts to maintain extremely easy credit, symptoms of tightening have been creeping into the picture. The government’s Please Turn to Page Thirteen.

previous issues. Another phase of it is the comment in banking: quarters that the call loan rate may have to be increased from the present 1% level. It is not that there is any real shortage of funds for the call market, but merely that a 1% rate in these times, and with commercial borrowing pointing higher, hardly affords an adequate return.	'
