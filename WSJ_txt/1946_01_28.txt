Stocks thrust forward yesterday to the highest levels for the major rise which started in April, 1942. The market was buoyant from the opening, with transactions totaling 3.480,000 shares, the largest since hlay 21, 1940, when on news of Allied military defeats in France. 3,940,000 shares changed hands. The Ford and Chrysler settlements with the U.A.W. for higher wages and the higher price implications furnished the chief bullish incentive.
Initial offerings were absorbed readily and the ticker shortly after the opening ran late. Leading pivotal issues, including Chrysler, leading steels and General Motors, had delayed openings as brokers matched buying and selling orders. Special issues, the subject of selective buying last week when the standard investment stocks were marking time, advanced sharply on exceptionally heavy buying. The strength and activity of the market proved conclusively that margin transactions, which were ruled out a week ago yesterday, had been a small factor in the forward march of values.
The three Dow-Jones averages closed at new peaks. The industrial average at 204.62 -was up 4,77: the railroads at 67.83 up 1.42. and ths utilities at 41.57 up 0.58. Of the 1,039 issues traded. 839 scored gains while only 103 declined. There were 263 new highs.
Heard on the Street—
The market's response to the week-end nft in the labor clouds was enthusiastic and covered nearly all sections of th? list. Stock* were lively from the start ajid in a short time the ticker tape was running late. • • • A number of the pivotals, notably U. S. SteeL Chrysler. Bethlehem and General Motors, were up to 45 minutes late in opening. • • • But, as one bull long of stocks at considerably lower prices, said, “it was worth waiting for.” • - • Brokers who on several recent occasions tried to buy sizable lines of stock when the market was declining, but without much success. said that the dearth of stocks for sale becomes more pronounced all the time. • • • U. S.-'Steel directors meet this afternoon to consider dividends. Bethlehem directors meet Thursday. • • • Chrysler on its initial transaction was up sharply to a new high for the year. • • • Aircraft stocks, particularly Curtiss-Wright. gave a good account of themselves. bulls on the industry said. • • • Rheem Manufacturing was recommended by one investment house as an undervalued issue, with good earnings and dividend prospects. • • • Attention also was called to Reading Co. The company, one of the railroads that paid dividends all through the 1930s. is in splendid physical and financial shape. With its house in such good order, the Street was pondering the probabilities of an increase in the present $1 annual dividend rate.
* slightly better than the $15.15 in 1944, $15.15 in 1943 and $14.93 in 1942. The yearly average was $15.18 for the four-year period. The extra dividend was the first declared by the company since 1941 when $5 was paid, making a total of $15 for the year.
This month marked the first time since 1936 that the company declared an extra dividend out of the earnings of the preceding year. In January. 1936. the company declared an extra dividend ef $2 out of 1935 earnings, making a total of $10. The regular annual rate then was $8. In 1936. the company paid $8 regular and $5 extra, a total of $13. The quarterly rate was increased to $2.50 from $2 in January. 1937. and this rate has been maintained since. In 1937 the company also paid an extra dividend of $6 making a total of $16, but in 1938 paid only the regular amount. Extra dividends of $5 each were paid in the years 1939 through 1941, but during the war the management adopted the policy of conserving resources and paying only the regular dividend, although it was earned by a 50% margin during the three-year war period." For the first 17 days of January, 44,413 cars of coal and coke were loaded, down 2.S95 cars or 6 1 % front January, 3 945. and 1.666 cars or 3.9% more than December. Total revenue carload traffic in same period decreased 10% from January. 1945. but increased 20% over December. For the first 17 days of January, tidewater dumpings were 243.315 tons, up 89.691 tons, or 58%. over January. 1945, and an increase of 54,668 tons, or 29r>, over December, 1945.
West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co.—
The extent to which corporations were unable during the war to maintain normal plant expenditures is pointed up in the latest financial statement of West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co. In the 10 years. 1932 to 1941. this company's average annual expenditure for plant improvement was around $3 million compared with average annual depreciation and depletion charges of $2.5 million. In the war years 1942 to 1945 only $3.2 million was spent for plant improvement compared with total of depreciatiqn and depletion charges during that period of $16.4 million. In 1943 West Virginia Pulp established a special fund to take care of deferred plant improvement, modernization and property acquisition and this fund at the October 31, 1945 fiscal year-end was $12,412,174. The company already has approved expenditures of approximately $10 million for new plant and equipment.

United Staten Leather Co.—
United States Leather Co., leading: domestic tanner and cutter of heavy leather for shoe soles, reported a moderate decline in net profit for the fiscal year ended October 31. 1945.

Southern Pacific Co.-
Southern Pacific Co., exclusive of its Mexican lines, is estimated to have earned up-
ward of $39 million, or more than $10 a share on 3,772.763 shares in 1945. Of that sum a little more than $1 a share may be credited to the net of accelerated amortization and debt refunding as they affected Federal income tax accruals. The accelerated amortization, after t taking into account the attendant offset from (lowered Federal taxes, affected net income t adversely by $5,174,710 in the last four months of 1945. but the credit against tax accruals resulting from debt changes amounted to $9,039,499, making a net improvement of $3,864,(789 from these sources. Southern Pacific's separately operated and solely controlled affiliated companies in the aggregate dropped back into red ink tn October. 1945, after 29 months of moderate consolidated net profits. The overall loss of such affiliates in the 1945 * final quarter probably was not much more i than $300,000.
i Earnings since August, 1945, have been i held down by a sharp increase in expenditures i for maintenance of way and equipment. Up ito that month, the company had spent an average of about $7 million monthly on maintenance of way and close to $9 million monthly on equipment maintenance . During the last four months of the year, way expenditures averaged $8.5 million and equipment expenditures about $13.7 million.
